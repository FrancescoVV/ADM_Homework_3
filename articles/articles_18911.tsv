Slouch Witch	The Lazy Girl's Guide to Magic #1	Helen Harper	4.06	10591	979	To make one thing clear: Ivy Wilde is not a heroine. Actually, she is the very last witch in the world to be called if you need magical support (which doesn't mean she couldn't!). If it were up to Ivy herself, she would like to hang out on the couch all day, watch series, munch junk food and have arguments with her cat. But due to a bureaucratic mistake, Ivy becomes a victim of a reversed identity and involuntarily - very, very involuntarily! - hurled right into the Arcane Branch, the investigative agency of the Holy Order of Magical Enlightenment. Ivy's problems quickly quadruple when a valuable object was stolen and she was forced to work with Adeptus Exemptus Raphael Winter. Raphael's sapphire-blue eyes somehow make butterflies flutter in Ivy's stomach, but the adeptus actually shows everything that Ivy deeply rejects: the joyless pitfalls of too much stoic witchcraft. And the longer Raphael Ivy sucks, the greater your desire ... to turn him into a frog!	342	June 8th 2017	Ivy Wilde, Raphael Winter		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34670747-slouch-witch
