Damned	Damned #1	Chuck Palahniuk	3.38	47556	3856	The newest Palahniuk novel concerns Madison, a thirteen year old girl who finds herself in Hell, unsure of why she will be there for all eternity, but tries to make the best of it. The author described the novel as "if The Shawshank Redemption had a baby by The Lovely Bones and it was raised by Judy Blume." And "it's kind of like The Breakfast Club set in Hell."	256	October 18th 2011	Madison "Maddy" Spencer	Hell	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9912994-damned
