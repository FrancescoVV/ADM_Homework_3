Because I'm Worth It	Gossip Girl #4	Cecily von Ziegesar	3.56	15407	361	Welcome to New York City's Upper East Side, where my friends and I live fabulously, go to school occasionally, and play—constantly. Enter the world of Gossip Girl–a world of jealousy and betrayal, where everything is hip, beautiful, and far more fantastic than anything you ever imagined. It's February and most cities are a cold, great wasteland. But not New York. At least, not my New York. Our college applications are in and it's time to view off some steam. Best of all, Fashion Week is just around the corner, giving us plenty of opportunities to get dressed up and go completely wild. And just think: The later you stay out, the quicker the days will blur by. See you out there! You know you love me, gossip girl	234	October 1st 2003		New York City's Upper East Side (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47922.Because_I_m_Worth_It
