The Sunset Strip Diaries		Amy Asbury	3.55	298	29	The true story of the social ascent (and eventual decline) of a girl in the Sunset Strip music scene of the early 1990's. From crazy parties to glittered junkies and man-eating strippers, Amy has chronicled what life was like back in the days of excess and debauchery. It is not just a fascinating look into an amusing time in pop culture, but also details the mindset of a young woman trying to find confidence and self-worth in a life full of pain and chaos. The party came screeching to a halt when the Grunge movement took over and heroin became more prominent. How far off track can a person go before it's too late?	334	December 21st 2010		Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10079837-the-sunset-strip-diaries
