Pride and Prejudice and Zombies	Pride and Prejudice and Zombies #1	Seth Grahame-Smith, Jane Austen	3.30	130041	13048	“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.” So begins Pride and Prejudice and Zombies , an expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem. As our story opens, a mysterious plague has fallen upon the quiet English village of Meryton—and the dead are returning to life! Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace, but she’s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy. What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers—and even more violent sparring on the blood-soaked battlefield. Can Elizabeth vanquish the spawn of Satan? And overcome the social prejudices of the class-conscious landed gentry? Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses,	320	2009	Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet, Jane Bennet, Elizabeth Bennet, Mary Bennet, Kitty Bennet, Lydia Bennet, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Georgiana Darcy, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Colonel Fitzwilliam, Victoria Kitchen, Charles Bingley, George Wickham, Mr. William Collins, Zombies	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5899779-pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies
