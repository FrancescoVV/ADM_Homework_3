You're the One That I Want	Gossip Girl #6	Cecily von Ziegesar	3.71	18603	241	Welcome to New York City's Upper East Side, where my friends and I live in gorgeous apartments, go to exclusive private schools, and make Manhattan our own personal playground. It might look hard to be this fabulous, but for us it's as easy as sleeping with your best friend's boyfriend. Enter the world of Gossip Girl - a world of jealousy, betrayal, and $400 Christian Louboutin sandals. Our college acceptance letters are arriving today. Those who do best will act all shocked and modest; the ones who fail miserably will declare how unimportant it all is, even though they secretly know they are doomed; Fee Fie Foe Fum, I smell a cat fight! But after today it's time to get back to what's important: our love lives. Can't wait for this day to be over so the real fun can begin!! Good luck, everybody. You know you love me, gossip girl	230	October 2004	Serena van der Woodsen, Blair Waldorf, Nate Archibald, Charles "Chuck" Bass, Dan Humphrey, Jenny Humphrey, Vanessa Abrams		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22193.You_re_the_One_That_I_Want
