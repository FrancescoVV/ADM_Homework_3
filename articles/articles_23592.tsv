The Nine Lives of Chloe King	The Nine Lives of Chloe King #1-3	Celia Thomson, Liz Braswell	3.78	8135	684	DYING CAN REALLY CHANGE A GIRL'S LIFE. Chloe King is a normal girl. She goes to class (most of the time), fights with her mom, and crushes on a boy... or two. But around her sixteenth birthday, Chloe finds that perhaps she isn’t so normal after all. There’s the heightened night vision, the super fast reflexes – oh, and the claws. As she discovers who she is – and where she comes from – it is clear she is not alone. And someone is out to get her. Chloe has nine lives. But will nine be enough?	773	June 7th 2004	Alyec Ilychovich, Sergei, Paul Morel, Amy, Brian Rezza, Kim, Chloe King, Whit Rezza	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10482783-the-nine-lives-of-chloe-king
