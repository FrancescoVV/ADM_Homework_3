Horseman	Crockett and Crane  #1	Kyle Robert Shultz	4.38	126	59	A new series from the author of the acclaimed Beaumont and Beasley novels! In the year 1790, monster hunter Ichabod Crane searched for a mysterious creature called the Headless Horseman. His quest ended in an embarrassing failure that marked his family with disgrace for generations. Now, in 1891, his descendant Todd Crane is determined to prove that the Horseman is real. There's just one problem--Todd is a professional con artist and a seller of unlicensed magic potions. This puts him on the wrong side of the law and right in the crosshairs of US Marshal Amy Crockett. As the Horseman returns to menace the western frontier, Todd and Amy must join forces to stop the monster once and for all. But if they're going to succeed, they'll have to make sacrifices that will change their lives forever. Enter a Wild West where centaurs wear six-shooters and monsters roam the plains. Welcome to the United States of Neverica. The Crockett and Crane series is perfect for fans of Indiana Jones, Supernatural, or Sleepy Hollow. It is a spinoff of the Beaumont and Beasley series, available now on Amazon.	183	May 24th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42601348-horseman
