Aden Stone has four human souls living inside him: One can time travel. One can raise the dead. One can possess another human. One can tell the future. Everyone thinks he’s crazy, which is why he’s spent his entire life shuffled between mental institutions and juvie. All of that is about to change, however. For months Aden has been having visions of a beautiful girl—a girl who carries centuries-old secrets. A girl who will either save him or destroy him. Together they’ll enter a dark world of intrigue and danger... but not everyone will come out alive.	440	August 18th 2009	Eve, Julian Stone, Victoria Kitchen, Elijah, Riley Narelle Ashon, Aden Stone, Mary Ann Gray, Penny Parks, Dr. Morris Gray, Tucker Harbor, Vlad the Impaler, Shannon Ross	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6344423-intertwined
