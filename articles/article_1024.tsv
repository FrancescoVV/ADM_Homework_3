More Than Love, A Husband's Tale		Peter B. Forster	4.30	7467	20	This book developed from a journal of my thoughts and feelings recorded in response to the shock of my wifeâ€™s diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer in December 2015. Initially, I kept it as a personal diary of things that I believed were important at the time, including the poems and prose I wrote which sprang organically from the events as they unfolded. Whilst these few short months were extremely challenging, at times shocking and ultimately tragic, they were also a time of great love. Hopefully, I have captured some of those few moments of pure happiness, humour and joy which I believe will not only help other people touched by cancer but will show sufferers and their families that there is no right or wrong way to behave, just as long as you continue to show how much you care and as much as possible, be there for each other.	469	December 22nd 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49823970-more-than-love-a-husband-s-tale
