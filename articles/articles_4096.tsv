In the Country of Last Things		Paul Auster	3.87	11534	873	A dystopian epistolary novel. In the Country of Last Things takes the form of a letter from a young woman named Anna Blume to a childhood friend. Anna has ventured into an unnamed city that has collapsed into chaos and disorder. In this bleak environment, no industry takes place and most of the population collects garbage or scavenges for objects to resell. City governments are unstable and are concerned only with collecting human waste and corpses for fuel. Anna has entered the city to search for her brother William, a journalist, and it is suggested that the Blumes come from a world to the East which has not collapsed.	188	1987	Anna Blume, Anne Blume, Samuel Farr, Victoria Woburn, Boris Stepanovich		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486.In_the_Country_of_Last_Things
