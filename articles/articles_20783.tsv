A Sport and a Pastime		James Salter, Reynolds Price	3.69	7833	957	"As nearly perfect as any American fiction I know," is how Reynolds Price ( The New York Times ) described this classic that has been a favorite of readers, both here and in Europe, for almost forty years. Set in provincial France in the 1960s, it is the intensely carnal story—part shocking reality, part feverish dream —of a love affair between a footloose Yale dropout and a young French girl. There is the seen and the unseen—and pages that burn bright with a rare intensity.	185	1967	Philip Dean, Anne-Marie	France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114511.A_Sport_and_a_Pastime
