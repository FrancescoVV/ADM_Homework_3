Dark of the Moon	Dark Guardian #3	Rachel Hawthorne	4.04	6999	256	I've loved him forever, but he can never be mine. Brittany is determined to prove herself to the Dark Guardians. And yet she's been keeping a devastating secret: She hasn't experienced any of the intense, early signs of change that mark a Dark Guardian's transformation. The only intense feelings she has are for Connor - and she's kept that a secret, too. But she knows she'll never truly have Connor's love if she's not a Shifter like him. At the first full moon after her birthday, her greatest fear is realized: She doesn't transform. Brittany is so desperate to become a wolf that she'll go to extremes she never thought possible... and put all the Dark Guardians in incredible danger.	262	2009	Daniel Foster, Rafe Lowell, Lindsey Lancaster, Brittany Reed, Mason Keane, Dr. Keane, Lucas Wilde, Connor McCandless, Kayla Madison		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6058551-dark-of-the-moon
