Coast	Kick Push #2	Jay McLean	4.36	3993	508	One life-changing summer. One boy. The boy. The boy who offered me safe touches and heart-stopping smiles - smiles he shared with his son. We filled our days with porch-step kisses, filled our ears with laughter, filled our hearts with love. Deep, soul-aching, desperate love. But love is misleading. It's an invisible, fleeting moment. Somewhere between false adoration and pure hatred comes an emotion, a vulnerable need, a single desire. It lives within the ones who miss it, who crave it, who know better than to expect it. Love is relentless. Even when that love turns to hate, turns to loathing, turns to pain. Love should heal you. But it can also break you. Believe me, I know... Because I'm Becca Owens - a broken girl... ...And he's Josh Warden - the boy who broke me.	488	June 7th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30192405-coast
