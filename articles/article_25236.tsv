Now, in the summer before their senior year, they're ready for whatevers coming. College? Professional dance careers? They'll share the triumphs and face the tears together. But neither of them are prepared for what does happen next. Jules is diagnosed with cancer. And there is no cure. "An unforgettable debut by a writer to watch. The novel is beautifully composed, with dialogue that never falters, characters who are fully realized, and plotting to make readers turn the pages through their tears." -- Kirkus Reviews , pointer review	272	December 1st 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/303948.A_Time_for_Dancing
