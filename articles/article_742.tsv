The Death Cure	The Maze Runner #3	James Dashner	3.77	339641	23027	It’s the end of the line. WICKED has taken everything from Thomas: his life, his memories, and now his only friends—the Gladers. But it’s finally over. The trials are complete, after one final test. Will anyone survive? What WICKED doesn’t know is that Thomas remembers far more than they think. And it’s enough to prove that he can’t believe a word of what they say. The truth will be terrifying. Thomas beat the Maze. He survived the Scorch. He’ll risk anything to save his friends. But the truth might be what ends it all. The time for lies is over.	325	October 11th 2011	Brenda (Maze Runner), Teresa Agnes, Minho, Gally, Thomas, Newt, Aris Jones, Jorge		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7864437-the-death-cure
