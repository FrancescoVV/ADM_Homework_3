The Glass Arrow		Kristen Simmons	3.65	5489	894	The Handmaid’s Tale meets Blood Red Road in Glass Arrow , the story of Aya, who lives with a small group of women on the run from the men who hunt them, men who want to auction off breeding rights to the highest bidder. In a world where females are scarce and are hunted, then bought and sold at market for their breeding rights, 15-year old Aya has learned how to hide. With a ragtag bunch of other women and girls, she has successfully avoided capture and eked out a nomadic but free existence in the mountains. But when Aya’s luck runs out and she’s caught by a group of businessmen on a hunting expedition, fighting to survive takes on a whole new meaning.	334	February 10th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15750874-the-glass-arrow
