Yi-yun Lin, the deceased, was a foreign student from China. No murder weapon was found on the scene, no sign of forced entry. It was seemingly a homicide, but who was the killer? All the evidence points to her boyfriend, the concert pianist, but Detective Paul Winderman of the Boston Police Department has his doubts. The victim's ex-husband has vowed revenge on several occasions. Someone from her past might also want her dead. The tale of the Mystery of Revenge is a melting pot of love, desire, jealousy and greed. Proceed with caution; the facts could be deceiving.	164	June 11th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17871711-the-mystery-of-revenge
