Pandora Syndrome		April Wahlin	4.80	5	5	After being shot outside a club on her twenty-first birthday, Pandora Todd, aka Dora, finds herself in the bed of a handsome stranger with a pair of snake-like fangs. Now, instead of a hangover, Dora wakes with an intense hunger for blood and the strange ability to control all things dead, a distinctly un-vampire trait. Unfortunately, just when Dora grows accustomed to the vampire aspects of her eternal life, she finds herself targeted by a rival necromancer. Soon, Dora becomes wrapped up in a plot that will shape her past, present, and future.WARNING: This is part of a trilogy and ends on a cliff hanger.	538	November 12th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42927316-pandora-syndrome
