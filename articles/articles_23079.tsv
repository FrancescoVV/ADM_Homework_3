Dungeon Core Academy 1	Dungeon Core Academy #1	Alex Oakchest	3.95	347	19	He was killed in the battle of good versus evil. He was resurrected and given new powers. Now it's time to change sides. Beno doesn't remember much about dying, only that he probably deserved it. When he is resurrected and joins the fantastical Dungeon Core Academy, he learns that not all heroes are heroic, and not all demons are demonic. If he's to earn respect in this diabolical new world, he needs to embrace his inner evil. After learning how to make a deadly dungeon and fill it with murderous monsters, he discovers a golden rule: every hero, warrior, and thief in the world wants to kill him. But Beno isn’t defenseless. He has great powers now, and he can create monsters who love tearing heroes, warriors, and thieves apart. With sword-swinging and magic-wielding heroes hunting him, Beno and his creatures must destroy them and change how all the stories end. This is his second chance at life, and he’s not going to waste it. It's time to stop the heroes from winning. Join Beno in book 1 of the Dungeon Core Academy series, a thrilling fantasy story of magic, power, and heroes.	159	October 9th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52666531-dungeon-core-academy-1
