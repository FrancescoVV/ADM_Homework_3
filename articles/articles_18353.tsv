The Billionaire Rancher's Bargain for A Bride		J.J.  Fox	4.43	7	5	Brooke’s a hired ranch hand. She’s finally landed a dream gig at the Shelton place, a huge, successful Texas longhorn ranch. She’s heard humors about the handsome owner but that doesn’t concern her much. She’s focused on how she’ll earn more and finally be able to support her parents better who went bankrupt on their own ranch. She quickly finds work there challenging. Most of the other workers are male and she has to work hard to prove herself, even though she’s just as capable as them (maybe more so!). Cole is just as tough a nut to crack. He’s constantly surrounded by beautiful women so she writes him off as a playboy. But after a heart-to-heart one night, she realizes that he finds it hard to trust women, as much as he’d love a girlfriend. He finds it lonely at the top. Sparks start flying. But can they both trust each other enough to let love bloom and a real relationship flourish?	73	March 22nd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25206081-the-billionaire-rancher-s-bargain-for-a-bride
