Invisible Monsters		Chuck Palahniuk	3.98	128606	5681	She's a catwalk model who has everything: a boyfriend, a career, a loyal best friend. But when a sudden motor 'accident' leaves her disfigured and incapable of speech, she goes from being the beautiful centre of attention to being an invisible monster, so hideous that no one will acknowledge she exists. Enter Brandy Alexander, Queen Supreme, one operation away from being a real woman, who will teach her that reinventing yourself means erasing your past and making up something better, and that salvation hides in the last place you'll ever want to look. The narrator must exact revenge upon Evie, her best friend and fellow model; kidnap Manus, her two-timing ex-boyfriend; and hit the road with Brandy in search of a brand-new past, present and future.	304	September 17th 1999	Shannon McFarland, Brandy Alexander, Evie Cottrell, Manus Kelley, The Rhea Sisters		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36236125-invisible-monsters
