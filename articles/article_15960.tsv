Vacations from Hell	Short Stories from Hell	Libba Bray, Cassandra Clare, Claudia Gray, Maureen Johnson, Sarah Mlynowski	3.50	4667	408	Life's a beach . . . and then you're undead? in this must-have collection, five of today's hottest writers—Libba Bray ( A Great and Terrible Beauty ), Cassandra Clare ( City of Bones ), Claudia Gray ( Evernight ), Maureen Johnson ( 13 Little Blue Envelopes ), and Sarah Mlynowski ( Bras & Broomsticks )—tell supernatural tales of vacations gone awry. Lost luggage is only mildly unpleasant compared to bunking with a witch who holds a grudge. And a sunburn might be embarrassing and painful, but it doesn't last as long as a curse. Of course, even in the most hellish of situations, love can thrive. . . . From light and funny to dark and creepy, these stories have something for everyone. You definitely won't want to leave this collection at home!	280	May 26th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5168977-vacations-from-hell
