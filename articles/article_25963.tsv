The Romance of Wind & Fire: a.k.a. Hamlet & Juliet (Shakespeare Remix Book 1)		Brady Wilkinson	5.00	1	1	"Where mortal schemes are met with fatal ends when love's performance ceases to pretend." The dramatic re-imagining of Shakespeare's classic. What becomes of "Romeo & Juliet" when cunning Hamlet is born in place of gentle Romeo? A northern wolf is born in place of bracco pup. Where as Romeo was a leaf on the wind, Hamlet moves with dark purpose. The conflict between Montague and Capulet has waged for many years; yet son of Montague, Hamlet, has conspired to bring the drama to its close. His plan: woo Capulet maiden Juliet. Tis a perilous task that shalt surely mean the forfeit of his life should he fail. Be weary dread schemer, for the fruits of thy ambitions may be thy undoing for how often hath love laid low the best plans of man?	162	October 9th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50054687-the-romance-of-wind-fire
