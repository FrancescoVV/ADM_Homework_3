Sin & Chocolate	Demigod of San Francisco #1	K.F. Breene	4.17	13554	939	Some people are ordained for greatness… Those people usually have a lot of drama in their life. Drama I happily do without. I live in a forgotten corner of nowhere for a reason: there is safety in anonymity. I have enough problems just trying to get by. But when Kieran, a sinfully sexy demigod at the pinnacle of power, crashes into my life, suddenly my whole world is turned upside down. He’s harboring a deadly secret, one that could destroy all he holds dear. He thinks I’m the key to his salvation, and he wants me to help him claim vengeance. He also wants me with a passion that burns my body from the inside out. To ignore him is impossible, but to give in to my desires, even for a night, would thrust me into danger I might not survive. Remember what I said about drama? Now I’m in it up to my eyeballs, and I’m not sure if I should run...or fight.	445	October 10th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42196479-sin-chocolate
