The Idiot		Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anna Brailovsky, Eva M. Martin, Constance Garnett, Martin Geeson, Joseph Frank	4.18	133624	5221	Returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women—the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia—both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin’s honesty, goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him. In her revision of the Garnett translation, Anna Brailovsky has corrected inaccuracies wrought by Garnett’s drastic anglicization of the novel, restoring as much as possible the syntactical structure of the original story.	667	1869	Prince Myshkin, Nastasya Filippovna, Rogozhin	St. Petersburg, Russia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12505.The_Idiot
