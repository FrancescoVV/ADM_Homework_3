Unfortunately, the Man doesn't have a Plan - and everything his team tries to find out who really took the ring backfires. Griffin ends up in an alternate school, then under house arrest, and finally with an electronic anklet.	240	January 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7932775-framed
