The Last Watch	Дозоры #4	Sergei Lukyanenko, Andrew Bromfield	4.12	13014	432	The fourth novel in the blockbuster series from one of Russia's most popular authors, Last Watch returns us to the hyper-imaginative world of Sergei Lukyanenko, where the endless battle between good and evil is about to reach its climax. Anton Gorodetsky is just getting a feel for his new powers when his boss, Gesar, sends him to assist the Scottish Night Watch in Edinburgh in a murder investigation. A young Russian man has been murdered—apparently by a vampire. But the mystery is more than it seems, and soon Anton is himself in danger. The murderer appears to be someone with intimate knowledge of the Night Watch. Before long, Anton realizes that a plot is being hatched by the forces of both darkness and light that—unless he can intervene—may mean nothing less than Armageddon.	370	2006	Anton Gorodetsky, Svetlana Nazarova, Boris Ignatievich Gesar, Semyon, Zabulon, Edgar (Day Watch)	Edinburgh, Scotland, Samarkand (Uzbekistan), Moscow (Russian Federation)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2192092.The_Last_Watch
