Hell Night	Mack Bolan the Executioner #351	Jerry Van Cook, Don Pendleton	4.30	23	1	Blood BrothersThe deadliest, most organized threat ever to homeland security is situated in America's own backyard. A violent, militant arm of a neo-Nazi group has forged an unholy alliance with Palestinian terrorists to bring about a mutual goal. They want to generate panic, chaos and bloodshed on America's streets. With limited intelligence available and even less time, Mack Bolan works down a hit list of strikes planned by both groups--at home and abroad. The attacks are intended to destabilize America's military, legal and government institutions, and light the fuse for the fi nal act of terror against the heart of U.S. political power. The Executioner's urgent directive comes straight from the President: do anything to stop this--and do it now.	192	February 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1901277.Hell_Night
