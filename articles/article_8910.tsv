Turtle Moon		Alice Hoffman	3.83	9161	536	When Keith Rosen runs away from his Florida home—inexplicably taking along a motherless baby—his mother is perplexed, terrified, and ultimately takes off on her own journey to find him. The story of a divorced woman, her disillusioned teenage son, and the events that change their lives in ways both simple and extraordinary, Turtle Moon follows their path, in a suspenseful, beautifully written story that confirms once again the exquisite talent of Alice Hoffman.A	275	1992		Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40806.Turtle_Moon
