Iron Kissed	Mercy Thompson #3	Patricia Briggs	4.36	108055	3854	I could smell her fear, and it satisfied something deep inside me that had been writhing under her cool, superior gaze. I curled my upper lip so she could get a good look at my sharp teeth. I might only weigh thirty or so pounds in my coyote shape, but I was a predator... Mechanic Mercy Thompson can shift her shape - but not her loyalty. When her former boss and mentor is arrested for murder and left to rot behind bars by his own kind, it's up to Mercy to clear his name, whether he wants her to or not. Mercy's loyalty is under pressure from other directions, too. Werewolves are not known for their patience, and if Mercy can't decide between the two she cares for, Sam and Adam may make the choice for her...	287	January 2nd 2008	Adam Hauptman, Samuel Cornick, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Honey Jorgenson, Kyle Brooks, Uncle Mike, Gabriel Sandoval, Gray Lords, Ben Shaw, Tim	Kennewick (United States), Umatilla (Fae) Reservation (United States), Kennewick, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1412138.Iron_Kissed
