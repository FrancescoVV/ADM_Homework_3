What's Left of Me	What's Left of Me #1	Amanda Maxlyn	4.28	7718	961	Life works in mysterious ways. Four years ago I became known as the girl with cancer. I refuse to cry. And I refuse to give in. A relationship with a man is the last thing I’m looking for right now, but one night with Parker changes everything. He is persistent, and he knows what he wants. Me. He doesn’t treat me like I’m fragile. But he doesn’t know, and I’m not ready to tell him. What if it changes everything? Tragedy found me when I was seventeen. Love found me when I was twenty-one. My name is Aundrea McCall, and this is my journey.	329	December 9th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18480026-what-s-left-of-me
