Until You	Fall Away #1.5	Penelope Douglas, Nelson Hobbs	4.33	37384	2433	***This novel contains graphic sexual content and harsh language. It is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. Have you ever been so angry that hitting things felt good? Or so numb that you actually felt high? The past few years have been like that for me. Traveling between fury and indifference with no stops in between. Some people hate me for it, while others are scared of me. But none of them can hurt me, because I don't care about anything or anyone. Except Tatum. I love her so much that I hate her. We used to be friends, but I found out that I couldn't trust her or anyone else. So I hurt her. I pushed her away. But I still need her. The sight of her centers me, and I can pool all of my anger into her. Engaging her, challenging her, bullying her...they are my food, my air, and the last part of me that feels anything human. But she left. She went to France for a year, and came back a different girl. Now, when I push, she pushes back.	406	February 18th 2013	Tatum "Tate" Brandt, Jared Trent		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20803962-until-you
