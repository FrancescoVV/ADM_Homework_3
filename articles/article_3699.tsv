Kidnapped	David Balfour #1	Robert Louis Stevenson	3.79	57802	1905	Tricked by the uncle who has stolen his inheritance, young David Balfour is kidnapped and bound for America. Or at least that was the plan, until the ship runs into trouble and David is rescued by Alan Breck Stewart, fugitive Jacobite and, by his own admission, a ‘bonny fighter’. Balfour, a canny lowlander, finds an echo of some wilder and more romantic self in the wilful and courageous Highland spirit of Alan Breck. A strange and difficult friendship is born, as their adventures begin. Kidnapped has become a classic of historical romance the world over and is justly famous as a novel of travel and adventure in the Scottish landscape. Stevenson’s vivid descriptive powers were never better than in his account of remote places and dangerous action in the Highlands in the years after Culloden. ‘A cracking tale of low skulduggery and high adventure, Robert Louis Stevenson’s Kidnapped has enthralled generations of readers since its first publication in 1886. A book for thrill-seekers of all ages, this romp through Jacobite Scotland is a true classic.’ Sunday Herald ‘A delicately balanced book, expertly controlled, sharply focused, and written with an affectionate irony. It is perhaps the finest of Stevenson’s novels.’ Jenni Calder	288	1886	David Balfour, Alan Breck Stewart, Ebenezer Balfour of Shaws, Colin Campbell of Glenure, Ewen MacPherson of Cluny, James Stewart of the Glen	Edinburgh, Scotland, Highlands and Islands, Scotland, Scotland, Essendean , 1751 Queensferry , 1751 Torran Rocks , 1751 Erraid, Scotland , 1751 Cramond, Edinburgh, Scotland Isle of Mull, Argyll, Scotland Torosay Morvern, Lochaber, Scotland Ballachulish, Lochaber, Scotland , 1751 Glen Duror, Scotland , 1751, Essendean, Queensferry, Torran Rocks, Erraid, Scotland, Cramond, Edinburgh, Scotland, Isle of Mull, Argyll, Scotland, Torosay, Morvern, Lochaber, Scotland, Ballachulish, Lochaber, Scotland, Glen Duror, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/325128.Kidnapped
