And best of all, you'll discover that your closest girlfriend is your own truest self, inside you, always ready to offer wise, loving advice about what is best for you. Designed to challenge and guide women to create the relationships they want instead of the ones they often find themselves stuck in, this book is packed with stimulating questions to uncover what's true for you, powerful techniques to change old habits that sabotage your dreams, and real-life experiences shared by the author, her friends, and her clients. Author Christine Arylo, who almost married the wrong guy for all the wrong reasons, speaks to women of all ages, whether they're seeking a relationship, evaluating a less-than-fulfilling one, rebounding from a bad breakup, or working through issues with a partner. "Choosing ME before WE" teaches women to stop settling, to get real about the kind of partner they're looking for, and to start exploring and creating what they truly want in themselves and their relationships.	0	February 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8579999-choosing-me-before-we
