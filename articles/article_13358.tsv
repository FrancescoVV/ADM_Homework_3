ALL HE DESIRES Self-made billionaire Dominic Knight has always been the master of his destiny. From the boardroom to the bedroom, he takes charge of every situation, every impulse, every lover. But now he is ready to tie himself down-to one impossibly alluring woman... Kate Hart thinks of herself as strong and independent. With a brain any tech genius would envy and a body built for pleasure, she has always been in full control of her life. Then she met Dominic Knight... From the moment she first succumbed to temptation, Dominic and Kate have explored every fantasy, every need, and every desire. Bound together in an intoxicating game of passion and possession, seduction and surrender, they have nothing left to conquer---except the possibility of forever. Now from the bright lights of London to the sultry lairs of Paris, Dominic must convince Kate he's ready to make the ultimate commitment. But how long can two lovers teeter on the brink of ecstasy . . . before they fall off?	364	December 5th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18051527-all-he-desires
