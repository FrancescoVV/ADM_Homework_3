Teardrop	Teardrop #1	Lauren Kate	3.60	24920	2529	Never, ever cry... Seventeen-year-old Eureka won't let anyone close enough to feel her pain. After her mother was killed in a freak accident, the things she used to love hold no meaning. She wants to escape, but one thing holds her back: Ander, the boy who is everywhere she goes, whose turquoise eyes are like the ocean. And then Eureka uncovers an ancient tale of romance and heartbreak, about a girl who cried an entire continent into the sea. Suddenly her mother's death and Ander's appearance seem connected, and her life takes on dark undercurrents that don't make sense. Can everything you love be washed away?	441	October 22nd 2013	Ander, the Seedbearer, Eureka Boudreaux, Cat Estes, Noah Brooks, Madame Yuki Blavatsky	New Iberia, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16070143-teardrop
