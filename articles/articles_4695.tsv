Grass	Arbai #1	Sheri S. Tepper	4.06	10588	661	. Generations ago, humans fled to the cosmic anomaly known as Grass. But before humanity arrived, another species had already claimed Grass for its own. It too had developed a culture...... Now a deadly plague is spreading across the stars, leaving no planet untouched, save for Grass. But the secret of the planet's immunity hides a truth so shattering it could mean the end of life itself.	544	1989	Marjorie Westriding Yraier, Brother Mainoa, Rillibee Chime, Sylvan bon Damfel, First/Him		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104342.Grass
