The Happy Prince and Other Tales		Oscar Wilde	4.14	15511	1037	Oscar Wilde made up these very special fairy stories for children. He was telling them more than stories about princes, giants, nightingales, and roses, he was teaching them about life and the way to live it. You will find in them so much sweetness and tenderness you will never forget them. They can be read aloud to children of six, and everybody will want a copy for their own private delight when they are older. There is no age for this book - it is a brilliant and haunting treasure house for everybody. The drawings by the famous Danish artist, Lars Bo, have been specially made for this Puffin edition.	96	May 1888			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/779021.The_Happy_Prince_and_Other_Tales
