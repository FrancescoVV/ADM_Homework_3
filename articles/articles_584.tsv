Cyrano de Bergerac		Edmond Rostand, Eteel Lawson, Lowell Bair	4.07	72207	2073	This is Edmond Rostand's immortal play in which chivalry and wit, bravery and love are forever captured in the timeless spirit of romance. Set in Louis XIII's reign, it is the moving and exciting drama of one of the finest swordsmen in France, gallant soldier, brilliant wit, tragic poet-lover with the face of a clown. Rostand's extraordinary lyric powers gave birth to a universal hero--Cyrano De Bergerac--and ensured his own reputation as author of one of the best-loved plays in the literature of the stage. This translation, by the American poet Brian Hooker, is nearly as famous as the original play itself, and is generally considered to be one of the finest English verse translations ever written.	240	1897	Cyrano de Bergerac, Roxane, Christian de Neuvillette, Count de Guiche, Ragueneau, Le Bret	France, Arras (France), Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15638.Cyrano_de_Bergerac
