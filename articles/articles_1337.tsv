Archibald Finch and the Lost Witches (Archibald Finch #1)		Michel Guyon, Zina Kostich	4.26	262	54	What happened 500 years ago was never supposed to resurface. Exploring his Grandma’s scary manor, Archibald stumbles upon a dark family secret, linked to a time of great fears and superstitions. Key to that mystery: an ancient terrestrial globe, populated by the most fantastic creatures. When he unlocks the storm inside by accident, the risk-averse boy gets whisked into the underworld of Lemurea, where a battle started in the Middle Ages has yet to be settled. Down here, it’s light versus darkness, magic versus fire, witches versus dragons. But not any kind of witches —an army of young girls, with the most magical weapons. And not any kind of dragons —Marodors, enigmatic monsters, part beast, part human, which will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about dragons. While Archibald is thrust into an amazing adventure that will test his survival skills, on the flip side of the Earth, his sister Hailee faces her own challenges. Seeking to solve Archibald’s disappearance, she uncovers the grim plans of a dark priest. Two breathtaking stories, running parallel with one another, but tightly intertwined. Two worlds, on a dangerous collision course... --- The first installment in a phenomenal series, The Lost Witches reads like an addicting thriller —and sets the stage for more adventures to come for Archibald Finch.	350	October 8th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41742807-archibald-finch-and-the-lost-witches
