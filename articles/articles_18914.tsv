Bambi		Veronica .	4.60	35	7	Bambi, the epitome of innocence and born with a beauty so ethereal that it had power to bring any man to his knees. Alpha Ekon, embodiment of strength and masculinity, he was definitely not 'any man' rather 'Alpha of Alphas'. It was definitely a cruel joke when Bambi was mated to Ekon or should I say a beautiful ploy by fate to bring these two souls together; one pure and the other dark.
