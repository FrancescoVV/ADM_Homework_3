The Demigod Diaries	The Heroes of Olympus #Companion	Rick Riordan, Haley Riordan, Antonio Caparo, Steve James, Joann Hill	4.18	44248	1841	What dangers do runaway demigods Luke and Thalia face on their way to Camp Half-Blood? Are Percy and Annabeth up to the task of rescuing stolen goods from a fire-breathing giant who doesn't take kindly to intruders? How exactly are Leo, Piper, and Jason supposed to find a runaway table, dodge a band of party-loving Maenads (who just might be a little psychotic), and stave off a massive explosion...all in one hour or less? With his trademark wit and creativity, Rick Riordan answers these questions and more in three never-before-seen short stories that provide vital back-story to the Heroes of Olympus and Percy Jackson books. Original art, enlightening character interviews and profiles, puzzles, and a quiz add to the fun in this action-packed collection.	244	August 14th 2012		Richmond, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959086-the-demigod-diaries
