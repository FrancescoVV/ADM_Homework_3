The Hellbound Heart		Clive Barker	4.05	39003	2029	In a quiet house on a quiet street Frank and Julia are having an affair. Not your ordinary affair. For Frank it began with his own insatiable sexual appetite, a mysterious lacquered box- and then an unhinged voyage through a netherworld of imaginable pleasures and unimaginable horror… Now Frank - or what is left of Frank - waits in an empty room. All he wants is to live as he was before. All Julia can do is bring him her unfulfilled passions… and a little flesh and blood…	164	November 1986	Frank Cotton, Rory Cotton, Julia Cotton, Kirsty Cotton, Cenobites, Pinhead		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52635.The_Hellbound_Heart
