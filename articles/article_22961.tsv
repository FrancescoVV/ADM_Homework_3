Hot Flashes/Cold Cases (The Peg Shaw series Book 1)		Sue Hawley	4.47	32	15	As far as Peg Shaw is concerned, midlife and menopause have brought enough sweat and excitement to last a lifetime. Unfortunately, there are others who disagree. One night while stumbling back to bed from her nightly visit to the bathroom, Peg is stopped in her tracks by two women standing in her bedroom. As her husband sleeps soundly, Peg abruptly realizes that ghosts have come calling: one is her dead grandmother and the other is her spirit guide. After her grandmother asks her to partner with other spirits to help law enforcement solve crimes, Peg reluctantly agrees to help bring justice to the deceased but persistent ghosts of a local couple. After Peg discovers that cold cases are much more difficult to eliminate than her hot flashes, she travels into unfamiliar territory where her inexperience with murder becomes no match for her determination to rid herself of her uninvited, heartbeat-less guests. After enlisting help from old friends and unexpected allies, Peg uncovers a dark secret at the heart of her sleepy township with the potential to bring more trouble than she bargained for. In this paranormal adventure tale, a middle-aged woman in the throes of menopause is thrust into solving local crimes, with help from her new friends from Deadsville.	249	January 3rd 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30013807-hot-flashes-cold-cases
