Lord of Misrule	The Morganville Vampires #5	Rachel Caine	4.16	45335	1179	In the college town of Morganville, vampires and humans coexist in (relatively) bloodless harmony. Then comes Bishop, the master vampire who threatens to abolish all order, revive the forces of the evil dead, and let chaos rule. But Bishop isn't the only threat. Violent black cyclone clouds hover, promising a storm of devastating proportions as student Claire Danvers and her friends prepare to defend Morganville against elements both natural and unnatural.	246	December 17th 2008	Michael Glass, Shane Collins, Eve Rosser, Claire Danvers	Morganville, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3558003-lord-of-misrule
