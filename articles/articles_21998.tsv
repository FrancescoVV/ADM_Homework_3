The McSterlingscenes		R.L. McSterlingthong, Cortney Marabetta, David Welles, Jaime Mastromonica, Matt Vancil, Scott Brown, David A. Page, Brent Lane, Chris Muffoletto, Fredric Longabard	4.42	12	3	One half grit, one half gumption, one half gallantry; R.L. McSterlingthong IS literacy. An author so infused with unadulterated wisdominance, he continues to blow away genre boundaries with his indelible magnitude. Forged in the fiery crucible of Ridgewood, New Jersey, the twin gifts of writing and storytelling weaved themselves into the very fabric of his clothing at an early age. Now in this limited edition anthology, R.L. shares these blessings with the world - his favorite scenes from his favorite books, written by himself. Within these hallowed pages, you will find truth, horror, love and joy. As with all of R.L.â€™s works, it will open your mind to a small piece of the genius that is McSterlingthong, and it will forever change your life.	134	March 30th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25629401-the-mcsterling-shorts
