Polly Parker and the Star of Hope		Martine Jardin	5.00	1	0	Polly Parker is tired of hospitals, needles, surgeries and chemo. She wants nothing more than to be a normal teenager, to go to school, to make friends, but it will never happen. There is no cure for her. She knows she hasn’t got long to live and has accepted it. She is at peace, knowing she will finally be free of pain, but did it have to happen around Christmas? While reading a book on her laptop, she quietly slips into a coma but is awakened by what she thinks is an angel who calls herself Rhuntana. Has Polly finally been released from her pain? When she sees her parents’ grief and Rhuntana takes her away, she believes she has died and is going to Heaven, but is it really called Kelhatmor? Or is it a final strange fantasy dream before she passes away…	125	December 15th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10660886-polly-parker-and-the-star-of-hope
