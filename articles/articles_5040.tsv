Evil Star	The Power of Five #2	Anthony Horowitz	3.98	16466	535	Matt thought his troubles were over when he closed Raven's Gate . . . but in fact they were just beginning. His fate -- and the fate of the world -- is tied to four other kids across the globe. The second is a street kid in Peru. He and Matt have never met; they don't even speak the same language. But destiny is going to throw them together as the evil threat of the Old Ones grows . . . and another Gate suddenly comes into play. Another masterful thriller from supernaturally suspenseful Anthony Horowitz.	318	December 31st 1999	Pedro, Richard Cole, Matt Freeman		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107670.Evil_Star
