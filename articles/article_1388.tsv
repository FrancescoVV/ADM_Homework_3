Pedro Páramo		Juan Rulfo, Margaret Sayers Peden, Susan Sontag	4.06	42420	3162	A classic of Mexican modern literature about a haunted village. As one enters Juan Rulfo's legendary novel, one follows a dusty road to a town of death. Time shifts from one consciousness to another in a hypnotic flow of dreams, desires, and memories, a world of ghosts dominated by the figure of Pedro Páramo - lover, overlord, murderer. Rulfo's extraordinary mix of sensory images, violent passions, and unfathomable mysteries has been a profound influence on a whole generation of Latin American writers, including Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Gabriel García Márquez. To read Pedro Páramo today is as overwhelming an experience as when it was first published in Mexico back in 1955.	128	March 19th 1955	Juan Preciado	Comala (Mexico)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38787.Pedro_P_ramo
