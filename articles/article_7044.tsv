David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants		Malcolm Gladwell	3.95	148902	9666	In his #1 bestselling books The Tipping Point , Blink , and Outliers , Malcolm Gladwell has explored the ways we understand and change our world. Now he looks at the complex and surprising ways the weak can defeat the strong, the small can match up against the giant, and how our goals (often culturally determined) can make a huge difference in our ultimate sense of success. Drawing upon examples from the world of business, sports, culture, cutting-edge psychology, and an array of unforgettable characters around the world, David and Goliath is in many ways the most practical and provocative book Malcolm Gladwell has ever written.	305	October 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15751404-david-and-goliath
