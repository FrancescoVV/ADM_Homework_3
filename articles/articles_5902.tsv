Without		Brian Dennis Hartford	4.23	158	9	A Vampire Novel that Changes Everything What is forever anyways? To anyone? Ianthe Gold is a Vampire who will do anything to save her one true love, Charlotte Bell Aberdeen. To finally be united with a love that she has been chasing over the millennia, through time and space. Now, she has found the chance to reunite with Charlotte and keep her promise of forever that she had made to her, the soul within, so long ago. But God, as always, has other plans. WITHOUT, is an epic journey set in the modern day. It eloquently and boldly captures both the beauty and the horror of life, this cosmic journey of the flesh, and the soul within God’s grand design. Gritty, ugly, and languishing are just a few emotions evoked as we witness the rise and fall of life and love.	318	December 5th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37242713-without
