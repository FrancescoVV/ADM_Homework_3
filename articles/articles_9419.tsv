Henry and June: From "A Journal of Love": The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin, 1931-1932	From "A Journal of Love" #1	Anaïs Nin	3.89	10575	624	Taken from the original, uncensored journals of Anaïs Nin, Henry and June spans a single year in Nin's life when she discovers love and torment in one insatiable couple. From late 1931 to the end of 1932, Nin falls in love with Henry Miller's writing and his wife June's striking beauty. When June leaves Paris for New York, Henry and Anaïs begin a fiery affair that liberates her sexually and morally, but also undermines her marriage and eventually leads her into psychoanalysis. As she grapples with her own conscience, a single question dominates her thoughts: What will happen when June returns to Paris? An intimate account of one woman's sexual awakening, Henry and June exposes the pain and pleasure felt by a single person trapped between two loves.	304	1986	Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11038.Henry_and_June
