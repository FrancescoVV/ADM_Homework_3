The Broken Kingdoms	Inheritance Trilogy #2	N.K. Jemisin	4.10	24283	1936	In the city of Shadow, beneath the World Tree, alleyways shimmer with magic and godlings live hidden among mortalkind. Oree Shoth, a blind artist, takes in a homeless man who glows like a living sun to her strange sight. This act of kindness engulfs Oree in a nightmarish conspiracy. Someone, somehow, is murdering godlings, leaving their desecrated bodies all over the city. Oree's peculiar guest is at the heart of it, his presence putting her in mortal danger -- but is it him the killers want, or Oree? And is the earthly power of the Arameri king their ultimate goal, or have they set their sights on the Lord of Night himself?	384	November 3rd 2010	Lil, Oree Shoth, Shiny, Madding, Dateh, Kitr, Hado, Serymn, Nahadoth, Sieh, T'vril Arameri, Yeine Darr/Arameri, Itempas		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7904453-the-broken-kingdoms
