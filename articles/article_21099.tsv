Raven	Swann Series #6	Ryan Schow	4.42	26	5	To find yourself, you must end yourself… A boy with a familiar past. An old lover with a secret he’ll kill to protect. A disappearing blonde with an agenda that will blow the Swann universe wide open. In the sixth installment of this mind-bending new series, becoming no one means leaving everyone, and only when you’re truly gone will you know the real you. The only problem? You probably won’t like what you see. Where before our heroine learned to be strong, to fight, to survive, now she must temper those impulses, quell the violence, and embrace humility. Unless she can connect the dots and warm up to some dangerous truths about the future, however, she will never understand the storm headed her way, or how the appearance of a mutilated body in the middle of the desert holds the key to saving humanity itself. AUTHOR’S NOTE: This series contains adult language, strong sexual situations and brutal violence meant for mature readers.	448	February 1st 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34094274-raven
