The Belly of Paris	Les Rougon-Macquart #3	Émile Zola, Ernest Alfred Vizetelly	3.92	4364	367	Part of Emile Zola's multigenerational Rougon-Macquart saga, The Belly of Paris is the story of Florent Quenu, a wrongly accused man who escapes imprisonment on Devil's Island. Returning to his native Paris, Florent finds a city he barely recognizes, with its working classes displaced to make way for broad boulevards and bourgeois flats. Living with his brother's family in the newly rebuilt Les Halles market, Florent is soon caught up in a dangerous maelstrom of food and politics. Amid intrigue among the market's sellers—the fishmonger, the charcutiere, the fruit girl, and the cheese vendor—and the glorious culinary bounty of their labors, we see the dramatic difference between "fat and thin" (the rich and the poor) and how the widening gulf between them strains a city to the breaking point.	660	1873	Claude Lantier, Lisa Quenu		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92965.The_Belly_of_Paris
