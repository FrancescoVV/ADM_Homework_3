Phonological Representations: Their Names, Forms and Powers	Cambridge Studies in Linguistics	John Coleman	0.00	0	0	This book reviews current theories of the sound-structure of words and syllables. Dr. Coleman presents technical arguments showing that the contemporary theories are too complex and that a simpler theory, Declarative Phonology, is adequate. This theory is exemplified with detailed accounts of the sound-structure of words and syllables in English and Japanese.	364	January 29th 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1304584.Phonological_Representations
