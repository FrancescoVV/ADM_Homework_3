A Witch's Beauty	Daughters of Arianne #2	Joey W. Hill	4.14	863	71	Mina is the daughter of an unholy union — a mermaid taken by one of the malevolent Dark Ones. While helping to rescue Prime Legion Commander Jonah, she exposed herself as a potentially dangerous weapon, susceptible to the darkness in her own blood. Now, for the general good, Jonah has angels watching over her... Though Mina is resistant to being protected, her attitude begins to change when David, the human-born angel, is awarded the duty. Looking into his eyes, she can sense that he too knows what it means to fight the darkness within. But — as their passion threatens to take over — will it lead them to Heaven or Hell?	389	January 6th 2009	David Strorm, Mina		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3430165-a-witch-s-beauty
