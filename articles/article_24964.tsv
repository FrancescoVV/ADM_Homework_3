Scorched Skies	Fire Spirits #2	Samantha Young	4.14	4988	263	FEAR THE HEAT... The White King has crossed the line, sounded the horn, sent out the wolves. When blood is shed and life is lost the reality of Ari’s position as both hunter and prey finally sets in. It seems her father will stop at nothing to force her will to his own and distracted by Charlie’s latest mistake and her seemingly misguided attraction to Jai, Ari never thought to fear anyone else but the Jinn King. Blindsided and attacked, Ari learns a new wolf has joined the hunt. A dark sorcerer believes he knows a way to bleed the power of the Seal and wield it as his own, and he is even less patient than The White King. The War for the Seal has only just begun… and it’s time for Ari to turn it on its head. It’s time for Ari to stop acting like the hunted. It’s time for Ari to become the hunter .	350	March 11th 2012	Ari Johnson, Jai Bitar, Charlie Creagh, Fallon Roe		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13108754-scorched-skies
