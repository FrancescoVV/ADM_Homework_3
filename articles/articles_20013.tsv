Pronto	Raylan Givens #1	Elmore Leonard	3.76	8941	758	In the world of Elmore Leonard novels, cops and criminals get by with a grudging respect for each other's capabilities: Harry had been arrested by Buck Torres a half-dozen times or so; they knew each other pretty well and were friends. Not socially, Harry had never met Buck's wife, but friends in the way they trusted one another and always had time to talk about other things than what they did for a living. Right now, 66-year-old Harry Arno's in trouble. In order to get at his boss, Jimmy Cap, the feds told Jimmy that Harry's skimming off the sports book he runs, the idea being that Harry will testify in exchange for protection from Tommy Bucks (a.k.a. the Zip), Jimmy's enforcer. But Harry's got a few tricks up his sleeve. Then when a straight-shooting U.S. Marshall decides to spend his vacation tracking Harry down, all hell breaks loose. Set in Miami, Florida, and Rapallo, Italy, Pronto is another brilliantly executed combination of suspense and black humor from the master of crime fiction. --Ron Hogan	400	1993	Harry Arno, Joyce Patton, Jimmy "Cap" Capotorto, Earl Crowe		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85211.Pronto
