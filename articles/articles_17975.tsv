Lackadaisy: Volume #1	Lackadaisy #1	Tracy J. Butler	4.48	1298	71	St. Louis 0 1927. Times change. Laws change. People still want booze. For the better part of a decade, hidden beneath the inconspicuous Little Daisy Cafe, the city's best-kept secret has slaked the thirst of a prohibition-wearied populace. Lackadaisy. Unfortunately, the once raucous and roaring speakeasy now rests at a crossroads, its golden age seemingly at an end. Lackadaisy's remaining loyalists are left with few options. But with all the cunning, tenacity, and sly ingenuity they can muster, they might just have a chance. And if that doesn't work, fire does.	96	2008		St. Louis, Missouri (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7362781-lackadaisy
