Well Groomed	Tash French #2	Fiona Walker	4.15	1187	19	Wedding bells or one big hitch? Tash French just isn’t sure. If her potty grandmother hadn’t mistaken a Christmas cracker engagement ring for the genuine article, there wouldn’t be a wedding at all. Still less the elaborate, no-expense-spared circus that’s rapidly taking over her life. But at least Tash can be sure of Niall – her actor fiancé. They know his script for the Big Day is already learnt by heart.	698	January 1st 1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1030296.Well_Groomed
