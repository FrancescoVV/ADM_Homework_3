Letters to a Young Artist		Anna Deavere Smith	4.04	620	56	From "the most exciting individual in American theater" ( Newsweek ), here is Anna Deavere Smith's brass tacks advice to aspiring artists of all stripes. In vividly anecdotal letters to the young BZ, she addresses the full spectrum of issues that people starting out will face: from questions of confidence, discipline, and self-esteem, to fame, failure, and fear, to staying healthy, presenting yourself effectively, building a diverse social and professional network, and using your art to promote social change. At once inspiring and no-nonsense, Letters to a Young Artist will challenge you, motivate you, and set you on a course to pursue your art without compromise.	240	January 24th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23468.Letters_to_a_Young_Artist
