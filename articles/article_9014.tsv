The Bastard	Kent Family Chronicles #1	John Jakes	4.11	22398	516	One man’s quest for his destiny leads him to the New World and into the heart of the American Revolution. Meet Phillipe Charboneau: the illegitimate son and unrecognized heir of the Duke of Kentland. Upon the Duke’s death, Phillipe is denied his birthright and left to build a life of his own. Seeking all that the New World promises, he leaves London for America, shedding his past and preparing for the future by changing his name to Philip Kent. He arrives at the brink of the American Revolution, which tests his allegiances in ways he never imagined. The first volume of John Jakes’s wildly successful and highly addictive Kent Family Chronicles, The Bastard is a triumph of historical fiction.	528	September 1st 1974	Philip Kent, Marie Charboneau, James Amberly, Roger Amberly, Jane Amberly, Alicia Parkhurst, Girard., Gil du Motier, Mr. Fox., Solomon Sholto, Anne Ware, Mr. Hoskins., Will Caleb	near Chavaniac, Auvergne (France), Tonbridge, Kent, England (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom), Boston, Massachusetts , 1773 (United States), Boston, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71771.The_Bastard
