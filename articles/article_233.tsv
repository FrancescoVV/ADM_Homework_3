The Screwtape Letters		C.S. Lewis	4.22	333859	11395	The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis is a classic masterpiece of religious satire that entertains readers with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to "Our Father Below." At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters is the most engaging account of temptation—and triumph over it—ever written.	228	1942	Screwtape, Wormwood, The Patient, Screwtape		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8130077-the-screwtape-letters
