Revelation	Matthew Shardlake #4	C.J. Sansom	4.35	19484	1048	Spring, 1543. King Henry VIII is wooing Lady Catherine Parr, whom he wants for his sixth wife. But this time the object of his affections is resisting. Archbishop Cranmer and the embattled Protestant faction at court are watching keenly, for Lady Catherine is known to have reformist sympathies. Meanwhile, a teenage boy, a religious maniac, has been placed in the Bedlam hospital for the insane. When an old friend of Matthew Shardlake is murdered, his investigations leads to connections to both, and to the prophecies of the book of Revelation. Shardlake follows a trail of horrific murders that are igniting frenzied talk of witchcraft and demonic possession. For what else would the Tudor mind make of a serial killer...?	550	April 4th 2008	Matthew Shardlake, Jack Barak, Guy Malton, Dorothy Elliard, Thomas Cranmer	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/820480.Revelation
