A Curse Dark as Gold		Elizabeth C. Bunce	3.59	12294	1601	Charlotte Miller has always scoffed at talk of a curse on her family's woolen mill, which holds her beloved small town together. But after her father's death, the bad luck piles up: departing workers, impossible debts, an overbearing uncle. Then a stranger named Jack Spinner offers a tempting proposition: He can turn straw into gold thread, for the small price of her mother's ring. As Charlotte is drawn deeper into her bargains with Spinner-and a romance with the local banker-she must unravel the truth of the curse on the mill and save the community she's always called home.	396	March 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1743390.A_Curse_Dark_as_Gold
