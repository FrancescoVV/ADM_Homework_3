Females of Valor	The Viking's Kurdish Love #2	Widad Akreyi	5.00	4	0	The beautiful and willful medieval doctor, Vesta, bears the unbearable. Her sufferings are innumerable. Intimidation, humiliation, gang-rapes, loss of loved ones, enforced miscarriage, psychological and emotional abuse, multiple surgeries, purificatory bathes, self-quarantine and isolation – this Kurdish woman has seen it all. The bloodthirsty fanatics who ruthlessly attacked her home seems to disappear without trace or sufficient evidence to aid in her search for justice. Reality is too painful for her husband, Ivar, to handle. He drowns himself in infidelity and alcohol which alters his physical and mental state. In the midst of personal and national tragedies, Vesta is desperate to save her marriage, leave the past behind and give her brutally murdered children a legacy beyond her grief. But in the city of Miafarqin, the potential for disaster is constantly present and females often get trampled under foot. Told in a poetic narrative, The Viking’s Kurdish Love is a compelling love story with captivating characters, stunning plot twists and thought-provoking themes, such as love, hate, pleasure, pain, identity, family, loyalty, betrayal, survival, guilt, revenge and forgiveness.	342	September 27th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55477907-females-of-valor
