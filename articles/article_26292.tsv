The House on Mayberry Road		Troy McCombs	3.62	161	24	A house not only haunted by spirits but infested with beings beyond the limits of human imagination. When four adventurous teenagers go to investigate the supposed ‘haunted house’ out on Mayberry Road, they get more than they‘d bargained for. One boy ends up dead, two others psychotic, and another comatose. The house is not just haunted, it is somehow alive. And extremely dangerous.	300	June 11th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11155935-the-house-on-mayberry-road
