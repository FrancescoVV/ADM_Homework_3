Antichrista		Am√©lie Nothomb, Shaun Whiteside	3.36	6096	336	When Blanche's mother, who finds her own daughter rather colourless, bookish and dull, is also dazzled by Christa, she soon invites her to stay at the family house. Suddenly Christa can do no wrong and, as Blanche's parents scour their address books for long-lost friends to invite to dinner to meet the newcomer, their friendship sours and Blanche's already negligible self-confidence goes into a steep decline. With all the characteristics of Amelie Nothomb's unique fictional landscapes, Antechrista is a funny, dark and revealing journey through female friendship and rivalry.	128	2003	Christa, Blanche	Brussels (Belgium), Malmedy (Belgium)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71456.Antichrista
