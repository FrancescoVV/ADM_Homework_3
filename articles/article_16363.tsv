In His Own Write	John Lennon	John Lennon, Yoko Ono	4.05	5194	216	About The Awful I was bored on the 9th of Octover 1940 when, I believe, the Nasties were still booming us led by Madolf Heatlump (who only had one). Anyway they didn't get me. I attended to varicous schools in Liddypol. And still didn't passâ€”much to my Aunties supplies. As a member of the most publified Beatles my and (P, G, and R's) records might seem funnier to some of you than this book, but as far as I'm conceived this correction of short writty is the most wonderfoul larf I've ever ready. God help and breed you all.	80	January 1st 1964			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95044.In_His_Own_Write
