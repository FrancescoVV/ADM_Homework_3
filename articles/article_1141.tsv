Gilead	Gilead	Marilynne Robinson	3.85	81117	10580	The 2004 Pulitzer Prize winning novel A New York Times Top-Ten Book of 2004 Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction Nearly 25 years after Housekeeping , Marilynne Robinson returns with an intimate tale of three generations, from the Civil War to the 20th century: a story about fathers and sons and the spiritual battles that still rage at America's heart. In the words of Kirkus , it is a novel "as big as a nation, as quiet as thought, and moving as prayer. Matchless and towering." GILEAD tells the story of America and will break your heart.	247	October 28th 2004	John Ames, Reverend Robert Boughton, Jack Boughton	Gilead, Iowa (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68210.Gilead
