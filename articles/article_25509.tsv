Something from Nothing		Phoebe Gilman	4.41	2579	175	The blanket Joseph's grandfather made him is transformed into many things as the years go by: a jacket, a vest, a tie, a handkerchief--and finally a button. Gilman's modern adaptation and lively illustrations turn this favorite Jewish tale into a contemporary classic.	32	January 1st 1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/887573.Something_from_Nothing
