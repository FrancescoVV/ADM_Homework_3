Lessons From A Younger Lover		Zuri Day	4.17	478	41	Zuri Day cranks up the heat with an explosively sexy tale about a woman who's about to get a crash course in lust. . . First grade teacher Gwen Smith was happily married--until her husband got himself a twenty-something mistress and filed for divorce. Now just months away from turning forty-one, Gwen is back in her tiny California hometown, caring for her ailing mother, convinced her life is over. Then she meets Ransom Blake. Ransom is a twenty-six-year-old hunk who pushes every one of Gwen's buttons. Gwen has no intention of getting involved with a younger man, but he won't take no for an answer. So when he shows up at her classroom unannounced, Gwen can't help but tell him off--and then she realizes he's come for his daughter. But Ransom isn't shy about letting Gwen know how she can make it up to him. And if he gets his way, Gwen will lose all her inhibitions--and her heart. . . "An exciting read. Zuri Day does a fantastic job. . ." --Urban Reviews on Lies Lovers Tell	360	2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7148705-lessons-from-a-younger-lover
