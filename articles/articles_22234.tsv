Breaking Shaun	Breaking Free #2	E.M. Abel	4.02	1039	159	No matter how fiercely guarded, even the strongest hearts can break. Some men fall in love but not Shaun. Surfing and his freedom were the only two things he’s ever needed. Meaningless one-night stands were fun but rarely worth the drama. Until he met Natalie, Shaun never realized there were women who felt like him. She enjoys sex with no strings and has no desire for love. He’s finally met his match. But how long can friends with benefits last? **Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and drug use.**		May 26th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39665182-breaking-shaun
