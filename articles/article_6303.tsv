The Diary of a Nobody		George Grossmith, Weedon Grossmith	3.71	13133	1050	Weedon Grossmith's 1892 book presents the details of English suburban life through the anxious and accident-prone character of Charles Pooter. Pooter's diary chronicles his daily routine, which includes small parties, minor embarrassments, home improvements, and his relationship with a troublesome son. The small minded but essentially decent suburban world he inhabits is both hilarious and painfully familiar. This edition features Weedon Grossmith's illustrations and an introduction which discusses the story's social context.	176	1892	Charles Pooter, Lupin Pooter, Mr Cummings, Mr Gowing, Carrie Pooter	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535856.The_Diary_of_a_Nobody
