The Laws of Lifetime Growth: Always Make Your Future Bigger Than Your Past		Dan Sullivan, Catherine Nomura	3.98	441	50	Compared to Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins as a visionary thinker, Dan Sullivan brings practical, powerful new approaches to success in life and business. "The Laws of Lifetime Growth outlines ten "laws" that give readers an internal framework for taking charge of their future. All it takes to use each of these laws is a slight shift in thinking, which anyone -- regardless of age, environment, or stage in life -- can instantly accomplish. Based on Sullivan's years of coaching in which he discovered what motivates people and unlocks their greatest abilities, "The Laws of Lifetime Growth explains how to use such timeless wisdom as "Always make your confidence greater than your comfort" and "Always make your contribution bigger than your reward." Sullivan's laws, startling in their simplicity, show readers how to stay focused and firm so that they can continually grow in all areas of life.	127	January 19th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/624053.The_Laws_of_Lifetime_Growth
