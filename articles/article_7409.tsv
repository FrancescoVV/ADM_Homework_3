Ramona the Pest	Ramona Quimby #2	Beverly Cleary	4.06	61599	1463	This is the second title in the hugely popular series about Ramona Quimby. Ramona doesn't think she's a pest - she knows that she isn't a pest on purpose. So how in the world does Ramona get in trouble? Why does Davy run away whenever Ramona comes near him? And how does she manage to disrupt the whole kindergarten class during their rest time? Beverly Cleary is one of America's most popular authors and has won many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award. Ramona the Pest is being published to coincide with the publication of the lastest Ramona title, Ramona's World.	192	1968	Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, Beezus Quimby	Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78039.Ramona_the_Pest
