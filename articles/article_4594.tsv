Flooded (Beautiful but Strange, #1)		J.J. Sorel	4.36	312	20	Sam Chalmer, the only son of a billionaire tycoon, and Juniper Berry, who was raised by hippies, meet when she chains herself to a tree that his firm plans to chop down. His attempts at sweet talking her fails and a storm comes through. The low-lying land starts to flood. From enemy to hero, he saves her after she loses the key to the chain. The streets are flooded. The hotels are full. They end up sharing a room. And it’s there, in close confines, while sharing a bottle of tequila that they discover that sexual chemistry does not discriminate. They accidentally fall in love. That’s the easy part, because it’s not that simple, especially when impossible promises are made. What follows is one problem after another. He has to prove to her that he’s not the devil in a suit by promising to save that tree. In return for keeping the tree alive, he promises his father to court a wealthy heiress. She’s carrying her own secret: their first night together delivered more than insatiable lust. Boasting chemistry that is off the charts, the couple, unable to take their hands off each other, have to grapple with misconceptions, expectations, and misunderstandings.	148	July 10th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51492267-flooded
