Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow	Idle Thoughts #1	Jerome K. Jerome	3.87	2403	233	Jerome Klapka Jerome (1859 - 1927), English author, known for his humorous essays."What readers ask nowadays in a book is that it should improve, instruct, and elevate. This book wouldn't elevate a cow. I cannot conscientiously recommend it for any useful purposes whatever. All I can suggest is that when you get tired of reading 'the best hundred books, ' you may take this up for half an hour. It will be a change." (from the Preface to "Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow by Jerome Jerome)	95	1886			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/842309.Idle_Thoughts_of_an_Idle_Fellow
