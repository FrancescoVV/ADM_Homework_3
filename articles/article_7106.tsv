Anew	The Archers of Avalon #1	Chelsea Fine	3.91	14164	977	Two years ago, Scarlet awoke in the forest alone, afraid, and unable to remember anything. Lost and confused, her life was a mystery...until she met a boy with a familiar voice. Gabriel Archer has a voice from her past, and Scarlet's determined to remember why. She immerses herself in his life only to discover he has a brother he's kept hidden from her: Tristan Archer. Upon meeting Tristan, Scarlet's world becomes even more muddled. While she's instinctively drawn to Gabriel, she's impossibly drawn to Tristan--and confused out of her mind. As she tries to piece together her history Scarlet realizes her past...might just be the death of her.	385	December 5th 2011	Heather, Tristan Archer, Gabriel Archer, Scarlet Jacobs		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12875436-anew
