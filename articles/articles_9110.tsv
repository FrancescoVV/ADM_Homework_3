A Quiet Kind of Thunder		Sara  Barnard	4.00	8294	1575	Steffi doesn't talk, but she has so much to say. Rhys can't hear, but he can listen. Their love isn't a lightning strike, it's the rumbling roll of thunder. Steffi has been a selective mute for most of her life - she's been silent for so long that she feels completely invisible. But Rhys, the new boy at school, sees her. He's deaf, and her knowledge of basic sign language means that she's assigned to look after him. To Rhys, it doesn't matter that Steffi doesn't talk, and as they find ways to communicate, Steffi finds that she does have a voice, and that she's falling in love with the one person who makes her feel brave enough to use it. From the bestselling author of Beautiful Broken Things comes a love story about the times when a whisper is as good as a shout.	307	January 12th 2017	Steffi Brons, Rhys Gold	Bedfordshire, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30197201-a-quiet-kind-of-thunder
