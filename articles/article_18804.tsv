Soulsmith	Cradle #2	Will Wight	4.42	10828	316	Outside Sacred Valley, ancient ruins rise from the earth, drawing sacred artists from miles around to fight for the treasures within. Lindon has reached Copper, taking the first step on the road to power, but the warriors of the outside world are still far beyond him. To advance, he turns to the arcane skills of the Soulsmiths, who craft weapons from the stuff of souls. With new powers come new enemies, and Lindon soon finds himself facing an entire sect of Golds.	286	September 26th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283608-soulsmith
