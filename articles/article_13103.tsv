Taking Back Forever	Kindrily #2	Karen Amanda Hooper	4.20	1063	202	*Recommended for ages 15 and older due to mature content.* Forever is worth the fight. Maryah erased all memory of her past lives, but she couldn’t erase her soul mate Nathan, or his undying love. Now, Maryah and Nathan have a second chance at a future together, but first Maryah must remember the person she used to be and embrace her supernatural gifts—more than one kindrily member’s life depends on it. Maryah’s power is Harmony’s best hope of finding her kidnapped soul mate, Gregory. But Harmony isn’t big on asking anyone for help, and she’s tired of waiting, so she’s taking matters into her own hands. Heaven help anyone who stands in her way.	365	May 29th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43604707-taking-back-forever
