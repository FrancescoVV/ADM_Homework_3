I have everything that was supposed to be yours. In case you were wondering; he doesn't ever think about you anymore. I won't let him go....ever. Dirty Red Leah Smith finally has everything she has ever wanted. Except she doesn't. Her marriage feels more like a loan than a lifelong commitment, and the image she has worked so hard to build is fraying before her eyes. With a new role and a past full of secrets, Leah must decide how far she is willing to go to keep what she has stolen.	265	December 21st 2012	Olivia Kaspen, Caleb Drake, Leah Smith, Noah Stein, Cammie Chase, Samuel Foster, Seth Drake		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15832316-dirty-red
