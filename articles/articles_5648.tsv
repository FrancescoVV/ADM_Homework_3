The Betrothed		Alessandro Manzoni, Bruce Penman	3.83	6553	480	“The great plague novel.” — The New Yorker Set in Lombardy during the Spanish occupation of the late 1620s, The Betrothed tells the story of two young lovers, Renzo and Lucia, prevented from marrying by the petty tyrant Don Rodrigo, who desires Lucia for himself. Forced to flee, they are then cruelly separated, and must face many dangers including plague, famine and imprisonment, and confront a variety of strange characters—the mysterious Nun of Monza, the fiery Father Cristoforo and the sinister “Unnamed”—in their struggle to be reunited. A vigorous portrayal of enduring passion, The Betrothed‘s exploration of love, power, and faith presents a whirling panorama of seventeenth-century Italian life and is one of the greatest European historical novels. “The 19th-century Italian literary classic renowned for its vivid descriptions of the 1630 pestilence that gutted Milan.” — The New York Times “Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, The Betrothed gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631.” — Politico “This is not just a book; it offers consolation to the whole of humanity.” — Giuseppe Verdi	720	1840	Lorenzo Tramaglino, Lucia Mondella, Don Abbondio, Fra Cristoforo, Don Rodrigo, Agnese, Gertrude, the Nun of Monza, Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, Donna Prassede	Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/566328.The_Betrothed
