The Book of Lost Things		John Connolly	3.95	70083	7890	High in his attic bedroom, twelve-year-old David mourns the death of his mother, with only the books on his shelf for company. But those books have begun to whisper to him in the darkness. Angry and alone, he takes refuge in his imagination and soon finds that reality and fantasy have begun to meld. While his family falls apart around him, David is violently propelled into a world that is a strange reflection of his own -- populated by heroes and monsters and ruled by a faded king who keeps his secrets in a mysterious book, The Book of Lost Things . Taking readers on a vivid journey through the loss of innocence into adulthood and beyond, New York Times bestselling author John Connolly tells a dark and compelling tale that reminds us of the enduring power of stories in our lives.	339	November 7th 2006	David Strorm, Little Red Riding Hood, Seven Dwarves, The Woodsman, The Crooked Man, Jonathan Tulvey, Roland the Soldier, Snow White (John Connolly)	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69136.The_Book_of_Lost_Things
