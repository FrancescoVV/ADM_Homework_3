Two Witnesses		Madison G. Blackwell	4.00	2	0	Before the age of humankind, and even before the age of dinosaurs, there was a time when dragons lived upon the earth. Quite different than we imagine them now, they had a civilized society, a social hierarchy, and a strong religious tradition. This religious culture, however, was oppressive and worshipped some of their own kind as gods. When a young dragon named Ogg hears of an ancient, hidden city that is the very definition of paradise, he defies the religious laws, embraces the life of a pariah, and sets off on his journey. Nothing he learned from his life in the villages of dragons could have prepared him for the radical liberation and enlightenment that awaits him on his journey. But these revelations will come at a price... The Two Witnesses is a Christian allegory with strong imagery, vivid characters, and an exotic mythology. The enlightening parallels between our modern world and the ancient one portrayed here are driven by its fast-paced storyline and vibrant settings. Glean spiritual wisdom and insight from this exciting tale told in an entirely new and wonderful way.	87	July 6th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8666973-two-witnesses
