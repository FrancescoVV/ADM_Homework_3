Notes from Underground, White Nights, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and Selections from The House of the Dead		Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Andrew R. MacAndrew, Ben Marcus	4.18	73849	1720	A collection of powerful stories by one of the masters of Russian literature, illustrating the author's thoughts on political philosophy, religion and above all, humanity: Notes from Underground, White Nights, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and Selections from The House of the Dead (150th Anniversary Edition) The compelling works presented in this volume were written at distinct periods in Dostoyevsky's life, at decisive moments in his groping for a political philosophy and a religious answer. From the primitive peasant who kills without understanding that he is destroying life to the anxious antihero of Notes from Underground —who both craves and despises affection—the writer's often-tormented characters showcase his evolving outlook on our fate. Thomas Mann described Dostoyevsky as "an author whose Christian sympathy is ordinarily devoted to human misery, sin, vice, the depths of lust and crime, rather than to nobility of body and soul" and Notes from Underground as "an awe- and terror- inspiring example of this sympathy."	233	1864			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17876.Notes_from_Underground_White_Nights_The_Dream_of_a_Ridiculous_Man_and_Selections_from_The_House_of_the_Dead
