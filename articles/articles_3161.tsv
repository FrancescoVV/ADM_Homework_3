The Man Who Planted Trees		Jean Giono	4.24	8356	938	Simply written, but powerful and unforgettable, The Man Who Planted Trees is a parable for modern times. In the foothills of the French Alps the narrator meets a shepherd who has quietly taken on the task of planting one hundred acorns a day in an effort to reforest his desolate region. Not even two world wars can keep the shepherd from continuing his solitary work. Gradually, this gentle, persistent man's work comes to fruition: the region is transformed; life and hope return; the world is renewed.	74	1953	Elz√©ard Bouffier	Provence (France), France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/757438.The_Man_Who_Planted_Trees
