Promethea: Book One	Promethea #1	Alan Moore, J.H. Williams III, Mick Gray	3.90	11720	501	The first graphic novel from America's Best Comics, like all titles from ABC, is written and created by Alan Moore, writer of Watchmen, the classic Swamp Thing, and V for Vendetta. Boasting some of Moore's most powerful writing in years, this volume introduces Promethea, a powerful figure who appeared in Victorian children's stories and turn-of-the-century comic strips and gains new life through Sophie Bangs, a college student in alternate-reality New York City. But as this exotic heroine leaps into battle, will Sophie's personality be able to reemerge when the battle is over?		March 2000	Promethea		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821800.Promethea_Vol_1
