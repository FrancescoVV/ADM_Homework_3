Diary of an Early American Boy		Eric Sloane	4.21	705	81	Part the diary of Noah Blake, who was 15 in 1805, and part a re-creation of the life that a boy in his circumstances would have lived, this book is a loving tribute to a vanished way of life. Profusely illustrated, it will give its readers a sense of participation in the past that is all too rare in conventional histories.	128	March 28th 1958			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/977445.Diary_of_an_Early_American_Boy
