The Sky Is Everywhere		Jandy Nelson	3.99	91364	9373	Adrift after her sister Bailey's sudden death, Lennie finds herself torn between quiet, seductive Toby—Bailey's boyfriend who shares her grief—and Joe, the new boy in town who bursts with life and musical genius. Each offers Lennie something she desperately needs... though she knows if the two of them collide her whole world will explode. Join Lennie on this heartbreaking and hilarious journey of profound sorrow and mad love, as she makes colossal mistakes and colossal discoveries, as she traipses through band rooms and forest bedrooms and ultimately right into your heart. As much a celebration of love as a poignant portrait of loss, Lennie's struggle to sort her own melody out of the noise around her is always honest, often uproarious, and absolutely unforgettable.	275	March 6th 2010	Lennie Walker, Joe Fontaine, Gram, Toby Shaw, Bailey Walker, DougFred Fontaine, Marcus Fontaine	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6604794-the-sky-is-everywhere
