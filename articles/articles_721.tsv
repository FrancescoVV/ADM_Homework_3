The Jungle Books	The Jungle Book #1-2	Rudyard Kipling, Alev Lytle Croutier	4.01	83691	1104	The Jungle Books can be regarded as classic stories told by an adult to children. But they also constitute a complex literary work of art in which the whole of Kipling's philosophy of life is expressed in miniature. They are best known for the 'Mowgli' stories; the tale of a baby abandoned and brought up by wolves, educated in the ways and secrets of the jungle by Kaa the python, Baloo the bear, and Bagheera the black panther. The stories, a mixture of fantasy, myth, and magic, are underpinned by Kipling's abiding preoccupation with the theme of self-discovery, and the nature of the 'Law'.	368	1894	Mowgli (Rudyard Kipling), Bagheera (Rudyard Kipling), Hathin, Shere Khan, Baloo (Rudyard Kipling), Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, Nagaina, Darzee, Messua, Akela, Kaa, Tabaqui, Nag		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41684.The_Jungle_Books
