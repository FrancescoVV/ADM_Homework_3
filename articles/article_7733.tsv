Rumors	Luxe #2	Anna Godbersen, Анна Годберзен	3.85	37642	1882	After bidding good-bye to New York's brightest star, Elizabeth Holland, rumors continue to fly about her untimely demise. All eyes are on those closest to the dearly departed: her mischievous sister, Diana, now the family's only hope for redemption; New York's most notorious cad, Henry Schoon-maker, the flame Elizabeth never extinguished; the seductive Penelope Hayes, poised to claim all that her best friend left behindâ€”including Henry; even Elizabeth's scheming former maid, Lina Broud, who discovers that while money matters and breeding counts, gossip is the new currency. As old friends become rivals, Manhattan's most dazzling socialites find their futures threatened by whispers from the past. In this delicious sequel to The Luxe , nothing is more dangerous than a scandal . . . or more precious than a secret.	423	January 1st 2008	Elizabeth Holland, Henry Schoonmaker, Diana Holland, Penelope Hayes, Lina Broud	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2218252.Rumors
