Lake in the Clouds	Wilderness #3	Sara Donati	4.34	12937	446	Lake in the Clouds In her extraordinary novels Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, award-winning author Sara Donati deftly captured the vast, untamed wilds of late-eighteenth-century New York and the trials and triumphs of the spirited Bonner family. Now she takes on a new chapter in the life of Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner--as their brave and beautiful oldest daughter comes of age with a challenge that will change her forever. . . . It is the spring of 1802 and the village of Paradise is still reeling from the typhoid epidemic of the previous summer. But despite a devastating personal loss, the Bonners persevere, with Hannah, Nathaniel's half-Indian daughter, working as a doctor in training. A gifted healer, this striking young woman of two worlds finds herself in peril when a dangerously ill runaway slave is discovered near the family home and Hannah insists on nursing the outlaw. Her determination places both her family and her heart in jeopardy, for a bounty hunter is afoot--and he is none other than Hannah's childhood friend and first love. So begins a journey that will test the strength of the Bonners' love for one another--and bring Hannah to face the decision she has always dreaded: will she make a life for herself in a white world, or among her mother's people?	651	May 17th 2002	Elizabeth Middleton, Nathaniel Bonner, Dan'l Bonner, Hannah Bonner, Runs-from-Bears, Many-Doves, Richard Todd, Kitty Witherspoon, Daniel Bonner, Lily Bonner, Curiosity Freeman, Ethan Middleton, Selah Voyager, Manny Freeman, Liam Kirby, Jemima Southern	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72855.Lake_in_the_Clouds
