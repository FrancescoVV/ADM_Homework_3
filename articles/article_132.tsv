Fight Club		Chuck Palahniuk	4.19	500792	14592	Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation’s most visionary satirist in this, his first book. Fight Club ’s estranged narrator leaves his lackluster job when he comes under the thrall of Tyler Durden, an enigmatic young man who holds secret after-hours boxing matches in the basement of bars. There, two men fight "as long as they have to." This is a gloriously original work that exposes the darkness at the core of our modern world.	218	1996	The Narrator, Tyler Durden, Marla Singer	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36236124-fight-club
