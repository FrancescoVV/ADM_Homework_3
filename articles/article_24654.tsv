Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?: The Improbable Saga of the New York Mets' First Year		Jimmy Breslin, Bill Veeck	3.96	541	59	Here, back in print, is Jimmy Breslin's marvelous account of the improbable saga of the New York Mets' first year, as Bill Veeck notes in his Introduction, "preserving for all time a remarkable tale of ineptitude, mediocrity, and abject failure." Indeed the 1962 Mets were the worst major league baseball team ever to take the field. (The title of the book is a quote from Casey Stengel, their manager at the time.) Breslin casts the Mets, who lost 120 games out of a possible 162 that year, as a lovable bunch of losers. And, he argues, they were good for baseball, coming as a welcome antidote to "the era of the businessman in sports...as dry and agonizing a time as you would want to see." Although they were written forty years ago, many of Breslin's comments will strike a chord with today's sports fan, fed up with the growing commercialism of the games. Against this trend Breslin sets the exploits of "Marvelous" Marv Throneberry, Stengel, and the rest of the hapless Mets. "Wonderful."--Charles Salzberg, New York Times. "A touching, enjoyable, and interesting addition to anybody's sports reading list."--Patrick Conway	126	April 28th 1963			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/406591.Can_t_Anybody_Here_Play_This_Game_
