Cress: Chapters 1-5		Marissa Meyer	4.63	1531	66	Download the first five chapters of CRESS by Marissa Meyer, the third book in the New York Times bestselling Lunar Chronicles series. Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, they’re plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army. Their best hope lies with Cress, who has been trapped on a satellite since childhood with only her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker – unfortunately, she’s just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. When a daring rescue goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing stop her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only ones who can.	55	December 2nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18665229-cress
