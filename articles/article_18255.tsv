Seven Wakings		S.K. McCauley	4.12	94	20	After Emma James— a widowed mother and child protection agent— is murdered to cover up a kidnapping ring, she reincarnates to solve the crimes. With SEVEN WAKINGS, Emma finds herself as: a homeless African American man, a sex-crazed lady of means, a morbidly obese Caucasian woman, a dashing lawyer with a hidden agenda, an innocent girl in shackles, a ruthless double-life cop, and an aging billionaire with a lifetime of secrets. But, challenging incarnations are nothing compared to navigating the dark world of crooked cops, pedophile cults, and murderous plots— with only the help of her best friend, two kids and a rookie cop. Are things as they appear, or could there be help that even the resurrected can’t see?	214	May 14th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22354029-seven-wakings
