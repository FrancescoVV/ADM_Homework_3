Goat Mountain		David Vann	3.30	1355	258	A shocking, suspenseful and daring new novel from one of the greatest American writers at work today, whose previous books include Caribou Island , Dirt and Legend of a Suicide . In David Vann’s searing novel Goat Mountain , an eleven-year-old boy is eager to make his first kill at his family’s annual deer hunt. But all is not as it should be. His father discovers a poacher on the land, a 640-acre ranch in Northern California, and shows him to the boy through the scope of his rifle. With this simple gesture, tragedy erupts, shattering lives irrevocably. Set over the course of one hot and hellish weekend, Goat Mountain is the story of a family struggling to contend with a terrible crime and its repercussions. David Vann creates a haunting and provocative novel that explores our most primal urges and beliefs, the bonds of blood and religion that define and secure us, and the consequences of our actions – what we owe for what we’ve done. Dark, disturbing and unbearably tense, this is the startling new novel from David Vann, ‘ one of the best writers of his generation’ ( Le Figaro ).	256	January 1st 2013		Goat Mountain, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349136-goat-mountain
