When high school principal Tom Gardner recognizes a new transfer student as the son he never knew -- the result of a one-night stand on the eve of his wedding years before -- the entire Gardner family is forced to deal with issues they've long denied, and a crisis they never expected. As the revelation takes its emotional toll, everyone involved must find their own way to rebuild their lives, their loves, and their ability to forgive.	432	1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/572648.Home_Song
