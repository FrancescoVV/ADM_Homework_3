A Time to Dance	Timeless Love #1	Karen Kingsbury	4.29	7125	358	John and Abby Reynolds are the perfect couple—envied by their friends, cherished by their children, admired by their peers. But John and Abby know they're just pretending to be happy. In fact, they're waiting for the right time to tell the kids they're going to divorce. But at the family meeting where they plan to tell their children, Nicole shares a surprise of her own: she's getting married. How can they spoil her joy with their announcement? They can pretend a little longer—until after the wedding. But questions begin to haunt them as the date draws nearer. What happened to the love and commitment that held them together for so long? Is it still there somewhere under all the pain and misunderstanding? And is it still possible, alone in the moonlight on an old wooden pier, to once more find . . . a time to dance? The first novel in Karen Kingsbury's celebrated series about the power of commitment and the amazing faithfulness of God.	528	April 28th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115036.A_Time_to_Dance
