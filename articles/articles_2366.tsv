Of Love and Other Demons		Gabriel García Márquez	3.98	56489	2642	On her twelfth birthday, Sierva Maria, the only child of a decaying noble family in an eighteenth-century South American seaport, is bitten by a rabid dog. Believed to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation. And into her cell stumbles Father Cayetano Delaura, who has already dreamed about a girl with hair trailing after her like a bridal train. As he tends to her with holy water and sacramental oils, Delaura feels something shocking begin to occur. He has fallen in love, and it isn't long until Sierva Maria joins him in his fevered misery. Unsettling and indelible, Of Love and Other Demons is an evocative, majestic tale of the most universal experiences known to woman and man.	160	1994	Sierva María, Cayetano Delaura, don Ignacio, Bernarda Cabrera, Abrenuncio, Dulce Olivia, Martina Laborde, don Toribio de Cáceres y Virtudes, Josefa Miranda	Colombia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23876.Of_Love_and_Other_Demons
