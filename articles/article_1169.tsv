An American Tragedy		Theodore Dreiser, Richard R. Lingeman	3.95	31939	1349	'An American Tragedy' is the story of Clyde Griffiths, who spends his life in the desperate pursuit of success. On a deeper, more profound level, it is the masterful portrayal of the society whose values both shape Clyde's ambitions and seal his fate; it is an unsurpassed depiction of the harsh realities of American life and of the dark side of the American dream. Extraordinary in scope and power, vivid in its sense of wholesale human waste, unceasing in its rich compassion, 'An American Tragedy' stands as Theodore Dreiser's supreme achievement. Based on an actual criminal case, 'An American Tragedy' was the inspiration for the film 'A Place in the Sun', which won six Academy Awards and starred Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Cliff.	859	December 17th 1925	Clyde Griffiths, Elvira Griffiths, Asa Griffiths, Esta Griffiths, Hortense Briggs, Thomas Ratterer, Samuel Griffiths, Sondra Finchley, Roberta Alden, Gilbert Griffiths, Orville Mason, Alvin Belknap, Reuben Jephson, Frank Harriet, Mrs. George Newton, Justice Oberwaltzer, Perley Haynes, Mr. Shurlock, Bert Gettler, Sonda, Miss Vanda Steele, Legare Atterbury, Charlie Trone, Tom Keary, Nicholas Kraut, Violet Taylor	Kansas City, Missouri (United States), Lycurgus, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331319.An_American_Tragedy
