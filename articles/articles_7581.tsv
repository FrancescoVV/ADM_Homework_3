Hunter of the Wolf believes that Loretta is a woman of ancient prophecy whom he must honor. But Loretta can only see him as the enemy who has kidnapped her, and she refuses to succumb to his controlâ€”or his touch. Despite the hatred between their peoples, Loretta and Hunter gradually find their enmity changing to respect and care. In the midst of such conflict, it will take all the force of their love to find a safe haven.	480	February 15th 1991	Loretta Simpson, Hunter of the Wolf	Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133499.Comanche_Moon
