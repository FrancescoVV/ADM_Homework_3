Reckoning	Strange Angels #5	Lili St. Crow, Lilith Saintcrow	4.11	12938	893	Nobody expected Dru Anderson to survive this long. Not Graves. Not Christophe. Not even Dru. She's battled killer zombies, jealous djamphirs, and bloodthirsty suckers straight out of her worst nightmares. But now that Dru has bloomed into a full-fledged svetocha — rare, beautiful, and toxic to all vampires — the worst is yet to come. Because getting out alive is going to cost more than she's ever imagined. And in the end, is survival really worth the sacrifice?	307	November 1st 2011	Dru Anderson, Christophe Reynard, Graves		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10710406-reckoning
