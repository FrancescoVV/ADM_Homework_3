Louder, Lili		Gennifer Choldenko, S.D. Schindler	3.83	144	34	Lili is the quietest kid in class. She spends recess inside with Lois, the class's pet guinea pig, and allows Cassidy do her talking for her, even if it means never getting to have the best parts in games. Sometimes it's just easier letting Cassidy be in charge, but will Lili have the courage to speak up when it means keeping Lois from getting hurt? This warm, humorous story will speak to any child learning to find his or her own voice?and children used to being the boss might see themselves reflected in Cassidy's over-the-top antics, as well.	32	September 20th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/799147.Louder_Lili
