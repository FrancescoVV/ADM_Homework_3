Tiger	New Species #7	Laurann Dohner	4.34	16235	692	Book 7 in the New Species series. Zandy's had too much to drink and is in the wrong place at the wrong time. She knows she's going to die. When next her eyes open, a beautiful man-creature is holding her in his arms. He's just too tempting to resist; her very own fallen angel. She wraps herself around his body, determined to have him. But when this angel turns out to be flesh and blood, reality crashes in-she's seducing a New Species. Tiger's shock quickly turns to intense passion when the human female kisses him, despite the fact she's trying to get his clothes off while he's engaged in a task force operation. He's also made it clear he'll never take a mate. Rather difficult when he and Zandy can't keep their hands off each other. The taste and feel of his little human just leaves Tiger wanting more. Publisher's Note: While each New Species book is a standalone, the greatest enjoyment will come from reading them in series order.	221	March 10th 2012	Tiger, Slade, Zandy, Vengeance, Smiley, Obsidian (#880)	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13107666-tiger
