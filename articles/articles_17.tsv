Memoirs of a Geisha		Arthur Golden	4.12	1722579	30170	A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel presents with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. In Memoirs of a Geisha , we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction - at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful - and completely unforgettable.	503	September 23rd 1997	Sayuri Nitta, Mr. Bekku, Ichiro Tanaka, Dr. Crab, Hatsumono, Mameha, Ken Iwamura, Pumpkin, Toshikazu Nobu	Kyoto (Japan), Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/929.Memoirs_of_a_Geisha
