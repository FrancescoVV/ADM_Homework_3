The Reptile Room	A Series of Unfortunate Events #2	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	3.98	185092	6694	Dear Reader, If you have picked up this book with the hope of finding a simple and cheery tale, I'm afraid you have picked up the wrong book altogether. The story may seem cheery at first, when the Baudelaire children spend time in the company of some interesting reptiles and a giddy uncle, but don't be fooled. If you know anything at all about the unlucky Baudelaire children, you already know that even pleasant events lead down the same road to misery. In fact, within the pages you now hold in your hands, the three siblings endure a car accident, a terrible odor, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a large brass reading lamp, and the appearance of a person they'd hoped never to see again. I am bound to record these tragic events, but you are free to put this book back on the shelf and seek something lighter. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket	192	September 30th 1999	Count Olaf, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Arthur Poe, Violet Baudelaire, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery	Lousy Lane	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78418.The_Reptile_Room
