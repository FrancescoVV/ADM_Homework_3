Memoirs of Hadrian		Marguerite Yourcenar, Grace Frick	4.25	19123	1578	Both an exploration of character and a reflection on the meaning of history, Memoirs of Hadrian has received international acclaim since its first publication in France in 1951. In it, Marguerite Yourcenar reimagines the Emperor Hadrian's arduous boyhood, his triumphs and reversals, and finally, as emperor, his gradual reordering of a war-torn world, writing with the imaginative insight of a great writer of the twentieth century while crafting a prose style as elegant and precise as those of the Latin stylists of Hadrian's own era.	347	1951	Antino√ºs, Trajan (emperor), Emperor Hadrian, Vibia Sabina	Rome (Italy), Athens (Greece), Alexandria (Egypt)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12172.Memoirs_of_Hadrian
