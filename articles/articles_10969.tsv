What My Mother Doesn't Know	What My Mother Doesn't Know #1	Sonya Sones	3.82	14149	1566	My name is Sophie. This book is about me. It tells the heart-stoppingly riveting story of my first love. And also of my second. And, okay, my third love, too. It's not that I'm boy crazy. It's just that even though I'm almost fifteen it's like my mind and my body and my heart just don't seem to be able to agree on anything.	261	February 1st 2001	Sophie Kintock, Dylan, Rachel & Grace, Murphy	Cambridge, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170529.What_My_Mother_Doesn_t_Know
