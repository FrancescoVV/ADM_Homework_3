The House of God	House of God #1	Samuel Shem, John Updike	3.93	16812	1196	The hilarious novel of the healing arts that reveals everything your doctor never wanted you to know. Six eager interns—they saw themselves as modern saviors-to-be. They came from the top of their medical school class to the bottom of the hospital staff to serve a year in the time-honored tradition, racing to answer the flash of on-duty call lights and nubile nurses. But only the Fat Man—the Clam, all-knowing resident—could sustain them in their struggle to survive, to stay sane, to love and even to be doctors when their harrowing year was done.	416	1978	Roy Basch, Fat Man		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/401876.The_House_of_God
