Unnatural Causes		Richard  Shepherd	4.35	15790	1307	Meet the forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd. He solves the mysteries of unexplained or sudden death. He has faced serial killers, natural disaster, 'perfect murders' and freak accidents, all in the pursuit of the truth. He's a detective in his own right. And he has one, ultimate and pressing question to answer: How did this person die? Unnatural Causes is an unputdownable record of an extraordinary life, a unique insight into a remarkable profession, and above all a powerful and reassuring testament to lives cut short. If you liked All That Remains and When the Dogs Don't Bark , you'll love this.
