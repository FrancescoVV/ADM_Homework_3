Torment	Fallen #2	Lauren Kate	3.87	209276	7919	Hell on earth. That’s what it’s like for Luce to be apart from her fallen angel boyfriend, Daniel. It took them an eternity to find one another, but now he has told her he must go away. Just long enough to hunt down the Outcasts—immortals who want to kill Luce. Daniel hides Luce at Shoreline, a school on the rocky California coast with unusually gifted students: Nephilim, the offspring of fallen angels and humans. At Shoreline, Luce learns what the Shadows are, and how she can use them as windows to her previous lives. Yet the more Luce learns, the more she suspects that Daniel hasn’t told her everything. He’s hiding something—something dangerous. What if Daniel’s version of the past isn’t actually true? What if Luce is really meant to be with someone else?	452	September 28th 2010	Lucinda Price, Daniel Grigori, Arriane Alter, Cameron Briel, Shelby Sterris, Miles Fisher, Mary Margaret Zane, Roland Sparks, Gabrielle Givens, Dawn Casterly, Lillith Clout	California (United States), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States), Savannah, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7740152-torment
