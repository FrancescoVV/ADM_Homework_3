The Grass Harp, Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories		Truman Capote	4.01	5446	261	Set on the outskirts of a small Southern town, The Grass Harp tells the story of three endearing misfits--an orphaned boy and two whimsical old ladies--who one day take up residence in a tree house. AS they pass sweet yet hazardous hours in a china tree, The Grass Harp manages to convey all the pleasures and responsibilities of freedom. But most of all it teaches us about the sacredness of love, "that love is a chain of love, as nature is a chain of life." This volume also includes Capote's A Tree of Night and Other Stories , which the Washington Post called "unobstrusively beautiful...a superlative book."	272	January 2nd 1956			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9924.The_Grass_Harp_Including_A_Tree_of_Night_and_Other_Stories
