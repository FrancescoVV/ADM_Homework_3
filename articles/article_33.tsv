Anne of Green Gables	Anne of Green Gables #1	L.M. Montgomery	4.26	731941	23160	As soon as Anne Shirley arrives at the snug white farmhouse called Green Gables, she is sure she wants to stay forever . . . but will the Cuthberts send her back to to the orphanage? Anne knows she's not what they expected—a skinny girl with fiery red hair and a temper to match. If only she can convince them to let her stay, she'll try very hard not to keep rushing headlong into scrapes and blurting out the first thing that comes to her mind. Anne is not like anyone else, the Cuthberts agree; she is special—a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreams of the day when she can call herself Anne of Green Gables.	320	1908	Marilla Cuthbert, Matthew Cuthbert, Diana Barry, Gilbert Blythe, Rachel Lynde, Anne Shirley, Jane Andrews, Ruby Gillis, Josie Pye, Prissy Andrews, Mr. Phillips, Mrs. Allan	Avonlea, Prince Edward Island (Canada), Prince Edward Island (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8127.Anne_of_Green_Gables
