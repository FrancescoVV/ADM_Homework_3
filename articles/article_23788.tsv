Diana, A Cultural History: Gender, Race, Nation and the People's Princess		Jude Davies	3.88	8	1	This book intervenes in debates over the significance of Diana, Princess of Wales, by offering a critical account of her status as a media icon from 1981 to the present. It outlines the historical development of representations of Diana, analyzing the ways in which she has been understood via discourses of gender, sexuality, race, economic class, the royal, national identity, and the human. The book goes on to assess the issues at stake in debates over the "meaning" of Diana, such as the gender politics of cultural icon-making and deconstruction, and conflicting notions of cultural value.	260	June 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/487238.Diana_A_Cultural_History
