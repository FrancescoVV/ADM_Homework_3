The War of Mists	Luthiel's Song #2	Robert Fanney, Matthew R. Friedman	4.23	468	75	She chose to die in her sister's place and yet she lived. Luthiel, just 15 years old, made a brave peace with the dreaded Vyrl of the Vale of Mists. Now she must face an army sent to destroy them. With her companions -- the werewolf Othalas, the dragon Melkion, the sorcerer Mithorden, a Vyrl named Ecthellien, and the elf Vaelros who would love her -- Luthiel races back to the angry faelands to beg forgiveness for monsters. Who, if any, will survive the journey? For the Vale is surrounded by the webs of Widdershae, and the only other path leads to the Red Moon -- where an ancient evil waits in the flames. Beyond the Vale, the home she left is not the same. Armies march for vengeance. Powers play their hands in a game of ages. In the sky something evil stirs. Rumors of a dark prophecy. Whispers of a "Blood Witch." And signs foretelling an ancient doom terrible enough to destroy worlds.	364	December 1st 2008	Luthiel, Othalas, Melkion, Mithorden, Leowin, Zalos, Narhoth, Faehorne, Vaelros, Vanye, Ahmberen, Elshael, Ecthellien, Vane, Merrin, Rendillo, Galwin, Mingole, Thrar Taurmori, Gormtoth, Vlad Valkire, Winowe, Lira, Glendoras, Lorethain, Widdershae, Vyrl, Tuorlin, Oerin, Soelee, Chromnos, Gorthar, Lunen, Silva, Valemar, Yewstaff, Anaturnar, Ithildar, Elohwe, Tiolas, Ottomnos, Sothos, Veolin, Evanya, Evanyar, Elwin, Liel, Gorothoth, Cauthraus, Eavanar, Aehmiel Eversong, Lumen, Eldacar, Cat-o-Fae, Blade Dancer		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6655491-the-war-of-mists
