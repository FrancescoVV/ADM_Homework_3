Incubus Dreams	Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #12	Laurell K. Hamilton	3.79	46853	1036	In the latest New York Times bestselling Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series, Anita's life is more complicated than ever, as she is caught between her obligations to the living and the undead. A vampire serial killer who preys on strippers is on the loose. Called in to consult on the case, Anita fears her judgment may be clouded by a conflict of interest. For she is, after all, the consort of Jean-Claude, the ever-intoxicating Master Vampire of the City. Surrounded by suspicion, overwhelmed by her attempts to control the primal lusts that continue to wrack her, Anita does something unprecedented: she calls for help.	722	2004	Anita Blake, Jean-Claude (Anita Blake series), Richard Zeeman, Malcolm (Anita Blake series), Jason Schuyler, Nathaniel Graison, Damian (Anita Blake series), Micah Callahan, Larry Kirkland, Wicked Truth	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30271.Incubus_Dreams
