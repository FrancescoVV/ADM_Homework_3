Hadassah: One Night with the King	Hadassah #1	Tommy Tenney, Mark Andrew Olsen	4.18	4219	373	Bestselling author Tommy Tenney expands the extraordinary story of Esther like no novelist has done before. Both a thriller and a Jewish woman's memoir, Hadassah takes readers to ancient Persia (now known as Iran), into the inner sanctum of the palace and back out into the war zones of battle and political intrigue. This gripping drama of a simple peasant girl chosen over many more qualified candidates to become Esther, Queen of Persia, captures the imagination and fires the emotions of men and women alike.	351	December 31st 2003	Hadassah, Esther (Bible)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/900379.Hadassah
