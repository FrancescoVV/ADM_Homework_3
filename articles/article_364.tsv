Tuck Everlasting		Natalie Babbitt	3.87	234329	9348	Doomed to - or blessed with - eternal life after drinking from a magic spring, the Tuck family wanders about trying to live as inconspicuously and comfortably as they can. When ten-year-old Winnie Foster stumbles on their secret, the Tucks take her home and explain why living forever at one age is less a blessing that it might seem. Complications arise when Winnie is followed by a stranger who wants to market the spring water for a fortune.	148	1975	Winnie Foster, Angus Bain, Jesse Tuck, Mae Tuck, Miles Tuck		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84981.Tuck_Everlasting
