The Education of Henry Adams		Henry Adams	3.65	3293	343	The Education of Henry Adams records the struggle of Bostonian Henry Adams (1838-1918), in early old age, to come to terms with the dawning 20th century, so different from the world of his youth. It is also a sharp critique of 19th century educational theory and practice. In 1907, Adams began privately circulating copies of a limited edition printed at his own expense. Commercial publication had to await its author's 1918 death, whereupon it won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize.	320	1918	Henry Adams		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12523033-la-educaci-n-de-henry-adams
