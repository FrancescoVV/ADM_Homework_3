Poems and Prose of Mihai Eminescu		Mihai Eminescu, Kurt W. Treptow	4.52	301	3	Published to mark the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Romania's national poet, this edition of the works of Mihai Eminescu contains a selection of the best English-language renditions of poems and prose by this remarkable cultural figure of nineteenth-century Romania. Eminescu (1850-1889) was a complex personality; at once a philosopher, politician, journalist, and prose writer, but above all a poet -- he is 'an expression of the Romanian soul'. The selection in this volume includes English language versions of some of Eminescu's best-known poems and is illustrated with original drawings by the Romanian artist A Bordenache and graphics from the princeps edition of Eminescu's poems published in 1883.	240	May 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/778611.Poems_and_Prose_of_Mihai_Eminescu
