I Crawl Through It		A.S. King	3.52	2782	800	Four talented teenagers are traumatized-coping with grief, surviving date rape, facing the anxiety of standardized tests and the neglect of self-absorbed adults--and they'll do anything to escape the pressure. They'll even build an invisible helicopter, to fly far away to a place where everyone will understand them... until they learn the only way to escape reality is to face it head-on.	336	September 22nd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23203744-i-crawl-through-it
