Rule of the Bone		Russell Banks	3.88	8245	735	In the tradition Huckleberry Finn and The Catcher in the Rye , Russell Banks’s quintessential novel of a disaffected homeless youth living on the edge of society “redefines the young modern anti-hero. . . . Rule of the Bone has its own culture and language, and Bone is sure to become a beloved character for generations” ( San Francisco Chronicle ). With a compelling, off-beat protagonist evocative of Holden Caulfield and Quentin Coldwater, and a narrative voice that masterfully and naturally captures the nuances of a modern vernacular, Banks’s haunting and powerful novel is an indisputable—and unforgettable—modern classic.	390	1995	Chapman Dorset (a.k.a.
