The Queen of Traitors	The Fallen World #2	Laura Thalassa	4.10	8986	594	They say I am a queen. They say I married a monster. That I did so willingly. They say he cannot die, that he does not age. That together, we rule a ravaged world. They say I used to be one of them, but now I am a traitor. They say many things, all which I cannot remember, but … I fear what they say is true. Then there is what they don’t say, what I see in their eyes— The king terrifies them. He cannot be stopped. And, most worrisome of all … He is coming for me.	348	January 13th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23867347-the-queen-of-traitors
