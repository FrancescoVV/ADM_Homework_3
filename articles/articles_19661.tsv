Kim: Empty Inside: The Diary of an Anonymous Teenager		Beatrice Sparks	3.27	761	60	I am so scared. I feel like I'm silently screaming for help and no one pays any attention of tries to hear me. I can't control anything anymore. It's all out to get me! When Kim can't handle things, she eats. Then she purges. Sometimes she fasts. She knows she isn't as thin as the other girls on her gymnastics team, and she's worried that now, away from home for the first time as a college freshman, she won't be able to live up to expectations -- especially her own. Eating is the one thing she can control -- or can she?	165	April 1st 2002		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279639.Kim
