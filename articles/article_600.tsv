We Need to Talk About Kevin		Lionel Shriver	4.05	163535	13900	The gripping international bestseller about motherhood gone awry. Eva never really wanted to be a mother - and certainly not the mother of the unlovable boy who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a much-adored teacher who tried to befriend him, all two days before his sixteenth birthday. Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin's horrific rampage in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails.	400	April 14th 2003	Eva Khatchadourian, Kevin Khatchadourian, Franklin Plaskett, Celia Khatchadourian		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80660.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin
