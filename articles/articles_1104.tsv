White Teeth		Zadie Smith	3.78	124901	7602	At the center of this invigorating novel are two unlikely friends, Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal. Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”). Samad’s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal’s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith. Set against London’s racial and cultural tapestry, venturing across the former empire and into the past as it barrels toward the future, White Teeth revels in the ecstatic hodgepodge of modern life, flirting with disaster, confounding expectations, and embracing the comedy of daily existence.	448	April 1st 2000	Alfred Archibald Jones, Samad Miah Iqbal, Clara Bowden, Alsana Begum, Irie Ambrosia Jones, Millat Zulfikar Iqbal, Hortense Bowden, Mr Topps, Joyce Chalfen, Marcus Chalfen, Magid Iqbal, Joshua Chalfen	Willesden, North London (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3711.White_Teeth
