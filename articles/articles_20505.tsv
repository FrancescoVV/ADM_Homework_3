How My Private, Personal Journal Became a Bestseller		Julia DeVillers	3.62	1118	99	Formerly ordinary fourteen-year-old Jamie Bartlett isn't so ordinary anymore. Ever since she wrote a story about Isabella (aka IS), the stereotype-defying, popular-girl-crushing super teen, Jamie's life hasn't been the same. Suddenly she's doing interviews and book signings, flying to L.A. to hang out with celebrities, and dating Marco Vega, the hottest guy in school! But will all of this attention go to Jamie's head? Or will she take a lesson from IS and remember that there's more to life than popularity?	224	May 11th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202216.How_My_Private_Personal_Journal_Became_a_Bestseller
