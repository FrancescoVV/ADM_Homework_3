The Last Starship from Earth		John      Boyd, Boyd Bradfield Upchurch	3.66	297	49	Haldane IV and Helix were a part of an ultra-rational society where mathematicians did not write poetry, where mathematicians did not fall in love with poets, and where most specifically, Haldane IV, young mathematician, couldn't possibly marry Helix, the attractive poet of his choice. It was in the best interests of the human race, said the State, that mates be selected for all professional people according to strict scientific principles.	182	January 1st 1967			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/872518.The_Last_Starship_from_Earth
