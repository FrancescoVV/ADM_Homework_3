Touching the Void: The True Story of One Man's Miraculous Survival		Joe Simpson	4.22	49732	1779	Touching the Void is the heart-stopping account of Joe Simpson's terrifying adventure in the Peruvian Andes. He and his climbing partner, Simon, reached the summit of the remote Siula Grande in June 1985. A few days later, Simon staggered into Base Camp, exhausted and frost-bitten, with news that that Joe was dead. What happened to Joe, and how the pair dealt with the psychological traumas that resulted when Simon was forced into the appalling decision to cut the rope, makes not only an epic of survival but a compelling testament of friendship.	218	1988	Joe Simpson & Simon Yates		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18600.Touching_the_Void
