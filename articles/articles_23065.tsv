White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism		Robin DiAngelo, Michael Eric Dyson	4.29	98440	13546	The New York Times best-selling book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when their assumptions about race are challenged, and how these reactions maintain racial inequality. Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, anti-racist educator Robin DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what can be done to engage more constructively.	169	June 26th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43708708-white-fragility
