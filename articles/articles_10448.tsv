The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee		Sarah Silverman	3.53	36209	2187	From the outrageously filthy and oddly innocent comedienne Sarah Silverman comes a memoir—her first book—that is at once shockingly personal, surprisingly poignant, and still pee-in-your-pants funny. If you like Sarah’s television show The Sarah Silverman Program, or memoirs such as Chelsea Handler’s Are You There Vodka? It’s Me Chelsea and Artie Lange’s Too Fat to Fish, you’ll love The Bedwetter.	240	April 10th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7897478-the-bedwetter
