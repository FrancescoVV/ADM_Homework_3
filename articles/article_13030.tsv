The End of Alice		A.M. Homes	3.60	6880	853	From the 2013 Orange Prize-winning author of May We Be Forgiven Only a work of such searing, meticulously controlled brilliance could provoke such a wide range of visceral responses. Here is the incredible story of an imprisoned pedophile who is drawn into an erotically charged correspondence with a nineteen-year-old suburban coed. As the two reveal—and revel in—their obsessive desires, Homes creates in The End of Alice a novel that is part romance, part horror story, at once unnerving and seductive.	272	1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75479.The_End_of_Alice
