The Cheese and I: An Englishman's Voyage Through the Land of Fromage		Matt Feroze	3.85	68	9	Matt Feroze had a rather unusual dream: to become a cheesemonger in the highly competitive French cheese industry. To accomplish this, however, he would have to make huge sacrifices: give up a good job as an accountant in England and say goodbye to his friends and family, moving to a country in which he struggled with the language and knew next to nothing about the profession he wished to enter. Yet only a year later he was being crowned Champion de France des Fromagers, beating veteran French cheesemongers to the title and opening up a wealth of new opportunities for himself. The Cheese and I is the remarkable story of how he pulled off such an incredible feat. This is the inspirational tale of how an Englishman sacrificed so much to pursue and realize his goal, and proves that, with enough determination, it is possible to achieve anything you desire.	224	September 5th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18595546-the-cheese-and-i
