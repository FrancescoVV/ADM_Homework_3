And although her renowned Riddle-Master trilogy-- The Riddle-Master of Hed, Heir of Sea and Fire , and Harpist in the Wind --has been long out of print, it is considered her most enduring and beloved work. Now it is collected in one volume for the first time--the epic journeys of a young prince in a strange land, where wizards have long since vanished...but where magic is waiting to be reborn.	578	1976	Morgon, Prince of Hed, Raederle of An, Deth, Eliard of Hed, Tristan of Hed, Mathom of An, Duac of An, Rood of An, Heureu of Ymris, Eriel, Astrin of Ymris, The Morgol, Lyra of Herun, Har the Wolf-King, Danan of Isig, Ghisteslwchlohm, Yrth, Aloil, Nun, Iff of the Unpronounceable Name, Suth, Talies, Ohm, Tel		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19821.Riddle_Master
