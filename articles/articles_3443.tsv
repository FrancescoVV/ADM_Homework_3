The A.B.C. Murders	Hercule Poirot #13	Agatha Christie	4.02	99881	5017	When Alice Asher is murdered in Andover, Hercule Poirot is already looking into the clues. Alphabetically speaking, it's one letter down, twenty-five to go. There's a serial killer on the loose. His macabre calling card is to leave the ABC Railway Guide beside each victim's body. But if A is for Alice Asher, bludgeoned to death in Andover, and B is for Betty Bernard, strangled with her belt on the beach at Bexhill, who will then be Victim C? Considered to be one of Agatha Christie's best.	232	January 6th 1936	Inspector Japp, Arthur Hastings, Hercule Poirot, Alice Ascher, Franz Ascher, Mary Drower, Megan Barnard, Donald Fraser, Millie Higley, Franklin Clarke, Charlotte Clarke, Thora Grey, Roger Downes, George Earlsfield, Alexander Bonaparte Cust, Inspector Chrome, Strange (The A.B.C.
