Gods and Generals	The Civil War Trilogy #1	Jeff Shaara	4.08	32361	793	In a prequel of sorts to his father Michael Shaara's 1974 epic novel The Killer Angels , Jeff Shaara explores the lives of Generals Lee, Hancock, Jackson and Chamberlain as the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg approaches. Shaara captures the disillusionment of both Lee and Hancock early in their careers, Lee's conflict with loyalty, Jackson's overwhelming Christian ethic and Chamberlain's total lack of experience, while illustrating how each compensated for shortcomings and failures when put to the test. The perspectives of the four men, particularly concerning the battles at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, make vivid the realities of war.	498	May 28th 1996		Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29925.Gods_and_Generals
