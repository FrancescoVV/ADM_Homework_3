Small Lives		Pierre Michon, Jody Gladding, Elizabeth Deshays	3.87	445	58	Explores the act of writing through the intimate portraits of eight interconnected individuals in the author's native village of Creuse. In this evocative poetic narrative the quest to breathe life into the stories of these individuals becomes an exploration of the author's own voice. Michon does not deny the autobiographical nature of this haunting and seminal work, which only serves to heighten and empower the writing.	215	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3006702-small-lives
