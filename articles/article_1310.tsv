Wolf Hall	Thomas Cromwell #1	Hilary Mantel	3.87	167859	15790	England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?	604	April 30th 2009	Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour, Mary Boleyn, Thomas Howard, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Thomas Wyatt, Hans Holbein the Younger, Francis I of France, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer, Walter Cromwell, Morgan Williams, Elizabeth Wykys, Henry Wykys, Johane Williamson, John Williamson, Alice Wellyfed, Bet Cromwell, Rafe Sadler, Thomas Avery, Helen Barre, Dick Purser, Thomas Wolsey, George Cavendish, Stephen Gardiner, Katherine Cromwell, Thomas Boleyn, Henry VIII of England, George Boleyn, Jane Boleyn, Richard Riche, Mary I of England	Putney (United Kingdom), Dover, Kent, England (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom), England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7826803-wolf-hall
