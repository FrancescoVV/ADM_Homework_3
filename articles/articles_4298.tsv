Ilium	Ilium #1	Dan Simmons	4.03	26064	1139	The Trojan War rages at the foot of Olympos Mons on Mars—observed and influenced from on high by Zeus and his immortal family—and twenty-first-century professor Thomas Hockenberry is there to play a role in the insidious private wars of vengeful gods and goddesses. On Earth, a small band of the few remaining humans pursues a lost past and devastating truth—as four sentient machines depart from Jovian space to investigate, perhaps terminate, the potentially catastrophic emissions emanating from a mountaintop miles above the terraformed surface of the Red Planet.	752	2003	Odysseus, Hector of Troy, Achilles (Greek hero), Hockenberry, Mahnmut, Orphu		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3973.Ilium
