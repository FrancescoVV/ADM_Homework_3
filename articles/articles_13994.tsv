Night Broken	Mercy Thompson #8	Patricia Briggs	4.42	53333	3613	An unexpected phone call heralds a new challenge for Mercy. Her mate Adam’s ex-wife is in trouble, on the run from a stalker. Adam isn’t the kind of man to turn away a person in need—and Mercy knows it. But with Christy holed up in Adam’s house, Mercy can’t shake the feeling that something about the situation isn’t right. Soon her suspicions are confirmed when she learns that Christy has the furthest thing from good intentions. She wants Adam back, and she’s willing to do whatever it takes to get him, including turning Adam’s pack against Mercy. Mercy isn’t about to step down without a fight, but there’s a more dangerous threat circling. Christy’s stalker is more than a bad man—in fact, he may not be human at all. As the bodies start piling up, Mercy must put her personal troubles aside to face a creature with the power to tear her whole world apart.	341	March 4th 2014	Adam Hauptman, Mercy Thompson, Honey Jorgenson, Coyote (Mercy Thompson), Christy Hauptman, Guayota, volcano god, Gary Laughingdog	Tri-Cities, Washington (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17562900-night-broken
