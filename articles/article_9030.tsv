The Dark God's Bride	The Dark God's Bride #1	Dahlia Lu, Dahlia L. Summers	3.65	1340	83	An ancient god on a destructive path of vengeance... Imprisoned by the Archangel Lucifer ages ago, Summit, the Dark God, wanted nothing less than equivalent retribution. After breaking free and successfully retaining some splintered shards of his sanity, Summit set out to confront Lucifer. The Archangel was nowhere to be found. He has, however, left behind his most coveted mortal bride. The Dark God stormed into Hell to capture Lucifer's one and only weakness, but inadvertently abducted the wrong female - his own. A reluctant heroine... As a mortal raised among the demons inside a floating castle in Hell, Amara's life is not exactly what you would call normal. When she finds herself abducted by a half-mad god, who mistook her for the woman who brought her up, Amara chooses to hide her identity to protect her foster mother at the risk of her own life.	187	July 19th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13647958-the-dark-god-s-bride
