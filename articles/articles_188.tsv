The Maze Runner	The Maze Runner #1	James Dashner	4.03	1063631	55864	If you ain’t scared, you ain’t human. When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers—boys whose memories are also gone. Nice to meet ya, shank. Welcome to the Glade. Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It’s the only way out—and no one’s ever made it through alive. Everything is going to change. Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying. Remember. Survive. Run.	384	October 6th 2009	Chuck, Teresa Agnes, Minho, Alby, Gally, Thomas, Ben, Newt		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6186357-the-maze-runner
