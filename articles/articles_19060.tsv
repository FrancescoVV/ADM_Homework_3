The Hill of Dreams		Arthur Machen	3.89	899	113	Lucian Taylor is damned, either through contact with an erotically pagan faerie world or through something degenerate in his own nature. He thinks of the damning thing inside him as a faun. He becomes a writer, and when he moves to London he becomes trapped by the increasing reality of the dark imaginings of this creature within him, which become increasingly real. The portrait of a doomed artist: a man not unlike Machen himself.	204	1907	Lucian Taylor	Caermaen, Wales (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/310584.The_Hill_of_Dreams
