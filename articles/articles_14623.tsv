About the Author		John Colapinto	3.83	1069	153	Just how did Cal Cunningham—a twenty-five-year-old bookstore stockboy who is new to Manhattan and who has never written anything—publish a bestselling novel that sells to the movies for a million dollars? A mysterious roommate, a timely bike accident, and the rapacious literary agent Blackie Yaeger all play a role in Cal's success. Deception, blackmail, and murder all play a role in his desperate bid to hold on to it. And About the Author is his first-person account of how he performed this remarkable feat.	254	July 31st 2001	Cal Cunningham	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/267419.About_the_Author
