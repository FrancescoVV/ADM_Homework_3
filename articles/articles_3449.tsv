Haunted	Otherworld #5	Kelley Armstrong	4.08	25391	858	The afterlife isn’t all it’s cracked up to be… Former supernatural superpower Eve Levine has broken all the rules. But she’s never broken a promise—not even during the three years she’s spent in the afterworld. So when the Fates call in a debt she gave her word she’d pay, she has no choice but to comply. For centuries one of the ghost world’s wickedest creatures has been loosed on humanity, thwarting every attempt to retrieve her. Now it has fallen to Eve to capture this demi-demon known as the Nix, who inhabits the bodies of would-be killers, compelling them to complete their deadly acts. It’s a mission that becomes all too personal when the Nix targets those Eve loves most—including Savannah, the daughter she left on earth. But can a renegade witch succeed where a host of angels have failed?	495	May 31st 2005	Jaime Vegas, Eve Levine, Savannah Levine, Paige Winterbourne, Lucas Cortez, Kristof Nast, Daniel Santos, Trsiel		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11919.Haunted
