The Best Short Stories		J.G. Ballard, Anthony Burgess	4.20	1508	98	First published in 1978, this collection of nineteen of Ballard's best short stories is as timely and informed as ever. His tales of the human psyche and its relationship to nature and technology, as viewed through a strong microscope, were eerily prescient and now provide greater perspective on our computer-dominated culture. Ballard's voice and vision have long served as a font of inspiration for today's cyber-punks, the authors and futurist who brought the information age into the mainstream.	302	1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70239.The_Best_Short_Stories
