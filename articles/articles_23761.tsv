My Boyfriends' Dogs: The Tales of Adam and Eve and Shirley		Dandi Daley Mackall	3.84	506	76	If only boys were more like dogs. On a stormy night in St. Louis, Bailey Daley finds refuge in an after-hours diner. Bailey, a girl with three dogs in tow, wearing a soaking-wet prom dress, obviously has a story to tell. See, she wants what every girl wants from her boyfriend: enthusiasm, loyalty, and unconditional love. And Bailey is always falling in love - with boys, and with their dogs. And each of her dogs came from a relationship that didn't quite work out. But don't worry: in this fun, clean romance, true love is never far away - it just waits until you stop looking for it.	265	January 12th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6609745-my-boyfriends-dogs
