Swamplandia!		Karen Russell	3.27	53807	7769	The Bigtree alligator wrestling dynasty is in decline—think Buddenbrooks set in the Florida Everglades—and Swamplandia!, their island home and gator-wrestling theme park, is swiftly being encroached upon by a sophisticated competitor known as the "World of Darkness." Ava, a resourceful but terrified twelve-year-old, must manage seventy gators and the vast, inscrutable landscape of her own grief. Her mother, Swamplandia!’s legendary headliner, has just died; her sister is having an affair with a ghost called the Dredgeman; her brother has secretly defected to the World of Darkness in a last-ditch effort to keep their sinking family afloat; and her father, Chief Bigtree, is AWOL. To save her family, Ava must journey on her own to a perilous part of the swamp called the "Underworld," a harrowing odyssey from which she emerges a true heroine.	418	February 1st 2011	Ava Bigtree, The Bird Man, Osceola Bigtree, Kiwi Bigtree, Hilola Bigtree, Sam (Chief) Bigtree, Louis Thanksgiving Auschenbliss	Everglades, Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940157-swamplandia
