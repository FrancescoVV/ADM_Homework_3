In the Tall Grass		Stephen King, Joe Hill, Stephen Lang	3.66	19499	2086	Mile 81 meets N. in this e-book collaboration between Stephen King and Joe Hill. In the Tall Grass begins with a sister and brother who pull off to the side of the road after hearing a young boy crying for help from beyond the tall grass. Within minutes they are disoriented, in deeper than seems possible, and they’ve lost one another. The boy’s cries are more and more desperate. What follows is a terrifying, entertaining, and masterfully told tale, as only Stephen King and Joe Hill can deliver. In the Tall Grass was originally published in two parts in the June/July and August 2012 issues of Esquire magazine. This is their second collaboration since the novella Throttle , published in 2009.	2	October 9th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15825932-in-the-tall-grass
