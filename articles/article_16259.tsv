The odd group of dimension travelers arrives in a country full of magic seeking a book that may hold the key to finding one of Princess Sakura's powerful memory feathers. But the volume they need turns out to be a national treasure, off limits to the public. Now Syaoran, Kurogane, and the others must brave traps, ravenous beasts, and some of the universe's strongest magicians in order to steal the book.
