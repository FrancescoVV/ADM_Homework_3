The Neon Rain	Dave Robicheaux #1	James Lee Burke	3.94	21182	1249	Detective Dave Robicheaux has fought too many battles: in Vietnam, with killers and hustlers, with police brass, and with the bottle. Lost without his wife's love, Robicheaux's haunted soul mirrors the intensity and dusky mystery of New Orleans' French Quarter -- the place he calls home, and the place that nearly destroys him when he becomes involved in the case of a young prostitute whose body is found in a bayou. Thrust into the world of drug lords and arms smugglers, Robicheaux must face down a subterranean criminal world and come to terms with his own bruised heart in order to survive.	285	1987	Dave Robicheaux	New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55022.The_Neon_Rain
