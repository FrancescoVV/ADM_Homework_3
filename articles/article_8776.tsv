City of Flowers	Stravaganza #3	Mary Hoffman	3.99	6048	147	Sky stepped out into the sunshine, blinking, still holding the bottle, and a black man, robed like the others, took him by the arm and whispered, 'God be praised, it has found you!' Everything changes for Sky when he finds a perfume bottle that whiskes him away to the city of Giglia, an ancient city similar to Florence. This may be the beautiful City of Flowers, but things that seems beautiful might also be deadly. As a new Stravagante - someone who can travel through space and time with the help of a talisman - Sky finds himself caught up in a deadly feud between Giglia's two ruling families. Now, the Stravaganti must do all they can to avoid further bloodshed as politics, conspiracy and espionage unfold.	489	2005	Sky Meadows, Rosalind Meadows, Luciano Crinamorte, Georgia O'Grady, Brother Sulien, Sandro, Giuditta Miele, Alice Greaves, Rainbow Warrior, Duke Niccolo di Chimici, Arianna Rossi, Rodolfo Rossi, Silvia Bellini, Guido Parola, Francesca di Chimici, Gaetano di Chimici, Nicholas Duke, Carlo di Chimici, Enrico Poggi, Beatrice di Chimici	Devon, England, London, England (United Kingdom), Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295107.City_of_Flowers
