I Like It Like That	Gossip Girl #5	Cecily von Ziegesar	3.58	13434	291	Welcome to New York City's Upper East Side, where a week off from school means wild parties, new alliances, and clues to some truly outrageous mysteries. Enter the world of Gossip Girl - and watch us drown in luxury while indulging in our favorite sports - jealousy, betrayal, and late-night bar-hopping. Spring Break is here and it's time for S & B to jet out to Sun Valley for plenty of apr√®s-ski hot tub fun. Too bad for those unfortunate few who have to stay in New York and intern among the city's most fabulous glitterati. Back on the slopes, when the ski house is this big, who can keep track of N, and who's sleeping where? So get out your cashmere-lined boots and meet me by the fire! You know you love me, gossip girl	202	May 5th 2004	Serena van der Woodsen, Blair Waldorf, Nate Archibald, Charles "Chuck" Bass, Dan Humphrey, Jenny Humphrey, Vanessa Abrams		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47924.I_Like_It_Like_That
