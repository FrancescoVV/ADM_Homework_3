The Time of Our Singing		Richard Powers	4.25	2816	394	From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Overstory , an enthralling, wrenching novel about the lives and choices of one family, caught on the cusp of identities. Jonah, Ruth and Joseph are the children of mixed-race parents determined to raise them beyond time, beyond identity, steeped in song. Yet they cannot be protected from the world forever. Even as Jonah becomes a successful young tenor, the opera arena remains fixated on his race. Ruth turns her back on classical music and disappears, dedicating herself to activism and a new relationship. As the years pass, Joseph – the middle child, a pianist and our narrator – must battle not just to remain connected to his siblings, but to forge a future of his own. This is a story of the tragedy of race in America, told through the lives and choices of one family caught on the cusp of identities. ‘An epic novel of modern America that weaves ideas of race, music and science into a mysterious but satisfying tapestry... Endlessly fascinating’ Independent	631	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23007.The_Time_of_Our_Singing
