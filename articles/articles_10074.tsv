Croak	Croak #1	Gina Damico	3.92	10734	1501	Fed up with her wild behavior, sixteen-year-old Lex's parents ship her off to upstate New York to live with her Uncle Mort for the summer, hoping that a few months of dirty farm work will whip her back into shape. But Uncle Mort's true occupation is much dirtier than shoveling manure. He's a Grim Reaper. And he's going to teach Lex the family business. She quickly assimilates into the peculiar world of Croak, a town populated by reapers who deliver souls from this life to the next. But Lex can't stop her desire for justice — or is it vengeance? — whenever she encounters a murder victim, craving to stop the attackers before they can strike again. Will she ditch Croak and go rogue with her reaper skills?	311	March 20th 2012	Edgar Allan Poe, Lex Bartleby, Uncle Mort, Zara, Driggs, Elysia, Ferbus		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11836538-croak
