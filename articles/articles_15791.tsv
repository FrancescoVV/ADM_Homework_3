Bearing an Hourglass	Incarnations of Immortality #2	Piers Anthony	3.96	21671	477	THE MAN WHO LIVED BACKWARD When life seemed pointless to Norton, he accepted the position as the Incarnation of Time, even though it meant living backward from present to past. The other seemingly all-powerful incantations of Immortality—Death, Fate, War, and Nature—made him welcome. Even Satan greeted him with gifts. But he soon discovered that the gifts were cunning traps and he had become enmeshed in a complex scheme of the Evil One to destroy all that was good. In the end, armed only with the Hourglass, Norton was forced to confront the immense power of Satan directly. And though Satan banished him to Hell, he was resolved to fight on.	372	July 12th 1984	Parry, Orlene, Norton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76659.Bearing_an_Hourglass
