Batman: NoÃ«l	Batman	Lee Bermejo, Jim Lee	4.05	7188	468	#1 NEW YORK TIMES Bestseller Inspired by Charles Dickens' immortal classic A Christmas Carol, BATMAN: NOEL features different interpretations of The Dark Knight, along with his enemies and allies, in different eras. Along the way, Batman must come to terms with his past, present and future as he battles villains from the campy 1960s to dark and brooding menaces of today, while exploring what it means to be the hero that he is. Members of Batman's supporting cast enact roles analogous to those from A Christmas Carol, with Robin, Catwoman, Superman, The Joker and more playing roles that will be familiar to anyone who knows Dickens' original holiday tale.	112	November 2nd 2011	Alfred Pennyworth, Jason Todd, James Gordon, Selina Kyle, Bruce Wayne, Joker, Superman	Gotham City (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11186443-batman
