Elegy	Watersong #4	Amanda Hocking	4.01	7389	598	An ancient curse robbed Gemma Fisher of everything that matters most—her friends, her family and the guy she loves. But now that she found the scroll that binds the curse, she finally has a chance to get her old life back. She just needs to destroy the scroll—but it's not as easy as she hoped. Protected by ancient magic, it seems utterly indestructible. Making matters worse, Penn has grown even more obsessed with stealing Daniel for her own…and she's about to succeed. Gemma's frantic search leads her to someone who might be able to help—the mysterious immortal who cursed Penn and her sisters thousands of years ago. As Gemma and her friends unravel the tragic history of the curse, they plunge deeper into a world of shocking secrets and twisted vendettas—and it'll take all their courage, love and the power of their friendship just to survive. Gemma has so much to fight for and she's never wanted anything more, but will it be enough to stop her enemies?	542	January 1st 2013	John Morgan, Adam Crawford, Lydia Panning, Aglaope, Kirby Logan, Bernie McAllister, Jason Way, Alex Lane, Tom Wagner, Thea Triton, Ligea, Aiden Crawford		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615701-elegy
