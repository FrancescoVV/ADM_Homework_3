Providence	Providence #1	Jamie McGuire, Frauke Meier	3.98	26673	1881	Struggling with her father's death, Nina meets Jared Ryel, presumably by chance. However it soon becomes clear that he knows more about her than even close friends. When her father's former associates begin following her in the dark, Nina learns that her father was not the man she thought he was, but a thief who stole from demons. In searching for the truth behind her father's death, she stumbles upon something she never expected, and something Hell wants, that only she holds the key for. Jared risks everything to keep the women he was born to save, by sharing the secret he was sworn to protect.	360	2010		Providence, Rhode Island (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9712492-providence
