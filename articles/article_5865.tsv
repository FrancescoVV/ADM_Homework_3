The Fire	Witch & Wizard #3	James Patterson, Jill Dembowski, Elijah Wood, Spencer Locke	3.86	18022	902	Whit and Wisty Allgood have sacrificed everything to lead the resistance against the merciless totalitarian regime that governs their world. Its supreme leader, The One Who Is The One, has banned everything they hold dear: books, music, art, and imagination. But the growing strength of the siblings' magic hasn't been enough to stop the One's evil rampage, and now he's executed the only family they had left. Wisty knows that the time has finally come for her to face The One. But her fight and her fire only channel more power to this already invincible being. How can she and Whit possibly prepare for their imminent showdown with the ruthless villain that devastated their world-before he can truly become all-powerful? In this stunning climax of the epic Witch & Wizard series, the stakes have never been higher-and the consequences will change everything.	352	2011	Sasha, Byron Swain, Janine, Wisteria Allgood, Whitford Allgood, Mrs. Highsmith, Jamilla, Feffer, Pearl Marie, Mama May, Emmet, Pearce, The One Who Is The One, Eliza Allgood, Benjamin Allgood		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10778410-the-fire
