Nothing Can Keep Us Together	Gossip Girl #8	Cecily von Ziegesar	3.64	10175	193	Welcome to New York City's Upper East Side, where my friends and I are the princes and princesses of private school, and graduation is just an excuse to throw a fabulous party - as if we need a reason. Enter the world of Gossip Girl- a world where jealousy and betrayal are always in fashion. We're nearly done with high school - forever! - but before we head off to the Ivy of our choice we've got plenty to keep us busy: B found S kissing N in the shower. Steamy! Even B can see that S and N would make the hottest couple ever, right? Wrong. B's about to strut down the revenge runway, and I have a front row seat. We'll see if this catfight looks good on the catwalk. Time to hide behind my oversized Chanel sunglasses to watch the show . . . . You know you love me, gossip girl	221	May 2005	Serena van der Woodsen, Blair Waldorf, Nate Archibald, Charles "Chuck" Bass, Dan Humphrey, Jenny Humphrey, Vanessa Abrams		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22189.Nothing_Can_Keep_Us_Together
