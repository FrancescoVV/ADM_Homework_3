Gus	Bright Side #2	Kim Holden	4.46	13006	1845	The journey that began in top-rated, best-selling Bright Side, continues ... This is the story of Gus. Losing himself. Finding himself. And healing along the way. “ … but the honest-to-God truth is I don’t even know how to function anymore. Bright Side wasn’t only my best friend; she was like my other half ... the other half of my brain, the other half of my conscience, the other half of my sense of humor, the other half of my creativity, the other half of my heart. How do you go back to doing what you did before, when half of you is gone forever?”	389	May 19th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23389993-gus
