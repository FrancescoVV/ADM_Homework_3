I Am Beauty-Full just for Being Me		Tanya Curtis, Desiree Delaloye	4.83	18	10	A Beauty-Full Book with a Beauty-Full Message. A powerful message for children to learn early in life that nothing we do, nor the way we look determines our beauty as our TRUE BEAUTY was already there at our birth and will be in us forever, no matter what our life challenges are. Our true beauty comes from our innermost and is not based on what the world judges. This message shared will support children of all ages, colour and origin (including all adults) to accept themselves just for BEING them.	32	July 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158936-i-am-beauty-full-just-for-being-me
