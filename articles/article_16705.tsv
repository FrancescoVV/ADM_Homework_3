Three Soldiers		John Dos Passos	3.58	1073	121	A searing novel exposing the fate of the common soldier during World War I. Driven by the idealism that infected many young Americans at the time (including Ernest Hemingway), author John Dos Passos joined the Ambulance Corps. His rapid and profound disillusionment forms the core of this fierce denouncement of the military and of the far-reaching social implications of its exploitation of young men. 400 pp.	362	1921			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7105.Three_Soldiers
