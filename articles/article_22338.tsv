Beautiful Things and How to Ignore Them		Sam Kuban	3.75	16	3	This collection of poems details the demise of thirteen townspeople, all of whom are as unpleasant and undesirable as the death through which they suffer. If you are loving, hopeful, calm, and happy, and are looking for a read that will reflect any one of those qualities, then this book is most definitely not for you. Continue your browse. However, if you find it soothing to laugh at the misfortune, embarrassment, and humiliation of others, and if you chuckle at the thought of unjustified death, then this book might put a smirk on your cheek.	57	April 29th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22031476-beautiful-things-and-how-to-ignore-them
