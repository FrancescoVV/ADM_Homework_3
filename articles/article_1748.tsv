Seduced in the Dark	The Dark Duet #2	C.J. Roberts	4.29	53418	4164	BOOK TWO OF THE DARK DUET The exciting, titillating, and action-filled conclusion to Captive in the Dark. What is the price of redemption? Rescued from sexual slavery by a mysterious Pakistani officer, Caleb carries the weight of a debt that must be paid in blood. The road has been long and fraught with uncertainty, but for Caleb and Livvie, itâ€™s all coming to an end. Can he surrender the woman he loves for the sake of vengeance? Or will he make the ultimate sacrifice? Quote: It seemed to Caleb, the nature of human beings revolved around one empirical truth: we want what we cannot have. For Eve, it was the fruit of the forbidden tree. For Caleb, it was Livvie.	505	August 30th 2012	Muhammad Rafiq, Matthew Reed, Olivia Ruiz, Felipe Villanueva, Janice Sloan, Caleb (Captive in the Dark)	Mexico	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13612739-seduced-in-the-dark
