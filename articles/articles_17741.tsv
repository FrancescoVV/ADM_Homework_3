The Sweetest Thing		Christina Mandelski	3.61	948	211	In the world of Sheridan Wells, life is perfect when she’s decorating a cake. Unfortunately, everything else is a complete mess: her mom ran off years ago, her dad is more interested in his restaurant, and the idea of a boyfriend is laughable. But Sheridan is convinced finding her mom will solve all her problems—only her dad’s about to get a cooking show in New York, which means her dream of a perfect family will be dashed.	336	January 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8887183-the-sweetest-thing
