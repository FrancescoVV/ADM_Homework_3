Her fingerprints, however, are everywhere. When she asks her sister, attorney Sarah, to mount her defense, Sarah in turn brings in psychiatrist Justin Donnelly. Kidnapped at the age of four and victimized for two years, Laurie has developed astounding coping skills. Only when the unbearable memories of those lost years are released can the truth of the crime come outâ€”and only then can the final sadistic plan of her abductor, whose obsession is stronger than ever, be revealed.	352	June 1st 1989	Laura Kenyon, Sarah Kenyon, Justin Donnelly		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170619.All_Around_the_Town
