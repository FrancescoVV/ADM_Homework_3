The Intelligent Universe: AI, ET, and the Emerging Mind of the Cosmos		James N. Gardner, Ray Kurzweil	4.04	83	11	What is the ultimate destiny of our universe? That is the striking question addressed by James Gardner in The Intelligent Universe . Traditionally, scientists (and Robert Frost) have offered two bleak answers to this profound issue: fire or ice.
