Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul		John Eldredge	3.92	68318	2078	God designed men to be dangerous, says John Eldredge. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a "nice guy." It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous, passionate, alive, and free!	256	April 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40881942-wild-at-heart-revised-and-updated
