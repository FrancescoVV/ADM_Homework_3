Hunting Fear	Bishop/Special Crimes Unit #7	Kay Hooper	4.23	9143	222	Lucas Jordan has an extraordinary psychic skill that police all over the country find invaluable: he locates missing people. And since being recruited by Noah Bishop for his FBI Special Crimes Unit, Lucas has learned to hone his remarkable ability so that what he does seems little short of miraculous. He's called in on what appear to be a series of ordinary kidnappings-for-ransom, but almost immediately Lucas realizes the situation is far from ordinary -- and more deadly than anything he's ever faced before. Because a brilliant, twisted madman is out to win a sick game, matching his wits against the best hunter he can find: Lucas.	350	August 17th 2004		North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194003.Hunting_Fear
