Inspirations from Heaven's Gate		Lisa C.  Miller	5.00	3	2	I feel that I have been inspired to write this book with the help of the whispered power of the Holy Spirit. I want to help the broken and lost souls of humanity find their way and help them become stronger in their life. I feel the easiest way for me to do this is through the written word because words have power that can change a person for the better. This is a book of poetry with bible verses sprinkled throughout. May God bless your life through the reading of this book.	98	April 22nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17854353-inspirations-from-heaven-s-gate
