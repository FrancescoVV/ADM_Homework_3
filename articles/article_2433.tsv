Midnight Exposure	Midnight #1	Melinda Leigh	4.14	20432	558	The first suspenseful thriller in the Midnight series from Wall Street Journal bestselling author Melinda Leigh. Point, click, die. When two hikers disappear, their hometown in Maine blames the blinding storms. But the truth is far more sinister. Unaware of the danger, tabloid photographer Jayne Sullivan follows an anonymous tip to find the most reclusive sculptor in the art world. Instead, she finds sexy handyman Reed Kimball—and a small town full of fatal secrets. Five years ago, Reed buried his homicide detective career along with his wife. But when a hiker is found dead, the local police chief asks Reed for help. Why was a Celtic coin found under the body? And where is the second hiker? Avoiding the media, Reed doesn’t need a murder, a missing person, or a nosey photographer. Then Jayne is attacked, and her courage is his undoing. Reed must risk everything to protect her - and find a cunning killer.	315	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32864276-midnight-exposure
