Go Ask Alice		Beatrice Sparks, Anonymous	3.76	235433	10694	It started when she was served a soft drink laced with LSD in a dangerous party game. Within months, she was hooked, trapped in a downward spiral that took her from her comfortable home and loving family to the mean streets of an unforgiving city. It was a journey that would rob her of her innocence, her youth -- and ultimately her life. Read her diary. Enter her world. You will never forget her.	213	1971		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46799.Go_Ask_Alice
