Goa : A Lesson In Life		Adam Harkus	2.95	22	1	Back in August 2006 I visited Goa, India. A trip that affected my outlook on life, views on my country and my attitude towards others of all backgrounds. In 2015, I finally decided to put down in writing all the experiences encountered on my journey, not least my admiration for India, it’s people and it’s culture.	79	January 18th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33973209-goa
