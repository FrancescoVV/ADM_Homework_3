Reborn Yesterday	Phenomenal Fate #1	Tessa Bailey	3.73	3035	648	A timeless love story with bite. It was a night like any other for funeral home director Ginny Lynn, until the exceptionally handsome—and unfortunately deceased—young man on her embalming table sat up, opened his emerald eyes and changed the course of her life forever, making her feel quite fluttery while he was at it. Humans aren't supposed to know Jonas Cantrell, or any vampire, exists. It's kind of a major rule. Despite his instantaneous bond with perfectly peculiar Ginny, he has no choice but to erase her memories of their one and only meeting. That was the plan. Before a reluctant Jonas can wipe Ginny's mind clean, she reveals a secret that brings their worlds crashing together. Human and vampire. Past and present. Darkness and light. And while their love is strictly forbidden, it might be the only thing that can save them… Reborn Yesterday is a standalone paranormal romantic comedy with a happily ever after.	382	March 16th 2020	Ginny Lynn, Jonas Cantrell	Coney Island, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50609790-reborn-yesterday
