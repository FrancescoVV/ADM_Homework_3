xxxHolic, Vol. 7	xxxHOLiC #7	CLAMP, William Flanagan	4.33	2444	44	KimihIro Watanuki has a wish on layaway with Yûko Ishikawa, the sultry time-space witch who can grant anyone’s deepest desire… for a price! Still, working like a slave in Yûko’s shop hasn’t dampened Kimihiro’s enthusiasm for his cute classmate Himawari-chan, nor his irritation with his too-cool rival Dômeki, the guy who always seems to be around during Kimihiro’s most embarrassing moments. But when Dômeki, trying to be a good samaritan, inadvertently becomes the object of a terrible grudge, Kimihiro seeks Yûko’s help. However, the cost for her assistance is steep: Kimihiro would be permanently impaired! Is such a sacrifice worth it for someone he would rather have disappear? Includes chapters 43–47.	192	October 17th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228068.xxxHolic_Vol_7
