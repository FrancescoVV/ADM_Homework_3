A Discovery of Witches	All Souls Trilogy #1	Deborah Harkness	4.00	372739	35514	A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together. Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the Twilight series-with an extra serving of historical realism.	579	February 2011	Sarah Bishop, Sean Ryder, Diana Bishop, Matthew Clairmont, Emily Mather, Miriam Shephard, Hamish Osborne, Marcus Whitmore, Ysabeau de Clermont, Baldwin de Clairmont, Elias Ashmole, Peter Knox, Stephen Proctor, Rebecca Bishop, Juliette Durand, Agatha Wilson, Nathaniel Wilson, Gillian Chamberlain, Marthe (Vampire), Chris Roberts	Oxford, England, Saint Lucien (France), Madison, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8667848-a-discovery-of-witches
