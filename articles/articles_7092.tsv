Fear Me	Broken Love #1	B.B. Reid	3.96	19497	1941	I don't believe in fairy tales and Prince Charming. I believe in fear. He taught me how to be afraid. We first met on a playground on a wonderful summer day. It was the first time he hurt me and it wouldnâ€™t be the last. For ten years, he's been my tormentor and I've been his forbidden. But then he went away, and yet I was still afraid. Now he's back and wants more than just my tears. You see...he thinks I sent him away so now he wants revenge...and he knows just how to get it.
