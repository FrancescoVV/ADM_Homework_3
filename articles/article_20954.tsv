The Memory of Lost Dreams		Davon M. Custis	3.52	52	43	Malik Soules has never seen such an amazing sight. There lay the city of Imperia: gutted, destroyed, cracked with broken windows, every skyscraper went slanted within this deep underground cavern. What happened to this place so long ago? He accidentally stumbles upon a machine called REQUIEM. By mistake, it sends him into a strange new world: where futuristic technology rules and sheer terror fills the hearts of ordinary citizens. He can't seem to escape this nightmarish dream!
