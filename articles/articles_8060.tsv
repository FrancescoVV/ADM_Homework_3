The Vision	Fallen Star #3	Jessica Sorensen	4.15	13364	382	The Vision is book 3 in the Fallen Star Series. Gemma thought she was trapped—that Stephan had finally won. But then time resets and she’s given another chance. The clock is ticking as Gemma tries to figure out how to change the vision that ends the world in ice. If she can, then maybe she can save the world from Stephan and give her and Alex a chance at a real future. But changing visions can be dangerous, and sometimes one small mistake can lead to disastrous results. Newly edited version released on 11/25/11.
