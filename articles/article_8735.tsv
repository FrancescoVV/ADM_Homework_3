Absent in the Spring		Mary Westmacott, Agatha Christie	4.15	11940	365	Returning from a visit to her daughter in Iraq, Joan Scudamore finds herself unexpectedly alone and stranded in an isolated rest house by flooding of the railway tracks. This sudden solitude compels Joan to assess her life for the first time ever and face up to many of the truths about herself. Looking back over the years, Joan painfully re-examines her attitudes, relationships and actions and becomes increasingly uneasy about the person who is revealed to her.	190	August 1944	Kate Dawson, Joan Scudamore, Rodney Scudamore, Blanche Haggard, Tony Scudamore, Averil Harrison-Wilmott, Barbara Wray, William Wray, Myrna Randolph, Michael Callaway, Nobby Reid, Charles Edward Sherston, Leslie Adeline Sherston, Edward Harrison-Wilmott, Agnes		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140345.Absent_in_the_Spring
