Hallucinations: or, The Ill-Fated Peregrinations of Fray Servando		Reinaldo Arenas, Andrew Hurley, Thomas Colchie	4.09	443	44	In the brilliant tradition of Don Quixote and Candide , this passionate novel by the author of Before Night Falls is a modern masterpiece of Latin American fiction. Fray Servando--priest, blasphemer, dueler of monsters, irresistible lover, misunderstood prophet, prisoner, and consummate escape artist--wanders among the vice-ridden populations of eighteenth-century Europe and the Americas, fleeing dungeons, a marriage-minded woman, a slave ship captain, and the Inquisition. Whether by burro, by boat, or by the back of a whale, Fray Servando's journey is at once funny and romantic, melancholy and profound--a tale rooted in history, yet outrageously hallucinatory. "An impenitent amalgam of truth and invention, historical fact and outrageous make-believe . . . a philosophical black comedy."-- The New York Times	288	1966	Friar Servando, Frei Servando		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36555.Hallucinations
