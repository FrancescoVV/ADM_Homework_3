The Gypsy Morph	Genesis of Shannara #3	Terry Brooks	4.15	12638	481	Eighty years into the future, the United States is a no-man's-land, its landscape blighted by chemical warfare, pollution, and plague. In fortified compounds, survivors hold the line against an enemy neither mortal nor merciful: demons and their minions bent on slaughtering and subjugating the last of humankind. But from around the country, allies of good unite to challenge the rampaging evil. Logan Tom, wielding the magic staff of a Knight of the Word, has promised to protect the world's only hope of salvation. Angel Perez, Logan's fellow Knight, has risked her life to aid the peaceful elvish race, marked for extermination by the forces of the Void. Kirisin Belloruus, a young elf entrusted with an ancient magic, must deliver his entire civilization from a monstrous army. And Hawk, the rootless boy who is nothing less than destiny's instrument, must lead the last of humanity to a latter-day promised land before the final darkness falls.	402	2008	Hawk (Shannara), Findo Gask, Logan Tom, Angel Perez		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2675261-the-gypsy-morph
