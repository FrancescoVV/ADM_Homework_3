The Murders in the Rue Morgue: The Dupin Tales	C. Auguste Dupin #1-3	Edgar Allan Poe, Matthew Pearl	3.88	6827	276	Includes “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Mystery of Marie Rogêt,” and “The Purloined Letter” Between 1841 and 1844, Edgar Allan Poe invented the genre of detective fiction with three mesmerizing stories of a young French eccentric named C. Auguste Dupin. Introducing to literature the concept of applying reason to solving crime, these tales brought Poe fame and fortune. Years later, Dorothy Sayers would describe “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” as “almost a complete manual of detective theory and practice.” Indeed, Poe’s short mysteries inspired the creation of countless literary sleuths, among them Sherlock Holmes. Today, the unique Dupin stories still stand out as utterly engrossing page-turners.	160	1844	C. Auguste Dupin		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45793.The_Murders_in_the_Rue_Morgue
