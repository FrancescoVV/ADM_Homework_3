Possessed	Rayne #1	Kate Cann	3.48	1481	203	A dark, gothic tale set in modern-day England, this thriller love story will captivate fans of Twilight and Wicked Lovely. Rayne can't wait to start her summer job at a remote country mansion, far from the crowded, noisy London she so desperately wants to escape. But the retreat soon turns into a nightmare -- the mansion is creepy, the legends of ghosts keep Rayne up at night, and she doesn't feel safe anywhere. Can Rayne figure out why she's so freaked -- before she becomes a ghost story herself?	336	July 7th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6609769-possessed
