Blood Cross	Jane Yellowrock #2	Faith Hunter	4.15	22444	815	Jane Yellowrock is back on the prowl against the children of the night... The vampire council has hired skinwalker Jane Yellowrock to hunt and kill one of their own who has broken sacred ancient rules — but Jane quickly realizes that in a community that is thousands of years old, loyalties run deep... With the help of her witch best friend and local vigilantes, Jane finds herself caught between bitter rivalries — and closer than ever to the secret origin of the entire vampire race. But in a city of old grudges and dark magic, Jane will have to fight to protect both sides, even if no one will protect her.	321	January 5th 2010	Molly Trueblood, Brian Robere, Brandon Robere, Jane Yellowrock, Leo Pellissier, George "Bruiser" Dumas, Rick (Ricky Bo) LeFleur, Beast, Tom (Troll), Jodi Richoux, Aggie One Feather, Sabina Delgado y Aguilera, Bettina Rousseau, Angelina Trueblood, Evan Trueblood, Derek Lee, Evangeline Everhart	New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6659254-blood-cross
