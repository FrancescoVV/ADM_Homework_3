The Chronicles of a Crazy Chick		Katina Pittman	3.21	33	5	Chronicles of a Crazy Chick recounts the misadventures of Pittman—a brutally frank, flippant and sometimes sexually frustrated female – through the ins and outs of relationships, including the one with herself where she pens a letter to the Lord asking for guidance when her life is in disarray. Katina explores surviving a sexless relationship where she employs extreme measures against her partner, stalking a dude in the name of sex, denouncing online dating after failed attempts at finding love, longing for a lover lost to murder and suffering an episode of hypochondria when thinking she was exposed to HIV. Spoken in Pittman’s candid and crass voice, these page-turning and laugh-out-loud essays tackle issues facing a modern day woman with intimate and irreverent details. These stories unveil the humor in even the serious of situations.	190	October 16th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16111930-the-chronicles-of-a-crazy-chick
