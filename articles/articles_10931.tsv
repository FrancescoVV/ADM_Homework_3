Vicious	Sinners of Saint #1	L.J. Shen	4.15	62364	6696	Emilia They say love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances, and it’s true. The man who comes to me in my dreams also haunts me in my nightmares. He is a brilliant lawyer. A skilled criminal. A beautiful liar. A bully and a savior, a monster and a lover. Ten years ago, he made me run away from the small town where we lived. Now, he came for me in New York, and he isn’t leaving until he takes me with him. Vicious She is a starving artist. Pretty and evasive like cherry blossom. Ten years ago, she barged into my life unannounced and turned everything upside down. She paid the price. Emilia LeBlanc is completely off-limits, my best friend’s ex-girlfriend. The woman who knows my darkest secret, and the daughter of the cheap Help we hired to take care of our estate. That should deter me from chasing her, but it doesn’t. So she hates me. Big fucking deal. She better get used to me.	339	December 27th 2016	Vicious Spencer, Emilia LeBlanc, Rosie LeBlanc, Dean Cole, Trent Rexroth, Jaimie Followhill, Melody Greene	New York City, New York (United States), Todos Santos, California (United States), San Diego, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30839185-vicious
