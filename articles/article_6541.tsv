Dragon's Bait		Vivian Vande Velde	3.93	7547	391	Fifteen-year-old Alys is not a witch. But that doesn't matter—the villagers think she is and have staked her out on a hillside as a sacrifice to the local dragon. It's late, it's cold, and it's raining, and Alys can think of only one thing—revenge. But first she's got to escape, and even if she does, how can one girl possibly take on an entire town alone? Then the dragon arrives—a dragon that could quite possibly be the perfect ally. . . .	196	September 1st 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/372807.Dragon_s_Bait
