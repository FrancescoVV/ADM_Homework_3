Ryan's Bed		Tijan	4.25	15009	2072	I crawled into Ryan Jensen’s bed that first night by accident. I barely knew him. I thought it was his sister’s bed—her room. It took seconds to realize my error, and I should've left... I didn’t. I didn’t jump out. I didn’t get embarrassed. I relaxed. And that night, in that moment, it was the only thing I craved. I asked to stay. He let me, and I slept. The truth? I never wanted to leave his bed. If I could've stayed forever, I would have. He became my sanctuary. Because—four hours earlier—my twin sister killed herself.	250	January 21st 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36615592-ryan-s-bed
