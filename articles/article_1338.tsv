Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy	George Smiley #5	John le Carré	4.04	74517	4035	A modern classic in which John le Carré expertly creates a total vision of a secret world, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy begins George Smiley's chess match of wills and wits with Karla, his Soviet counterpart. It is now beyond a doubt that a mole, implanted decades ago by Moscow Centre, has burrowed his way into the highest echelons of British Intelligence. His treachery has already blown some of its most vital operations and its best networks. It is clear that the double agent is one of its own kind. But which one? George Smiley is assigned to identify him. And once identified, the traitor must be destroyed.	381	1974	Jim Prideaux, Peter Guillam, Bill Roach, Ricki Tarr, Percy Alleline, Bill Haydon, Roddy Martindale, Toby Esterhase, Connie Sachs, Oliver Lacon, Inspector Mendel, Aleksey Polyakov, Roy Bland, Ann Smiley, George Smiley	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10073506-tinker-tailor-soldier-spy
