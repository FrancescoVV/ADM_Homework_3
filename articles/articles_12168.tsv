Peace, Love, and Baby Ducks		Lauren Myracle	3.75	4988	482	Wealth, privilege, and way too many pastel-tinted opinions...that's Carly's life. And guess what? It's. Getting. On. Her. Nerves. Carly wants to be real , and she's always counted on her little sister, Anna, to love her and support her—and tell her how right she is. But when Anna turns "hot" over the course of a single summer, everything goes weird. Suddenly Anna's swimming in the deep end with the big girls—while Carly watches, hurt, from the kiddie pool. And of course there are boys involved, complicating things as boys always do.	289	May 14th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5711749-peace-love-and-baby-ducks
