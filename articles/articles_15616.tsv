DANTE LIVES Vampire. Rock star. Begotten son of the fallen angel Lucien. Dante Baptiste still struggles with nightmares and seizures, searching for the truth about his past. It is a quest as seductive as his kiss, as uncontrollable as his thirst, and as unforgiving as his determination to protect one mortal woman at any cost. KNOWLEDGE KILLS FBI Special Agent Heather Wallace now knows the extent of the Bureau corruption that surrounds her, but worries that she is losing the battle. And when Dante and his band Inferno come to Seattle on tour, Heather can’t help but be drawn back to the beautiful, dangerous nightkind. But what Heather and Dante don’t know is that new enemies lurk in the shadows, closer than they think . . . and even deadlier than they fear.	400	December 24th 2008	Dante Baptiste, Heather Wallace, Lucien DeNoir	Seattle, Washington (United States), Damascus, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2888973-in-the-blood
