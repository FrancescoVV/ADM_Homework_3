The Iliad/The Odyssey		Homer, Robert Fagles, Bernard Knox	4.04	63011	761	Gripping listeners and readers for more than 2,700 years, 'The Iliad' is the story of the Trojan War and the rage of Achilles. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. If 'The Iliad' is the world's greatest war story, then 'The Odyssey' is literature's greatest evocation of every man's journey through life. Here again, Fagles has performed the translator's task magnificently, giving us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Each volume contains a superb introduction with textual and critical commentary by renowned classicist Bernard Knox.	1556	-800	Odysseus, Menelaus, Hector of Troy, Achilles (Greek hero), Sarpedon (king of Lycia), Patroclus, Agamemnon		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1375.The_Iliad_The_Odyssey
