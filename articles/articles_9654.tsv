Born in Fire	Born In Trilogy #1	Nora Roberts	4.22	67999	1282	Three modern sisters bound by the timeless beauty of Ireland... The eldest Concannon sister, Maggie, is a reclusive, stubborn and free-spirited glassmaker—with a heart worth winning. Margaret Mary is a glass artist with an independent streak as fierce as her volatile temper. Hand-blowing glass is a difficult and exacting art, and while she may produce the delicate and the fragile, Maggie is a strong and opinionated woman, a Clare woman, with all the turbulence of that fascinating west country. One man, Dublin gallery owner Rogan Sweeney, has seen the soul in Maggie’s art, and vows to help her build a career. When he comes to Maggie’s studio, her heart is inflamed by their fierce attraction—and her scarred past is slowly healed by love...	416	October 1st 1994	Maggie Concannon, Rogan Sweeney, Brianna Concannon	Kilmihil, County Clare (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43604960-born-in-fire
