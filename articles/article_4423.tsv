The Mating	Law of the Lycans #1	Nicky Charles	3.98	27374	2199	She lay beside him, staring blankly at the ceiling. The deed was done. They were mated. It didn't matter that she had no love for him nor he for her. Political alliances were more important than feelings, or so she had been told. That fact was cold comfort right now as her heart broke within her. Elise had no idea when she came home that day that she'd end up mated to a complete stranger. A new Alpha and the need for an alliance between packs have made her a pawn.	340	January 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13248590-the-mating
