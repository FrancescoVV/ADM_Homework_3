The Singer of All Songs	The Chanters of Tremaris #1	Kate Constable	3.90	10069	402	Calwyn has never been beyond the high ice-wall that guards the sisters of Antaris from the world of Tremaris. She knows only the rounds of her life as a novice ice priestess, tending her bees, singing her ice chantments, and dreaming. But then Calwyn befriends Darrow, a mysterious Outlander who appears inside the Wall and warns of an approaching danger. To help Darrow, to see the world, and perhaps to save it, Calwyn will leave the safety of the Wall for a journey with a man she barely knows--and an adventure as beautiful and dangerous as the music of chantment itself.	320	September 1st 2002	Calwyn, Darrow, Mica, Tonno, Halasaa		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/489612.The_Singer_of_All_Songs
