Regeneration	Regeneration #1	Pat Barker	4.03	25428	1554	Regeneration , one in Pat Barker's series of novels confronting the psychological effects of World War I, focuses on treatment methods during the war and the story of a decorated English officer sent to a military hospital after publicly declaring he will no longer fight. Yet the novel is much more. Written in sparse prose that is shockingly clear—the descriptions of electronic treatments are particularly harrowing—it combines real-life characters and events with fictional ones in a work that examines the insanity of war like no other. Barker also weaves in issues of class and politics in this compactly powerful book. Other books in the series include The Eye in the Door and the Booker Award winner The Ghost Road .	256	1991	Robert Graves, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Billy Prior, Dr. William Rivers, Sarah Lumb, David Burns, Dr. Lewis Yealland	Craiglockhart War Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5872.Regeneration
