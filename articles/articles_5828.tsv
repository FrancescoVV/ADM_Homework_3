Vlad: The Last Confession		C.C. Humphreys, Chris Humphreys	3.87	2975	335	Dracula. A name of horror, depravity and the darkest sensuality. Yet the real Dracula was just as alluring, just as terrifying, his tale not one of a monster but of a man... and a contradiction. His tale is told by those who knew him best. The only woman he ever loved...and whom he had to sacrifice. His closest comrade...and traitor. And his priest, betraying the secrets of the confessional to reveal the mind of the man history would forever remember as The Impaler. This is the story of the man behind the legend...as it has never been told before.	366	January 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4712458-vlad
