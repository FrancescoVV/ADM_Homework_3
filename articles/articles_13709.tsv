Deathwish	夜に彷徨うもの #5	Rob Thurman	4.10	5875	214	In a nightmarish new york city, life is there for the taking... Half-human Cal Leandros and his brother, Niko, are barely getting by with their preternatural detective agency when the vampire Seamus hires them. He's being followed, and he wants to know by whom. But the Leandros brothers have to do more than they had planned when Seamus turns up dead (or un-undead). — Worse still is the return of Cal's nightmarish family, the Auphe. The last time Cal and Niko faced them, the Auphe were almost wiped out. Now they want revenge. Cal knows that before the Auphe get to him, they will try to destroy everything and everyone he holds dear. Because for the Auphe, Cal's pain is a pleasure. And they're feeling good.	336	March 3rd 2009	Cal Leandros, Niko Leandros, Puck, Promise	United States of America, New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3831023-deathwish
