The Good Soldier		Ford Madox Ford, Kenneth Womack, William Baker	3.71	22717	1598	"A Tale of Passion," as its subtitle declares, The Good Soldier relates the complex social and sexual relationships between two couples, one English, one American, and the growing awareness by the American narrator John Dowell of the intrigues and passions behind their orderly Edwardian facade. It is the attitude of Dowell, his puzzlement, his uncertainty, and the seemingly haphazard manner of his narration that make the book so powerful and mysterious. Despite its catalogue of death, insanity, and despair, the novel has many comic moments, and has inspired the work of several distinguished writers, including Graham Greene. This is the only annotated edition available.	368	March 17th 1915	John Dowell, Edward Ashburnham, Leonora Ashburnham, Nancy Rufford, Florence Dowell, Bagshawe, Maisie Maidan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7628.The_Good_Soldier
