The Mind Thing		Fredric Brown	3.70	234	26	HE was really an "IT" He was incapable of love or mercy or hate. And he certainly never felt the lack. He was almost pure thought. He was just doing what he had to do - looking for the right body to play host to him. Once he found it and moved in, he would execute one of the most incredible plans ever conceived. He would be hailed as a hero on his own planet and EARTH WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT HIT IT!	208	January 1961			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/439065.The_Mind_Thing
