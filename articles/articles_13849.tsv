Sailor Twain: Or: The Mermaid in the Hudson		Mark  Siegel	3.70	3583	548	One hundred years ago. On the foggy Hudson River, a riverboat captain rescues an injured mermaid from the waters of the busiest port in the United States. A wildly popular—and notoriously reclusive—author makes a public debut. A French nobleman seeks a remedy for a curse. As three lives twine together and race to an unexpected collision, the mystery of the Mermaid of the Hudson deepens. A mysterious and beguiling love story with elements of Poe, Twain, Hemingway, and Greek mythology, drawn in moody black-and-white charcoal, Sailor Twain is a study in romance, atmosphere, and suspense.	399	September 27th 2011		Hudson River, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538702-sailor-twain
