A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man		James Joyce, Seamus Deane, Jim Norton, Hans Walter Gabler, Jeri Johnson, J.M. Gaffney, Ludmila Savitzky	3.62	128385	5315	The portrayal of Stephen Dedalus's Dublin childhood and youth, his quest for identity through art and his gradual emancipation from the claims of family, religion and Ireland itself, is also an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce and a universal testament to the artist's 'eternal imagination'. Both an insight into Joyce's life and childhood, and a unique work of modernist fiction, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a novel of sexual awakening, religious rebellion and the essential search for voice and meaning that every nascent artist must face in order to blossom fully into themselves.	329	1916	Stephen Dedalus, Simon Dedalus, Fr.
