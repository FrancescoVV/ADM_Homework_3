I'm With You		Allie Frost	4.26	431	13	When fifteen-year-old Ciarán Morrigan eavesdrops on a conversation between his father and two mysterious strangers, his life--and the life of his little sister, Remiel--is changed forever. After their father makes a startling decision, the Morrigan siblings are forced to flee the only life they've ever known and embark on a dangerous adventure across the nation of Empirya. With the help of a disinherited vagabond, a cynical violinist, a fire-juggler with a fierce temper, an aspiring mechanic, and a cheerful librarian, Ciarán and Remiel must fight to escape those who have been hired to hunt them. But will Remiel's dark secret prevent the Morrigan children from finding a place they can truly call home?		September 26th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32454770-i-m-with-you
