Rainbow Valley	Anne of Green Gables #7	L.M. Montgomery	4.01	39010	1270	Anne Shirley is grown up, has married her beloved Gilbert, and is the mother of six mischievous children. These boys and girls discover a special place all their own, but they never dream of what will happen when a strange family moves into an old mansion nearby. The Meredith clan is two boys and two girlsâ€”and a runaway named Mary Vance. Soon the Merediths join Anne's children in their private hideout, intent on carrying out their plans to save Mary from the orphanage, to help the lonely minister find happiness, and to keep a pet rooster from the soup pot. There's always an adventure brewing in the sun-dappled world of Rainbow Valley.	225	1919	Anne Shirley, Gilbert Blythe, James Matthew (Jem) Blythe, Walter Blythe, Anne (Nan) Blythe, Diana (Di) Blythe, Jerry Meredith, Carl Meredith, Faith Meredith, Una Meredith, Mary Vance, John Meredith, Rosemary West, Ellen West, Norman Douglas, Cornelia (Bryant) Elliott	Prince Edward Island (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77395.Rainbow_Valley
