Bluebeard		Kurt Vonnegut Jr.	4.04	34831	1395	Broad humor and bitter irony collide in this fictional autobiography of Rabo Karabekian, who, at age seventy-one, wants to be left alone on his Long Island estate with the secret he has locked inside his potato barn. But then a voluptuous young widow badgers Rabo into telling his life story—and Vonnegut in turn tells us the plain, heart-hammering truth about man’s careless fancy to create or destroy what he loves.	318	October 1987	Rabo Karabekian		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9601.Bluebeard
