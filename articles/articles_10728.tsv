Numerology and the Divine Triangle		Dusty Bunker	4.23	374	24	At last a truly comprehensive and authoritative text on numerology! Part I is a complete introduction to esoteric numerology. Part II includes extensive delineations of each of the numbers 1 to 78 and, for the first time in book form, a synthesis of numerology, astrology and the Tarot. Each number is explained as personal number vibrations, as a temporary number vibration, in terms of its astrological correspondence and in terms of its Tarot symbolism. Each of the Tarot cards is illustrated. Numerology and the Divine Triangle is the book to which all books on the subject will be compared from now on.	288	March 1st 1979			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108314.Numerology_and_the_Divine_Triangle
