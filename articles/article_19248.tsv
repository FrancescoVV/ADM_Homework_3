August D 13th		Chukwuemeka Nwaoma	4.00	4	0	The bitterness that comes with being called a ‘bastard’ overwhelmed 13-year-old Basil as he yielded to shedding blood for the anniversary of his birth. For his murdered mother, older Basil had a better plan, one that would satisfy the thirst for vengeance. Making sure no one was watching, Basil walked into the farmhouse, carrying the farm tools he had selected. Henry, his father who had remained a drunkard after falling out of love with his wife Abigail, staggered out of the bar, humming drunkenly and walked up the dirt road towards the farmhouse. Basil waited until his father pushed the door open and staggered inside. While the old man tried to recover from the shock of a flashlight on his face, he felt a machete slash through his abdomen. Basil had executed his long-awaited perfect plan. It was the thirteenth of August, and he was never going to forget it. Grab a fan, some sweet tea, then sit back and enjoy this quick little tease. If you enjoy an over-the-top Alpha, dark-hearted young lad who wouldn’t let his father get away with murder, then this book has you covered whether you’re coming or going.	22	December 18th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43302926-august-d-13th
