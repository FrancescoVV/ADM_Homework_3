Beer in the Snooker Club		Waguih Ghali	3.97	2745	422	This reissue of the late Waguih Ghali's only novel makes us mourn his loss all the more keenly. A plainspoken writer of consummate wryness, grace, and humor, the Egyptian author chronicles the lives of a polyglot Cairene upper crust, shortly after the fall of King Farouk, who are thoroughly unprepared to change their neo-feudal ways. This is the best book to date about post-Farouk Egypt.-Sylvie Drake, Los Angeles Times	222	1964			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1231621.Beer_in_the_Snooker_Club
