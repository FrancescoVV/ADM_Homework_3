Sideways Stories from Wayside School	Wayside School #1	Louis Sachar, Adam McCauley	4.15	89899	2609	There was a terrible mistake - Wayside School was built with one classroom on top of another, thirty stories high (The builder said he was sorry.) Maybe that's why all kinds of funny things happened at Wayside-especially on the thirteenth floor.	144	1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15779.Sideways_Stories_from_Wayside_School
