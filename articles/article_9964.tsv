Rock Chick Reckoning	Rock Chick #6	Kristen Ashley	4.42	28816	1567	Stella’s the lead singer and lead guitarist of The Blue Moon Gypsies and Stella used to be Mace’s girl. Mace broke up with her, though, and the loss of him rocked her world. But Stella gets a call, late at night (again) from one of the members of her crazy band. She has to go play clean up (again) and runs into Mace and a shed load of police, and ends up getting shot. Mace finds he doesn’t like it much that his ex-girlfriend got shot right in front of him but it’s worse. A very bad man has thrown down the gauntlet and all the Rock Chicks are in the firing line. Stella doesn’t want Mace to be the one to keep her alive, but she has no choice. Mainly because Mace isn’t giving her one.	484	November 13th 2011	Stella Michelle Gun, Kai "Mace" Mason	Denver, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13065142-rock-chick-reckoning
