Soul'tweets'		Suman Arora	5.00	2	0	The book, “Soul'tweets'” talks about the lighter side of the complex human emotions, based on interesting anecdotes from various real life situations. The interesting dimensions of human relations will capture the readers’ interest and they are sure to have a strong sense of amused déjà-vu. At times, life looks stranger than fiction and at times it amuses you no end, like a friend. It throws challenges at you to shower you with rich experience and makes you more capable of handling things with effortless ease. The key factor is positivity in all situations. I have tried to infuse some healthy humour in my interpretation of complexity and intensity of human emotions. The life is depicted in the book in different hues. Soul'tweets' is based on your life, my life, and everyone’s life and it reflects your everyday life moments. This book belongs to you, dear reader, irrespective of your age group!	168	February 22nd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24455791-soul-tweets
