Residual Effects of Slavery		LaTonya Page-Balkcom	5.00	3	1	The awakening of brainwashed minds is a slow and delicate process but, must be done. An estimate of 500 years of physical and mental slavery is long enough but, takes time to restore. The Spirit of Slavery has severed the soul of POC (People of Color) in many ways. One could only imagine how the heinous and despicable conditions people who were enslaved endured would affect the Minds and the Self-Worth of a person of Africa Descent for many centuries. Generations being held hostage emotionally and spiritually prohibiting progress of self-determination. This book will not shrink from the task of detailing perhaps some of these awful, painful criminal acts and circumstances connected to chattel slavery in efforts to finally help others somewhat understand the depths of the evil inflicted on generations of people of color psyche. In hopes to perhaps, promote awareness of these past evils that no one speaks about, that inhibits a desire for self-awareness self-healing, self-love, self-worth and self-determination within the hearts of POC. It is past time for people of Africa descent to heal from the Social effects of the negative energies that were attached to chattel Slavery. Including but, not limited to understanding the effects of the text within the Willie Lynch Letter depicting the mental and emotional bondage inflicted on POC with the evil intent of perpetuating the residual effects of Slavery for generations to come. The effect of Stockholm syndrome operating in the minds of many today perhaps prohibits the healing process of POC to develop Self-Love, Self-Worth and self-determination. This may be one of the last generations that are willing, able and ready to THINK their way out of this mental and emotional bondage of the Residual Effects of Slavery and actually thrive for mental and emotional freedoms. Rally, March or Petition if you will but, nothing is going to change until your mind changes. Change only happens on the inside but, will manifest on the outside. Some have thought POC would've been further along, in society than what they appear to be today. But, many know why the progress of a people seems stifled. Perhaps, loving self is the only justice one must seek that will build enough courage and confident to finally once and for all break free.
