Rum Punch	Ordell Robbie & Louis Gara #2	Elmore Leonard	3.90	9056	466	Ordell Robbie makes a fine living selling illegal high-powered weaponry to the wrong people. Jackie Burke couriers Ordell's profits from Freeport to Miami. But the feds are on to Jackie - and now the aging, but still hot, flight attendant will have to do prison time or play ball, which makes her a prime 'loose end' that Ordell needs to tie up...permanently. Jackie, however, has other plans. And with the help of Max Cherry - an honest but disgruntled bail bondsman looking to get out - she could even end up with a serious nest egg in the process.	304	1992	Ordell Robbie, Louis Gara, Jackie Burke, Max Cherry		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240910.Rum_Punch
