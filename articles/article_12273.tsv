The Year I Turned 25: A Memoir About Sex, Anxiety and a Dog Named She-Devil		Raquel Fletcher	4.15	125	7	"I always thought twenty-five was the year I’d finally be grown up, the year the world would finally start taking me seriously, the year I would finally know what I wanted. And yet…” The Year I Turned 25 catalogues the ups and downs of a TV reporter in her mid-twenties, who takes on the added challenge of training an adorable, but misbehaving puppy. Sometimes melancholic and other times hilarious, this brave and thought-provoking memoir approaches dating, sexual assault and mental health in a personal, but relatable way. This book is for every woman who ever asked herself if something was wrong with her and for every dog lover who discovered true love in a puppy. “This project isn't about – and was never about – figuring out who I am. It’s about figuring out how to figure out who I am."		January 26th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34342049-the-year-i-turned-25
