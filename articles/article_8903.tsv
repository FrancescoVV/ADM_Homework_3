Venom	Elemental Assassin #3	Jennifer Estep	4.16	21414	905	What kind of assassin works pro bono? It’s hard to be a badass assassin when a giant is beating the crap out of you. Luckily, I never let pride get in the way of my work. My current mission is personal: annihilate Mab Monroe, the Fire elemental who murdered my family. Which means protecting my identity, even if I have to conceal my powerful Stone and Ice magic when I need it most. To the public, I’m Gin Blanco, owner of Ashland’s best barbecue joint. To my friends, I’m the Spider, retired assassin. I still do favors on the side. Like ridding a vampire friend of her oversized stalker—Mab’s right-hand goon who almost got me dead with his massive fists. At least irresistible Owen Grayson is on my side. The man knows too much about me, but I’ll take my chances. Then there’s Detective Bria Coolidge, one of Ashland’s finest. Until recently, I thought my baby sister was dead. She probably thinks the same about me. Little does she know, I’m a cold-blooded killer . . . who is about to save her life.	389	September 17th 2010	Gin Blanco, Finnegan Lane, Owen Grayson, Jonah McAllister, Bria Coolidge, Mab Monroe, Sophia Deveraux, Xavier (Giant), Jolene "Jo-Jo" Deveraux, Roslyn Phillips, Elliot Slater (Giant)	Ashland, Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7614747-venom
