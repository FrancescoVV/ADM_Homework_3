The Wife Between Us		Greer Hendricks, Sarah Pekkanen	3.84	225605	22076	When you read this book, you will make many assumptions. You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife. You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement â€“ a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle. Assume nothing. Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's The Wife Between Us exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love. Read between the lies.	346	January 2nd 2018	Richard Thompson, Maureen Thompson, Vanessa	New York City's Upper East Side (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34189556-the-wife-between-us
