A Separate Reality	The Teachings of Don Juan #2	Carlos Casta√±eda	4.06	16657	273	"A man of knowledge is free...he has no honor, no dignity, no family, no home, no country, but only life to be lived." --don Juan In 1961 a young anthropologist subjected himself to an extraordinary apprenticeship to bring back a fascinating glimpse of a Yaqui Indian's world of "non-ordinary reality" and the difficult and dangerous road a man must travel to become "a man of knowledge." Yet on the bring of that world, challenging to all that we believe, he drew back. Then in 1968, Carlos Castaneda returned to Mexico, to don Juan and his hallucinogenic drugs, and to a world of experience no man from our Western civilization had ever entered before.	272	1968	Don Juan	Mexico	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12839.A_Separate_Reality
