A Home at the End of the World		Michael Cunningham	3.92	17950	956	Michael Cunninghamâ€™s celebrated novel is the story of two boyhood friends: Jonathan, lonely, introspective, and unsure of himself; and Bobby, hip, dark, and inarticulate. In New York after college, Bobby moves in with Jonathan and his roommate, Clare, a veteran of the city's erotic wars. Bobby and Clare fall in love, scuttling the plans of Jonathan, who is gay, to father Clare's child. Then, when Clare and Bobby have a baby, the three move to a small house upstate to raise "their" child together and, with an odd friend, Alice, create a new kind of family. A Home at the End of the World masterfully depicts the charged, fragile relationships of urban life today.	342	1990		New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2137.A_Home_at_the_End_of_the_World
