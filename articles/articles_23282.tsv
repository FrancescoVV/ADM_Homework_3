The Seven Mysteries of Life: An Exploration of Science and Philosophy		Guy Murchie	4.39	404	58	"All life in all worlds" -this was the object of the author's seventeen-year quest for knowledge and discovery, culminating in this book. In a manner unmistakably his own, Murchie delves into the interconnectedness of all life on the planet and of such fields as biology, geology, sociology, mathematics, and physics. He offers us what the poet May Sarton has called "a good book to take to a desert island as sole companion, so rich is it in knowledge and insight."	690	June 1st 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/390786.The_Seven_Mysteries_of_Life
