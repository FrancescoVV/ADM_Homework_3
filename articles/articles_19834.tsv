Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account		Miklós Nyiszli, Tibère Kremer, Bruno Bettelheim, Richard Seaver	4.29	16882	1389	When the Nazis invaded Hungary in 1944, they sent virtually the entire Jewish population to Auschwitz. A Jew and a medical doctor, the prisoner Dr. Miklos Nyiszli was spared death for a grimmer fate: to perform "scientific research" on his fellow inmates under the supervision of the man who became known as the infamous "Angel of Death" - Dr. Josef Mengele. Nyiszli was named Mengele's personal research pathologist. In that capactity he also served as physician to the Sonderkommando, the Jewish prisoners who worked exclusively in the crematoriums and were routinely executed after four months. Miraculously, Nyiszli survived to give this horrifying and sobering account.	222	1946		Auschwitz (Poland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/315578.Auschwitz
