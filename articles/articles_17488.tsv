When he welcomes his son Chuck for a summer visit, the eleven-year-old suspects something is not right at his father's home. His worries mount when he witnesses a confrontation between his father and some local hunters. Zane Carver is the local gun-shop owner who confronts the author over Owen's refusal to let anyone on his land for hunting or camping. He defies the recluse, taking a hunting party onto Owen's property. Soon, Zane and his buddies discover the writer's secret . . . a deadly secret; a creature whose infinite rage they have unwittingly ignited . . . that is now hunting them.	230	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16008616-progeny
