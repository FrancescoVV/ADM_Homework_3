Shadow Tag		Louise Erdrich	3.39	6602	1414	“Erdrich is a true original… [and] one of our major writers.” — Washington Post Book World Shadow Tag , the brilliant new novel by Louise Erdrich, is a stunning tour-de-force from the National Book Critics Circle Award–winning and New York Times –bestselling author of Love Medicine and Pulitzer-Prize-finalist The Plague of Doves . In the vein of the novels of such contemporaries as Zoe Heller and Susan Minot, Shadow Tag is an intense and heart-wrenching story of a troubled marriage and a family in disarray—and a radical departure from Erdrich’s previous acclaimed work.	255	2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6673172-shadow-tag
