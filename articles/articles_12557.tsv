The Probability Broach	North American Confederacy #1	L. Neil Smith	3.84	445	50	Denver detective Win Bear, on the trail of a murderer, discovers much more than a killer. He accidentally stumbles upon the probability broach, a portal to a myriad of worlds--some wildly different from, others disconcertingly similar to our own. Win finds himself transported to an alternate Earth where Congress is in Colorado, everyone carries a gun, there are gorillas in the Senate, and public services are controlled by private businesses.	324	December 12th 1979	American Law Enforcement	Denver, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/997897.The_Probability_Broach
