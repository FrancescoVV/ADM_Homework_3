The Crane Wife		Patrick Ness	3.53	7238	1266	THE EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENS EVERYDAY One night, George Duncan is woken by a noise in his garden. Impossibly, a great white crane has tumbled to earth, shot through its wing by an arrow. Unexpectedly moved, George helps the bird, and from the moment he watches it fly away, his life is transformed. The next day, a beautiful woman called Kumiko walks into his shop and begins to tell him the most extraordinary story. Wise, romantic, magical and funny, The Crane Wife is a celebration of the disruptive and redemptive power of love.	305	April 4th 2013	George Duncan	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13638462-the-crane-wife
