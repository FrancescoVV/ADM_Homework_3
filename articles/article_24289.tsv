A Dragon's Guide to the Care and Feeding of Humans	A Dragon's Guide #1	Laurence Yep, Joanne Ryder	3.78	1723	318	Crusty dragon Miss Drake has a new pet human, precocious Winnie. Oddly enough, Winnie seems to think Miss Drake is her pet—a ridiculous notion! Unknown to most of its inhabitants, the City by the Bay is home to many mysterious and fantastic creatures, hidden beneath the parks, among the clouds, and even in plain sight. And Winnie wants to draw every new creature she encounters: the good, the bad, and the ugly. But Winnie’s sketchbook is not what it seems. Somehow, her sketchlings have been set loose on the city streets! It will take Winnie and Miss Drake’s combined efforts to put an end to the mayhem . . . before it’s too late.	152	March 10th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551747-a-dragon-s-guide-to-the-care-and-feeding-of-humans
