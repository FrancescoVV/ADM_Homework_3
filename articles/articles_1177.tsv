Black Like Me		John Howard Griffin	4.11	61569	2756	In the Deep South of the 1950s, journalist John Howard Griffin decided to cross the color line. Using medication that darkened his skin to deep brown, he exchanged his privileged life as a Southern white man for the disenfranchised world of an unemployed black man. His audacious, still chillingly relevant eyewitness history is a work about race and humanity-that in this new millennium still has something important to say to every American.	208	1961		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42603.Black_Like_Me
