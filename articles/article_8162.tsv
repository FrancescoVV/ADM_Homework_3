Ved Maya		Vineeta Malhotra Taneja	4.79	130	75	What happens when destiny wants to bring two people together? And what happens when one of them accepts this as a gift of God, while the other refuses to bow down to destiny? Ved, a young man who climbed the success ladder with sheer hard work and determination, is as attached to his roots as ever. A humble, helpful and gentle soul who is loved by all…except by the one woman he loves with all his heart. Maya, a young and vivacious girl, who has been challenged by fate time and again. From being left motherless at the tender age of three, to being shunned by her family at 22, Maya didn’t have it easy. While Ved opens his heart for Maya, she makes it clear to him that the only feeling she will ever have for him is hatred. Come and embark on this journey of emotions, misunderstandings, love...and be a part of their emotional rollercoaster ride.		April 21st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45286378-ved-maya
