Impossible	Impossible #1	Nancy Werlin	3.63	17293	2468	Lucy is seventeen when she discovers that she is the latest recipient of a generations-old family curse that requires her to complete three seemingly impossible tasks or risk falling into madness and passing the curse on to the next generation. Unlike her ancestors, though, Lucy has family, friends, and other modern resources to help her out. But will it be enough to conquer this age-old evil? A beautifully wrought modern fairy tale from master storyteller and award-winning author Nancy Werlin. Inspired by the classic folk ballad "Scarborough Fair," this is a wonderfully riveting and haunting novel of suspense, romance, and fantasy.	384	September 18th 2008	Lucy Scarborough, Zach Greenfield, Padraig Seeley, Miranda Scarborough, Soledad Markowitz	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3188580-impossible
