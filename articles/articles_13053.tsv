Sheltered	Deeper Than Desire #2	Charlotte Stein	3.64	5404	484	Evie has lived her entire life under her abusive father’s thumb. He controls everything. Where she goes to college, who she sees, what she does. But when she meets Van—a punk who shows her how different life could be—she realizes how much she’s been missing. Van offers her excitement, protection, love…and most of all, sex—even if he’s at first reluctant to give her all the things she’s been craving. She wants to explore this new world of arousal and desire, but Van is only too aware of how fragile she is, how innocent... And how much is at stake, when their love is forbidden.	162	March 9th 2012	Eve "Evie" Bennett, Tyler "Van" Vandervoort		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13518793-sheltered
