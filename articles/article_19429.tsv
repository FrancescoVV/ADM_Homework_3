You were the Soul to my Existence		Amna Dhanani	4.48	23	12	You were the Soul to my Existence is a pure example of how the one you love is nothing else but the soul of one's existence and after it's gone, your life becomes lifeless like leaves do in Autumn. Amna Dhanani has continued the story from where she had left in her debut poetry book My Existence Craves Yours, giving every poem a special place in the flow once more, although You were the Soul to my Existence contains many different elements like heartbreaks of many kinds, traumatic childhood, infinite love in finite time, hardships, self-healing and growth.	190	September 1st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52754188-you-were-the-soul-to-my-existence
