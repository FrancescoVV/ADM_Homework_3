The Information		Martin Amis	3.51	6709	305	Fame, envy, lust, violence, intrigues literary and criminal - they're all here in The Information . How does one writer hurt another writer? This is the question novelist Richard Tull mills over, for his friend Gwyn Barry has become a darling of book buyers, award committees, and TV interviewers, even as Tull himself sinks deeper into the sub-basement of literary failure. The only way out of this predicament, Tull believes, is to plot the demise of Barry. "With The Information , Amis delivers a portrait of middle-age realignment with more verbal felicity and unbridled reach than [anyone] since Tom Wolfe forged Bonfire of the Vanities ."Â— Houston Chronicle	374	1995	Richard Tull, Gwyn Barry, Gina Tull, Lady Demeter de Rougemount, Steve Cousins, Gal Aplanalp	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/380017.The_Information
