Keep the Faith Vol.1 on Education		Kevin Swanson	4.53	15	3	If there is one thing that we ought to re-examine in light of the decline of the Christian faith and the ongoing generational apostasy, it is this matter of education. It is time to get back to the drawing board, and ask the basic questions concerning the philosophy of education and child training. Now more than ever, we need to examine the wisdom of previous generations, particularly the teaching of those genuine Christian pastors and leaders who lived before the demise of the Christian West. If we would keep the faith for future generations, it would be prudent to root ourselves more solidly in the godly wisdom of previous centuries.Featuring original source quotations from church fathers such as Clement, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Ignatius, Barnabas, Lanctantius, Didache, Eusebius, Jerome, Chrysostom, Augustine, Bede, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Richard Baxter, Increase Mather, John Wesley, A.A.
