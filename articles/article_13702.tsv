Barabbas		Pär Lagerkvist, Alan Blair, Lucien Maury, André Gide	3.84	4063	389	Barabbas is the acquitted; the man whose life was exchanged for that of Jesus of Nazareth, crucified upon the hill of Golgotha. Barabbas is a man condemned to have no god. "Christos Iesus" is carved on the disk suspended from his neck, but he cannot affirm his faith. He cannot pray. He can only say, "I want to believe." Translated from Swedish by Alan Blair.	144	1950	Barabbas	Judea, Jerusalem (Israel), Rome (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12890.Barabbas
