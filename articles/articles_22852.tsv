Camping Killers: Cultists		Oliver Oyanadel	5.00	1	1	A teenager finds himself in a vigilante religious cult who lure and murder evil doers. It's symbolically based on the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, with a spiritual lesson to take away from it. Action packed thriller with a deep message. A book report on this particular novel would give your kid genius credibility over night. It was written with a lot of room for analysis, and the book report format was kept in mind. It's book report friendly, if you will. Very easy to read conversational narration with comfortable dialog, making complex ideas sink in innately. It contains instructions on how to strengthen your compassion and humility within the story the way there are secrets in the torah. This is my masterpiece. Get a copy for your high schooler. No requirements necessary. ~Oliver.	127	July 19th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42862719-the-book-of-the-living
