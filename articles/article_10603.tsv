Monster: The Rebirth of Finnegan Sloane		Geneva Jameson, Tara Melendez	3.80	5	1	Finnegan Sloane is a monster. She hates what she is. She hates the one who made her even more. She never asked to be this. The thought of revenge consumes her every waking moment. She never meant for her sister to get involved. She never meant for her friends to start dying. But she's finally found her maker after years of searching. She's going to make him pay for what he did to her. Even if it means dying a painful second death.	434	October 14th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9527985-monster
