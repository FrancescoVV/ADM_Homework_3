Redwall #19	Brian Jacques, David Elliot	4.09	7091	137	Lord Asheye of Salamandastron, now old and blind, has a prophecy: a new Badger Lord must take his place and reign over the legendary badger fortress. But who is this young warrior who 'shuns both armour and sword'? And how is he to be found? Mad Maudie, a feisty haremaid of the Long Patrol, is just the one to do the job. Meanwhile, the unsuspecting future Badger Lord has been captured by an unscrupulous group of Sea Raiders led by the infamous fox, Vizka Longtooth, intent on conquering Redwall Abbey. It is up to our young badger hero to defend Redwall so that he may fulfill his destiny as leader of Salamandastron.
