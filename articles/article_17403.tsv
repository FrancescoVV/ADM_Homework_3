Exodus Code	Torchwood #19	John Barrowman, Carole E. Barrowman	3.86	711	103	It starts with a series of unexplained events. Earth tremors across the globe. People being driven insane by their heightened and scrambled senses. And the world is starting to notice - the number one Twitter trend is #TheLoco. Governments and scientists are bewildered and silent. The world needs Torchwood, but there's not much of Torchwood left. Captain Jack has tracked the problem to its source: a village in Peru, where he's uncovered evidence of alien involvement. Back in Cardiff, Gwen Cooper has discovered something lurking inside the Torchwood software - something alien and somehow connected to Jack. If the world is to be restored, she has to warn him - but she's quickly becoming a victim of the madness, too!	366	September 13th 2012	Jack Harkness, Gwen Cooper, Police Sergeant Andy Davidson	Cardiff, Wales (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14459126-exodus-code
