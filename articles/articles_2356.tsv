Maurice		E.M. Forster	4.04	28135	1807	Maurice is heartbroken over unrequited love, which opened his heart and mind to his own sexual identity. In order to be true to himself, he goes against the grain of societyâ€™s often unspoken rules of class, wealth, and politics. Forster understood that his homage to same-sex love, if published when he completed it in 1914, would probably end his career. Thus, Maurice languished in a drawer for fifty-seven years, the author requesting it be published only after his death (along with his stories about homosexuality later collected in The Life to Come ). Since its release in 1971, Maurice has been widely read and praised. It has been, and continues to be, adapted for major stage productions, including the 1987 Oscar-nominated film adaptation starring Hugh Grant and James Wilby.	256	1971	Maurice Hall, Alec Scudder, Clive Durham, Mr Borenius, Archie London, Mr Lasker Jones, Mrs Durham, Simcox, Mrs Wetherall, Miss Tonks, Mr Fetherstonhaugh, Mr Ayres, Ada Hall, Kitty Hall, Aunt Ida, Anne Woods, Risley, Ben Ducie, Fred Scudder, Mrs Ducie, Mr Scudder, Mrs Scudder, Dr Barry	London, England (United Kingdom), Southampton, England, Cambridge University, England, British Museum, London, England , 1912, British Museum, London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3103.Maurice
