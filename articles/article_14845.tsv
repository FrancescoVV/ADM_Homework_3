Dying to Meet You	43 Old Cemetery Road #1	Kate Klise, M. Sarah Klise	4.02	7815	925	Enter at your own risk: You might just DIE laughing. The best-selling author Ignatius B. Grumply moves into the Victorian mansion at 43 Old Cemetery Road, hoping to find some peace and quiet so that he can crack a wicked case of writer's block. But 43 Old Cemetery Road is already occupied--by an eleven-year-old boy named Seymour, his cat, Shadow, and an irritable ghost named Olive. And they have no intention of sharing!	155	April 6th 2009	Ignatius B. Grumply, Anita Sale, E. Gadds, Paige Turner, Seymour Hope, Frank N. Beans, Olive C.
