Swann's Way	À la recherche du temps perdu #1	Marcel Proust, Lydia Davis	4.12	47729	3584	Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time is one of the most entertaining reading experiences in any language and arguably the finest novel of the twentieth century. But since its original prewar translation there has been no completely new version in English. Now, Penguin brings Proust's masterpiece to new audiences throughout the world, beginning with Lydia Davis's internationally acclaimed translation of the first volume, Swann's Way . Swann's Way is one of the preeminent novels of childhood: a sensitive boy's impressions of his family and neighbors, all brought dazzlingly back to life years later by the taste of a madeleine. It also enfolds the short novel "Swann in Love," an incomparable study of sexual jealousy that becomes a crucial part of the vast, unfolding structure of In Search of Lost Time . The first volume of the work that established Proust as one of the finest voices of the modern age — satirical, skeptical, confiding, and endlessly varied in its response to the human condition — Swann's Way also stands on its own as a perfect rendering of a life in art, of the past re-created through memory.	444	November 14th 1913	Narrator/Marcel, Baron de Charlus, Mme Swann, Gilberte Swann, Cottard, Odette de Crécy, Charles Swann, Françoise de Combray, Madame Verdurin	France, Combray (France), Balbec (France), Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12749.Swann_s_Way
