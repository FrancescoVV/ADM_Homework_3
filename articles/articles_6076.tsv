The Cherry Orchard		Anton Chekhov, Tom    Murphy	3.68	29575	1108	Published to tie in with the world premiere at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. In Chekhov's tragi-comedy - perhaps his most popular play - the Gayev family is torn by powerful forces, forces rooted deep in history, and in the society around them. Their estate is hopelessly in debt: urged to cut down their beautiful cherry orchard and sell the land for holiday cottages, they struggle to act decisively. Tom Murphy's fine vernacular version allows us to re-imagine the events of the play in the last days of Anglo-Irish colonialism. It gives this great play vivid new life within our own history and social consciousness.	96	1903	Anya Andreyevna Ranevskaya, Varia, fiica adoptiva a Ranevskaiei, Gaev Leonid Andreevici, fratele Ranevskaiei, Lopahin Iermolai Alexeevici, negustor, Trofimov Piotr Sergheevici, student, Simeonov-Piscik Boris Borisovici, mosier, Charlotta Ivanovna, guvernanta, Epihodov Simion Panteleevici, contabil, Duniasa, fata in casa, Firs, lacheu, Iasa, tinar lacheu, Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya	Russian Federation, Moscow (Russian Federation)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87346.The_Cherry_Orchard
