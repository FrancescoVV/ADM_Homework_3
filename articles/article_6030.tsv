Tall, Dark & Hungry	Argeneau #4	Lynsay Sands	4.20	18181	537	It bites: New York hotels cost an arm and a leg, and Terri had flown from England to help plan her cousinâ€™s wedding. The new in-laws offered lodging. But they were a weird bunch. There was the sometimes-chipper-sometimes-brooding Lucern, and the wacky stage-actor, Vincent. (She couldn't imagine Broadway casting a hungrier singing-and-dancing Dracula.) And then there was Bastien. Just looking into his eyes, Terri had to admit she was falling for him - someone even taller, darker and hungrier than the other two. She was feeling a mite peckish herself. And if she stayed with him, those blood-sucking hotel owners wouldn't get to her!	372	July 1st 2004	Terri Lea Simpson, Bastien Argeneau	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387061.Tall_Dark_Hungry
