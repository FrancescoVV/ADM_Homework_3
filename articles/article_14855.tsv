Forced by civil war to leave his beguiling mistress Cleopatra, Caesar turns his eye to the future: who is to inherit the throne of Roman power? But in the shadows of the empire, the talk is of murder. Who among his associates has the cunning and skill to fell the fierce leader -- and brave the dangerous consequences of that cataclysmic act?	1110	November 26th 2002	Gaius Cassius Longinus, Brutus, Cleopatra, Marcus Agrippa, Marcus Antonius, Augustus, Julius Caesar, Marcus Tullius Cicero	Alexandria (Egypt), Rome (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3421.The_October_Horse
