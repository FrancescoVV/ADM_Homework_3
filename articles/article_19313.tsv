The Da Vinci Code (the Young Adult Adaptation)		Dan Brown	4.52	5255	54	Dan Brown's mega-bestseller is now available for a new generation of readers. This young adult adaptation takes readers from Paris to London on a breathless tour of famous landmarks and will remind fans everywhere why the New York Times calls The Da Vinci Code blockbuster perfection. "The greatest conspiracy of the past two thousand years is about to unravel." Robert Langdon, professor of religious symbology at Harvard, is in Paris to give a lecture. At the reception that follows, he is scheduled to meet with a revered curator from the world-famous Louvre museum. But the curator never shows up, and later that night Langdon is awakened by authorities and told that the curator has been found dead. He is then taken to the Louvre the scene of the crime where he finds out that baffling clues have been left behind. Thus begins a race against time, as Robert Langdon becomes a suspect and, with the help of French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, must decipher a mystifying trail of clues that the two come to realize have been left specifically for them. If Robert and Sophie cannot solve the puzzle in time, an ancient truth could be lost forever and they themselves might end up as collateral damage.	460	March 28th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30228538-the-da-vinci-code
