Faction Paradox: The Book of the War	Faction Paradox #0	Lawrence Miles, Simon Bucher-Jones, Daniel O’Mahony, Ian McIntire, Mags L. Halliday, Helen Fayle, Philip Purser-Hallard, Kelly Hale, Jonathan Dennis, Mark Clapham, Jim Calafiore	4.41	108	4	A stand-alone novel in alphabetical order… Before the Faction Paradox series from Image Comics, there was the War in Heaven—a wide-ranging conflict between the immovable Great Houses, the renegade Faction Paradox and other major powers. All of them possess time-travel technology—and all of them are trying to usurp various points in history, thus erasing their opponents from the timestream. Marking the first five decades of the cosmic-spanning conflict, The Book of the War is an A to Z self-contained complete guide to the Spiral Politic, from the beginning of recorded time to the fall of humanity. This book chronicles the rise of the Faction as a renegade House, the creation of a living timeship named Compassion, some brutal battles across all of time and space and more. All in all, The Book of the War serves as the No. 1 entry point into the Faction Paradox novel and comic lines.	256	September 17th 2002	Compassion, Chris Cwej, Faction Paradox		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1228814.Faction_Paradox
