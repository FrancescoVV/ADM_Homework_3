Control	Songs of Submission #4	C.D. Reiss	4.24	9212	472	What you’re breaking isn’t some little, meaningless coupling. We aren’t some casual fuck, and we never were. Not from the first night. Not from the first time I laid eyes on you. You were built for me. I denied it as long as I could, but we were meant to be together. You are the sea under my sky. We’re bound at the horizon.	158	May 10th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17833834-control
