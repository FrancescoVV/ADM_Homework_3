Chasm City	Revelation Space #0.3	Alastair Reynolds	4.14	20632	810	The once-utopian Chasm City -a doomed human settlement on an otherwise inhospitable planet- has been overrun by a virus known as the Melding Plague, capable of infecting any body, organic or computerized. Now, with the entire city corrupted -from the people to the very buildings they inhabit- only the most wretched sort of existence remains. For security operative Tanner Mirabel, it is the landscape of nightmares through which he searches for a low-life postmortal killer. But the stakes are raised when his search brings him face to face with a centuries-old atrocity that history would rather forget.	694	May 2001	Sky Haussmann, Tanner Mirabel		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89185.Chasm_City
