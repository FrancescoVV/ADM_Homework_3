Devil in the Details: Scenes from an Obsessive Girlhood		Jennifer Traig	3.56	4259	492	DEVIL IN THE DETAILS announces Jennifer Traig as one of the most hilarious writers to emerge in recent years and one of the strangest! Recalling the agony of growing up obsessive compulsive and a religious fanatic, Traig fearlessly confesses the most peculiar behavior like tirelessly scrubbing her hands for a full half hour before dinner, feeding her stuffed animals before herself, and washing everything she owned because she thought it was contaminated by pork fumes. The result is a book so relentlessly funny and frank, it's totally refreshing.	242	January 1st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86830.Devil_in_the_Details
