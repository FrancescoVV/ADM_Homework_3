Talk Nerdy to Me	Nerds #5	Vicki Lewis Thompson	3.79	1704	103	Fashion model Eve Dupree is fed up with being labeled "the pretty one" while her sister's called a genius. Eve's got loads of brilliant ideas, not the least of which is the invention she's building in her garage. But when she turns to the nerd next door to help get it off the ground, she finds herself on dangerous ground. Charlie Shepherd has discovered that there's more to Eve than meets the eye. But it's not just her body he likes--it's those sexy brains of hers. Romance is a complication he doesn't need right now. The problem is, she has something he needs and he can't seem to resist her. Keeping her creation under wraps is harder than Eve expected--as is denying her attraction to Charlie. But when a saboteur starts sniffing around her project, she questions everyone around her, even her nerd in shining armor. Can opposites attract or will they ignite a fire they can't control?	357	February 7th 2006		Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630020.Talk_Nerdy_to_Me
