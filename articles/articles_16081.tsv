The Naming of the Dead	Inspector Rebus #16	Ian Rankin	4.01	10442	484	The sixteenth Inspector Rebus novel from 'Britain's No.1 crime writer' DAILY MIRROR. A murder has been committed - but as the victim was a rapist, recently released from prison, no one is too concerned about the crime. That is, until Detective Inspector John Rebus and DS Siobhan Clarke uncover evidence that a serial killer is on the loose ... When Rebus also starts looking into the apparent suicide of an MP, he is abruptly warned off the case, not least because the G8 leaders have gathered in Scotland, and Rebus's bosses want him well out of the way. But Rebus has never been one to stick to the rules, and when Siobhan has a very personal reason for hunting down a riot cop, it looks as though both Rebus and Clarke may be up against their own side ...	517	2006	Inspector John Rebus	Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69800.The_Naming_of_the_Dead
