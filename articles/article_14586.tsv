Roxaboxen		Alice McLerran, Barbara Cooney	4.41	5501	360	From two-time Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator Barbara Cooney and celebrated children’s book author Alice McLerran comes Roxaboxen, a treasured story about the magic of a child’s imagination. This picture book is an excellent choice to share during homeschooling, in particular for children ages 4 to 6. It’s a fun way to learn to read and as a supplement for activity books for children. Marian called it Roxboxen. There across the road, it looked like any rocky hill—nothing but sand and rocks, and some old wooden boxes. But it was a special place. And all children needed to go there was a long stick and a soaring imagination. “A celebration of the transforming magic of the imagination. An original.” —ALA Booklist	32	April 22nd 1991		Arizona (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334809.Roxaboxen
