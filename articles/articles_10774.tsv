Futures and Frosting	Chocolate Lovers #2	Tara Sivec	4.27	24500	1849	Carter, Claire and Gavin have formed the perfect little family. Their friends are getting married and everyone is growing up, maturing and ready to face the future. Or are they? From bachelorette party hell, porn addictions, dinner roll baseball and botched wedding proposals to finding out everyone's extended family is chock full of crazy, Carter and Claire begin to question the strength of the ties that bind them. Unfortunately, these ties have nothing to do with fuzzy handcuffs and everything to do with the mounting differences between them. Will their friends make a mess of things with their inappropriate comments and need to know everything, or will they convince the couple that happily-ever-after sometimes really can start with beer pong?	321	September 13th 2012	Jenny, Carter, Claire Amadeus, Liz, Jim, Gavin, Drew	Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23016364-futures-and-frosting
