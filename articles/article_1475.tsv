The Forest of Hands and Teeth	The Forest of Hands and Teeth #1	Carrie Ryan	3.59	81467	8812	In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent. And you must always mind the fence that surrounds the village; the fence that protects the village from the Forest of Hands and Teeth. But, slowly, Mary’s truths are failing her. She’s learning things she never wanted to know about the Sisterhood and its secrets, and the Guardians and their power, and about the Unconsecrated and their relentlessness. When the fence is breached and her world is thrown into chaos, she must choose between her village and her future—between the one she loves and the one who loves her. And she must face the truth about the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Could there be life outside a world surrounded by so much death?	310	March 10th 2009	Mary, Travis, Harry Adams, Cass, Jed		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3432478-the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth
