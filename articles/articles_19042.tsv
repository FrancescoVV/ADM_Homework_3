Not the Faintest Trace	Sergeant Frank Hardy #1	Wendy M. Wilson	3.85	406	52	In a New Zealand you never knew existed, the after effects of the brutal Land Wars are still being felt in a small Scandinavian settlement, from which two young men have disappeared without a trace. THE TARANAKI WARS, NEW ZEALAND, 1869: AN ATROCITY After arriving too late to stop the beheading of a rebel Maori chief by colonial troops looking for a bounty, and witnessing other events that sicken him, Sergeant Frank Hardy leaves the military to look for a place where he can carve out a life for himself. MANAWATU, NEW ZEALAND, 1877: SERGEANT HARDY INVESTIGATES Eight years after the war has ended, Hardy works as a mail coach driver and part-time private investigator, but canâ€™t forget the horrors he witnessed during the Land Wars. When he is attacked by a vengeful Maori warrior while searching for the bodies of two missing Scandinavian men, he begins to wonder if his past has caught up with him. And to complicate things, a Scandinavian road worker is out to get him and the Armed Constabulary are looking at him suspiciously. Will his growing love for a young Danish woman bring him peace, or will he suffer the same fate as other men from his regiment, the 57th Regiment of Foot, known as the Die Hards? And will he ever return the bodies of the missing Scandi men to their grieving families?	287	January 4th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37849013-not-the-faintest-trace
