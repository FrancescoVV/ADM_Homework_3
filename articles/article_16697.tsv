When The Dust Settles - A True Hollywood Story	True Hollywood Stories	John A. Andrews	3.80	15	4	In life there are movers, shakers and detonators. Men made with that extra ordinary quality, and would not be denied of their rightful place in society. They seem to have what some may call "iron in their blood" and are driven by that steel-like-will-not-be-denied quality to succeed against all odds. We've not only seen this extra-ness demonstrated in a man's athletic ability but also in every combative situation in which their involvement occurred.	200	May 9th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10105221-when-the-dust-settles---i-am-still-standing
