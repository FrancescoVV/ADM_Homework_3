House of Glass	Tetralogi Buru #4	Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Max Lane	4.31	3564	283	With House Of Glass comes the final chapter of Pramoedya's epic quartet, set in the Dutch East Indies at the turn of the century. A novel of heroism, passion, and betrayal, it provides a spectacular conclusion to a series hailed as one of the great works of modern literature. At the start of House of Glass , Minke, writer and leader of the dissident movement, is now imprisoned--and the narrative has switched to Pangemanann, a former policeman, who has the task of spying and reporting on those who continue the struggle for independence. But the hunter is becoming the hunted. Pangemanann is a victim of his own conscience and has come to admire his adversaries. He must decide whether the law is to safeguard the rights of the people or to control the people. He fears the loss of his position, his family, and his self-respect. At last Pangemanann sees that his true opponents are not Minke and his followers, but rather the dynamism and energy of a society awakened.	384	1988	Minke, Jacques Pangemanann		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174442.House_of_Glass
