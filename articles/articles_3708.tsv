The Inheritance of Loss		Kiran Desai	3.43	47555	4002	In a crumbling, isolated house at the foot of Mount Kanchenjunga in the Himalayas lives an embittered judge who wants only to retire in peace, when his orphaned granddaughter, Sai, arrives on his doorstep. The judge’s cook watches over her distractedly, for his thoughts are often on his son, Biju, who is hopscotching from one gritty New York restaurant to another. Kiran Desai’s brilliant novel, published to huge acclaim, is a story of joy and despair. Her characters face numerous choices that majestically illuminate the consequences of colonialism as it collides with the modern world.	357	2005	Jemubhai Patel	Kalimpong (India)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95186.The_Inheritance_of_Loss
