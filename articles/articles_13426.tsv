Cuts Like An Angel	Cuts Like an Angel #1	Mason Sabre, Lucian Bane	4.52	335	138	He never called the helplines. The one time he did, it was to say goodbye ... to anybody, before leaving the world. Rosie … that was her name. She’d given it when she wasn’t supposed to. She said things that made him burn to live. And he would. He’d find a way to hide his darkness so that he could dance with her, just a single dance, in the liquid sunshine of her laugh. And maybe … maybe he’d taste her. But only once.	426	August 28th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31179729-cuts-like-an-angel
