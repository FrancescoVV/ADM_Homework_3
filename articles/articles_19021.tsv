Brown Girl in a White Country		Anita Vikram	2.60	5	1	"Our narratives are buried in mainstream, tossed aside because our stories don’t quite fit a mold that exists. So it’s time to create a new box for ourselves." In her debut memoir BROWN GIRL IN A WHITE COUNTRY, Anita Vikram depicts the experience of growing up as a South Asian American in the United States. From mental health to sexual violence, Vikram depicts a variety of topics through the lens of a girl longing for happiness and fulfillment.	79	April 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39700953-brown-girl-in-a-white-country
