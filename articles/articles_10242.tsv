The Story of Lucy Gault		William Trevor	3.76	6245	637	The stunning new novel from highly acclaimed author William Trevor is a brilliant, subtle, and moving story of love, guilt, and forgiveness. The Gault family leads a life of privilege in early 1920s Ireland, but the threat of violence leads the parents of nine-year-old Lucy to decide to leave for England, her mother's home. Lucy cannot bear the thought of leaving Lahardane, their country house with its beautiful land and nearby beach, and a dog she has befriended. On the day before they are to leave, Lucy runs away, hoping to convince her parents to stay. Instead, she sets off a series of tragic misunderstandings that affect all of Lahardane's inhabitants for the rest of their lives.	240	January 1st 2002	Lucy Gault, Everard Gault, Heloise Gault	County Cork (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/167302.The_Story_of_Lucy_Gault
