Written by the author of The Wishing Flower, The Magic of Laven-Rock is a delightful fairy tale adventure where children learn that sharing is much better than fighting, and that people throughout the world are not so very different than themselves.	68	August 30th 2008		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5902379-the-magic-of-laven-rock
