Firefly Summer		Maeve Binchy	3.91	13416	436	Every summer the four Ryan children play in the ruins of Fernscourt, the once-grand house on the bank of the river. But when the estate is bought by Patrick O’Neill, the wealthy Irish American, his grand plans for its development threaten to shatter the peace. A new luxury hotel promises to breathe new life into the village, and yet it could also spell disaster for the Ryan family. And as old values and traditions begin to crumble away, no-one – not even Patrick – can predict what his big dreams will do to the heart of their quiet village.	928	1987	Kate Ryan, John Ryan, Patrick O'Neill, Fergus Slattery	Mountfern (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40611380-firefly-summer
