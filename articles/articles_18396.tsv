After Midnight	Black Phoenix #1	Sarah Grimm	3.75	1156	143	Thirteen years — that's how long Isabeau Montgomery has been living a lie. After an automobile accident took her mother's life, Izzy hid herself away, surviving the only way she knew how. Now she is happy in her carefully reconstructed life. That is until he walks through the door of her bar... Black Phoenix singer/front man Noah Clark came to Long Island City with a goal — one that doesn't include an instant, electric attraction to the dark-haired beauty behind the bar. Coaxing her into his bed won't be easy, but he can't get her pale, haunted eyes nor her skill on the piano out of his head. Can Noah help Isabeau overcome the past? Or will her need to protect her secret force her back into hiding and destroy their chance at happiness?	242	September 27th 2011	Nick Saunders, Noah Clark, Dominic Price, Thomas Cahill Sr., Alex Morgan, Isabeau Montgomery		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18810929-after-midnight
