Magic Bites	Kate Daniels #1	Ilona Andrews	4.05	105615	6939	The world has suffered a magic apocalypse. We pushed the technological progress too far, and now magic returned with a vengeance. It comes in waves, without warning, and vanishes as suddenly as it appears. When magic is up, planes drop out of the sky, cars stall, electricity dies. When magic is down, guns work and spells fail. Atlanta would be a nice place to live, if it weren’t for magic… One moment magic dominates, and cars stall and guns fail. The next, technology takes over and the defensive spells no longer protect your house from monsters. Here skyscrapers topple under onslaught of magic; werebears and werehyenas prowl through the ruined streets; and the Masters of the Dead, necromancers driven by their thirst of knowledge and wealth, pilot blood-crazed vampires with their minds. In this world lives Kate Daniels. Kate likes her sword a little too much and has a hard time controlling her mouth. The magic in her blood makes her a target, and she spent most of her life hiding in plain sight. But when Kate’s guardian is murdered, she must choose to do nothing and remain safe or to pursue his preternatural killer. Hiding is easy, but the right choice is rarely easy…	261	March 27th 2007	Kate Daniels, Curran Lennart, Beatrice "Aunt B", Derek Gaunt, Jim Shrapshire, Saiman, Dr. George Doolittle, Mahon Delany, Ghastek, Rowena (People), Ted Moynohan	Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38619.Magic_Bites
