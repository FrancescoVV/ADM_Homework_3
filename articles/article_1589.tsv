Splintered	Splintered #1	A.G. Howard	3.92	52643	7674	Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers—precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland . Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now. When her mother’s mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice’s tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice’s mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.	371	January 1st 2013	Alyssa Victoria Gardner, Jebediah "Jeb" Holt, Taelor Tremont, Morpheus, Alison Gardner, Thomas Gardner, Jenara Holt, Rabid White, Octobenus, Gossamer, Queen Red, Grenadine, Herman Hattington, March Hairless, Door Mouse, Sister One Twid, Sister Two Twid, Humphrey Dumpty, Ivory Queen	Pleasance, Texas (United States), The Nether Realm/Wonderland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12558285-splintered
