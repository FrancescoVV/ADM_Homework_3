Lord Darnel haunts the dreams of his Princess. The dark ruler of Racah refuses to give up his hunt to return Alyra to his castle where he can control her powers. Tarek holds the truth of his life in Racah with Alyra a well-guarded secret. Despite his reservations, his heart leads him to join Alyraâ€™s journey and protect her from the dangerous drakes. But in the midst of their travels, something greater than either anticipated comes to light between them.
