And when she spots Alex having a tete-a-tete with his ex in a local bar, Angela's dreams of Parisian passion all start crashing down around her. With London and her old life only a train journey away, Angela can't decide if should stay and face the music or run away home!	312	July 8th 2010	Angela Clark, Jenny Lopez, Alex Reid	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7537072-i-heart-paris
