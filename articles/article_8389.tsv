Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking		David Bayles, Ted Orland	3.73	71450	1033	"This is a book about making art. Ordinary art. Ordinary art means something like: all art not made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially-statistically speaking-there aren't any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so, yet good art gets made all the time, so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius." --from the Introduction	122	1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear
