The Well Speaks of Its Own Poison		Maggie  Smith	4.42	191	42	Delving into the depths of fairy tales to transform the daily into encounters with the marvelous but dangerous, Maggie Smith’s poems question whether the realms of imagination and story can possibly be safe. Even as her compressed stories are unfolding on a suburban cul de sac, they are deep in the mythical woods, “where children, despite their commonness, / are a delicacy.”	80	April 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25304410-the-well-speaks-of-its-own-poison
