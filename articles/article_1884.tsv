Dance Dance Dance	The Rat #4	Haruki Murakami	4.04	66196	3675	High-class call girls billed to Mastercard. A psychic 13-year-old dropout with a passion for Talking Heads. A hunky matinee idol doomed to play dentists and teachers. A one-armed beach-combing poet, an uptight hotel clerk and one very bemused narrator caught in the web of advanced capitalist mayhem. Combine this offbeat cast of characters with Murakami's idiosyncratic prose and out comes Dance Dance Dance .	393	October 13th 1988	Yuki, Yomiyoshi, The Sheep Man, Kiki	Tokyo (Japan), Sapporo (Japan), Honolulu, Hawaii (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17800.Dance_Dance_Dance
