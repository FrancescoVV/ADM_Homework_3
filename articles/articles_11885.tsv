Cuckoo Song		Frances Hardinge	3.95	6375	1155	The first things to shift were the doll's eyes, the beautiful grey-green glass eyes. Slowly they swivelled, until their gaze was resting on Triss's face. Then the tiny mouth moved, opened to speak. 'Who do you think you are? This is my family.' When Triss wakes up after an accident, she knows that something is very wrong. She is insatiably hungry; she keeps waking up with leaves in her hair, and her sister seems terrified of her. When it all gets too much and she starts to cry, her tears are like cobwebs... Soon Triss discovers that what happened to her is more strange and terrible than she could ever have imagined, and that she is quite literally not herself. In a quest find the truth she must travel into the terrifying Underbelly of the city to meet a twisted architect who has dark designs on her family - before it's too late...	409	May 8th 2014	Theresa "Triss" Crescent, Penelope "Pen" Crescent, Piers Crescent, Celeste Crescent, Violet Parish, Mr. Grace, The Architect, The Shrike	Ellchester, England, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18298890-cuckoo-song
