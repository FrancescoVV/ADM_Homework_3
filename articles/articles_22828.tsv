The Upside to Being Single		Emma  Hart	3.57	5207	595	If anyone asks, I knew better than to flash my boobs for Mardi Gras beads. I still don’t know why I did it. Maybe it was the dare from my two best friends. Maybe it was the guys on the balcony saying they’d throw Fireball shots with the beads. Or maybe it was the quiet guy in the corner of that same balcony with piercing gray eyes, wavy dark hair, and a smile so tempting I wanted to climb up there and lick it off his face. Maybe it was because I never thought I’d see them again. Not that it matters. Not today. Because the hotel I manage was finally bought—and the guy who walks in and introduces himself as my new boss is Mr. Tall, Dark, and Silent. There are many upsides to being single. Your new boss knowing what your boobs look like? Not one of them. (THE UPSIDE TO BEING SINGLE is a standalone, romantic comedy from the author who brought you MISS FIX-IT and BEING BROOKE.)	192	January 30th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37420706-the-upside-to-being-single
