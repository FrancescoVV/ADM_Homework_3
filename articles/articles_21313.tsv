Beneath the Willow		Michael J.  Murphy	4.29	17	7	During the European summer of 1916, the horror of war spreads its tentacles to grip a working-class family in Balmain, New South Wales. The war has ended, and Clarence Miller carries wounds that cannot be seen. He returns home to a loving wife and infant son, but his life will never be the same again. Together they seek a fresh start in the country, but memories of his trauma near the Northern French village of Fromelles still imprison him. Tragedy strikes and casts a heavy shadow over ensuing generations of the Miller family. A voice from the past and a resolute young woman may be the family's only chance of finding peace.	396	September 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41948764-beneath-the-willow
