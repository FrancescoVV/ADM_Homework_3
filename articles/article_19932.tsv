Elegance		Kathleen Tessaro	3.41	4542	446	Louise C. wants what Jackie O had ... Unhappy with her looks, her life, and her empty marriage, Louise Canova needs help -- and she finds it in a secondhand bookstore. A forty-year-old encyclopedia of style titled Elegance , this slim volume by formidable French fashion expert Madame Dariaux promises to transform even the plainest of women into creatures of poise and grace. It is a fairy godmother in print, an A-to-Z manual with essential advice that Louise vows to take to heart. But within its pages lie not only clues from her past, but also powerful lessons for the future. And as the old Louise gives way to the stunning new, she's about to find out that there's more to every life than what appears on the surface ... and that everything, even elegance, has its price.	390	2003	Louise Canova, Mr. Canova, Penny Shoelace, Mrs. P, Colin Riley, Lisa Finegold, Nancy Finegold, Dr. Finegold, Nicki Sands, Oliver Wendt, Rita Bloom, Ada Riley, Andy Warner, Charlotte Thorne, Robert Brooks, Lady Castle, Poppy North, Frederick Von Hassel, Mrs. Simpson-Stock, Eddie, Lavender, Piers, Mary (Elegance), Mona (Elegance), Dan (Elegance), Sandy (Elegance), Darren (Elegance), Flora (Elegance)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107611.Elegance
