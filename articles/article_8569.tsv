QB VII		Leon Uris	4.19	28544	459	In Queen’s Bench Courtroom Number Seven, famous author Abraham Cady stands trial. In his book The Holocaust —born of the terrible revelation that the Jadwiga Concentration Camp was the site of his family’s extermination—Cady shook the consciousness of the human race. He also named eminent surgeon Sir Adam Kelno as one of Jadwiga’s most sadistic inmate/doctors. Kelno has denied this and brought furious charges. Now unfolds Leon Uris’s riveting courtroom drama—one of the great fictional trials of the century.	432	January 1st 1970			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/426825.QB_VII
