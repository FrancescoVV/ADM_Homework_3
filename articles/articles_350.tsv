The Graveyard Book		Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean	4.13	441325	31716	Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a perfectly normal boy. Well, he would be perfectly normal if he didn't live in a graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor the world of the dead. There are dangers and adventures for Bod in the graveyard: the strange and terrible menace of the Sleer; a gravestone entrance to a desert that leads to the city of ghouls; friendship with a witch, and so much more. But it is in the land of the living that real danger lurks, for it is there that the man Jack lives and he has already killed Bod's family. A deliciously dark masterwork by bestselling author Neil Gaiman, with illustrations by award-winning Dave McKean.	307	September 30th 2008	Nobody Owens, the man Jack, Silas, Mr. Owens, Mrs. Owens, Miss Lupescu, Scarlett Perkins, The Sleer, Liza Hempstock		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2213661.The_Graveyard_Book
