Solipsist		Henry Rollins	3.96	1426	78	"I saw the word Solipsist while reading the dictionary in 1993. I was living in NYC at the time and the word defined how the city made me feel. I worked on this book in several cities all over the world until 1996. The writing is obsessive and claustrophobic. To be solipsistic is to totally realize the ego and the nightmare of utter self-possession. I went for it and it swallowed me whole." --Henry Rollins	160	August 10th 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503490.Solipsist
