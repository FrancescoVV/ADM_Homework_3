Fade Away	Myron Bolitar #3	Harlan Coben	4.01	24522	1105	The home was top-notch New Jersey suburban. The living room was Martha Stewart. The basement was Legos—and blood. For sports agent Myron Bolitar, the disappearance of a man he'd once competed against was bringing back memories—of the sport he and Greg Downing had both played and the woman they both loved. Now, among the stars, the wanna-bes, the gamblers and groupies, Myron is unraveling the strange, violent life of a sports hero gone wrong, and coming face-to-face with a past he can't relive, and a present he may not survive. In novels that crackle with wit and suspense, Edgar Award winner Harlan Coben has created one of the most fascinating and complex heroes in suspense fiction—Myron Bolitar—a hotheaded, tenderhearted sports agent who grows more and more engaging and unpredictable with each page-turning appearance.	368	December 11th 1996	Myron Bolitar, Audrey, Clip Arnstein, Greg Downing, Lisa aka Carla, Emily Downing, Jessica Culver, Esperanza Diaz, Windsor "Win" Horne Lockwood, III		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272607.Fade_Away
