Black Butterflies	The Greek Island #1	Sara Alexi	3.81	1396	126	Black Butterflies is the second book in the Greek Village Collection from INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLING AUTHOR Sara Alexi. Black Butterflies is a gripping summer story of love, loss and ultimately forgiveness, leaving you basking in sunshine and suspense as you find yourself transported amongst the sounds, tastes and smells of life on a Greek Island. Marina is a gentle soul who makes a modest living in her corner shop. Her husband died years ago, and her children have grown up. Life is pleasantly predictable, if a little dull. But all is not as it seems, and buried deeply in Marina's younger years is a secret that she has managed to keep hidden...until now. Even her daughters don't know about the lonely months spent on a nearby island thirty five years ago, with the events from that summer haunting her ever since. When Marina discovers one of her daughters wants to move to the same island, she realises that past and present threaten to collide with dreadful consequences. Reluctantly, yet without doubt, Marina knows she must revisit the island. Armed with nothing but a vague plan and a determination to stop the looming tragedy, she will come face to face with the consequences of her long kept secret, but will she be in time? Confronting a past steeped in the intolerance and prejudice of those around her, Marina's roller-coaster journey will make you laugh, cry and eagerly hold out for one woman's redemption.	278	2012		Greece	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29685545-black-butterflies
