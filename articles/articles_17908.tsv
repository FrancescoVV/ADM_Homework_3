Tunneling to the Center of the Earth: Stories		Kevin    Wilson	4.10	2383	364	Kevin Wilson's characters inhabit a world that moves seamlessly between the real and the imagined, the mundane and the fantastic. "Grand Stand-In" is narrated by an employee of a Nuclear Family Supplemental Providerâ€”a company that supplies "stand-ins" for families with deceased, ill, or just plain mean grandparents. And in "Blowing Up On the Spot," a young woman works sorting tiles at a Scrabble factory after her parents have spontaneously combusted. Southern gothic at its best, laced with humor and pathos, these wonderfully inventive stories explore the relationship between loss and death and the many ways we try to cope with both.	224	March 25th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4015864-tunneling-to-the-center-of-the-earth
