The School for Good and Evil	The School for Good and Evil #1	Soman Chainani, Iacopo Bruno	4.02	65118	7491	The first kidnappings happened two hundred years before. Some years it was two boys taken, some years two girls, sometimes one of each. But if at first the choices seemed random, soon the pattern became clear. One was always beautiful and good, the child every parent wanted as their own. The other was homely and odd, an outcast from birth. An opposing pair, plucked from youth and spirited away. This year, best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go: the fabled School for Good & Evil, where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil. But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication.. But what if the mistake is actually the first clue to discovering who Sophie and Agatha really are…?	544	May 14th 2013	Agatha (SFGAE), Sophie (SFGAE), School Master (SFGAE), Chaddick (SFGAE), Professor Clarissa Dovey (SFGAE), Merlin (SFGAE), Hester (SFGAE), Anadil (SFGAE), Dot (SFGAE), Tedros (SFGAE), Hort (SFGAE), Beatrix (SFGAE), Kiko (SFGAE), Nicholas (SFGAE), Mona (SFGAE), Leonora Lesso (SFGAE), August Sader (SFGAE), Arachne (SFGAE), Professor Emma Anemone (SFGAE), Professor Bilious Manley (SFGAE), Professor Aleksander Lukas (SFGAE), Professor Sheeba Sheeks (SFGAE), Yuba the Gnome (SFGAE), Professor Rumi Espada (SFGAE), Princess Uma (SFGAE), Castor the Dog (SFGAE), Pollux the Dog (SFGAE), Reaper Cat (SFGAE), Callis (SFGAE), Stefan (SFGAE), Radley (SFGAE)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42080479-the-school-for-good-and-evil
