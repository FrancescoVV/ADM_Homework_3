The Art of Seducing a Naked Werewolf	Naked Werewolf #2	Molly Harper	4.01	9037	677	Baring It All Generations of werewolves have been secretly residing in a secluded valley a stone’s throw from Grundy, Alaska. So when a snooping Outsider comes to Grundy to investigate rumors of lycanthropic shenanigans in the area, the valley’s pack alpha, Maggie Graham, resolves to chase him away, even if doing so takes a quick bite on the butt. What a pity that researcher Nick Thatcher turns out to be so drool-worthy, and that his kisses make Maggie want to sit up and beg. Maggie just can’t seem to convince Nick to leave . . . and even worse, she can’t convince herself to stay away from him. Cross-species dating is problem enough for a harried alpha female, but on top of that, a rival group of werewolves is trying to move into the valley. With interpack war threatening, Maggie can’t afford to be distracted. Combining romance and a career can be tough for anyone; for a werewolf in love with a human, it may be disastrous. . . .	336	March 29th 2011	Mo Duvall-Wenstein, Cooper Graham, Nick Thatcher, Maggie Graham	Alaska (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8525631-the-art-of-seducing-a-naked-werewolf
