Rapture of the Deep: Being an Account of the Further Adventures of Jacky Faber, Soldier, Sailor, Mermaid, Spy	Bloody Jack #7	L.A. Meyer	4.26	6092	397	On the very day that Jacky Faber is to wed her true love, she is kidnapped by British Naval Intelligence and forced to embark on yet another daring mission—this time to search for sunken Spanish gold. But when Jacky is involved, things don't always go as planned. Jacky has survived battles on the high seas, the stifling propriety of a Boston finishing school, and even confinement in a dank French prison. But no adventure has quite matched her opportunistic street-urchin desires—until now.	454	January 1st 2009	Jacky Faber, James Emerson "Jaimy" Fletcher, John Higgins, Mairead Delaney, Lord Richard Allen, Amy Trevelyne, Ezra Pickering, Davy Jones, Flaco Jimenez, Juan Carlos, Daniel Prescott		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6024712-rapture-of-the-deep
