The House at Riverton		Kate Morton	3.94	103607	8199	The House at Riverton is a gorgeous debut novel set in England between the wars. Perfect for fans of "Downton Abbey," it's the story of an aristocratic family, a house, a mysterious death, and a way of life that vanished forever, told in flashback by a woman who witnessed it all. The novel is full of secrets - some revealed, others hidden forever, reminiscent of the romantic suspense of Daphne du Maurier. It's also a meditation on memory and the devastation of war and a beautifully rendered window into a fascinating time in history.	599	2006	Grace Bradley, Hannah Hartford, Emmeline Hartford, Robbie Hunter	Riverton Manor (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1278752.The_House_at_Riverton
