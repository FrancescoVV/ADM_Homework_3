Swastika Night		Katharine Burdekin, Daphne Patai, Anne-Sylvie Homassel	3.63	1850	231	Published in 1937, twelve years before Orwell's 1984 , Swastika Night projects a totally male-controlled fascist world that has eliminated women as we know them. Women are breeders, kept as cattle, while men in this post-Hitlerian world are embittered automatons, fearful of all feelings, having abolished all history, education, creativity, books, and art. The plot centers on a “misfit” who asks, “How could this have happened?”	208	1937		Munich (München) (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387373.Swastika_Night
