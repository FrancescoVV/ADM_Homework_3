Desert Magnolia		Dedra L. Stevenson	4.48	21	11	From the metropolitan streets of Dubai, Daniella is called back to her family home in the American South to help a family that threw her away many years ago. Going back will mean digging up skeletons from her past that she'd hoped to bury forever, but someone murdered her father, and skeletons don't like living in closets.
