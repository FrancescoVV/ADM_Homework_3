A Morbid Taste for Bones	Chronicles of Brother Cadfael #1	Ellis Peters	3.97	33907	1602	Ellis Peters' introduction to the murderous medieval world of Brother Cadfael... A Morbid Taste for Bones In the remote Welsh mountain village of Gwytherin lies the grave of Saint Winifred. Now, in 1137, the ambitious head of Shrewsbury Abbey has decided to acquire the sacred remains for his Benedictine order. Native Welshman Brother Cadfael is sent on the expedition to translate and finds the rustic villagers of Gwytherin passionately divided by the Benedictine's offer for the saint's relics. Canny, wise, and all too wordly, he isn't surprised when this taste for bones leads to bloody murder. The leading opponent to moving the grave has been shot dead with a mysterious arrow, and some say Winifred herself held the bow. Brother Cadfael knows a carnal hand did the killing. But he doesn't know that his plan to unearth a murderer may dig up a case of love and justice...where the wages of sin may be scandal or Cadfael's own ruin.	197	1977	Brother Cadfael, Brother Jerome, Prior Robert Pennant, Abbot Heribert, Brother John, Brother Columbanus, Father Huw, Rhisiart, Sioned, Engelard, Peredur, Bened, Annest	Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England (United Kingdom), Gwytherin, Wales (United Kingdom), Wales, United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321545.A_Morbid_Taste_for_Bones
