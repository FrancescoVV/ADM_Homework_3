Reflected in You	Crossfire #2	Sylvia Day	4.32	311531	10378	Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine . My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. Weâ€™d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...	338	October 2nd 2012	Gideon Cross, Eva Tramell		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14622962-reflected-in-you
