Just One Day	Just One Day #1	Gayle Forman	3.99	78443	8075	A breathtaking journey toward self-discovery and true love, from the author of If I Stay. When sheltered American good girl Allyson "LuLu" Healey first meets laid-back Dutch actor Willem De Ruiter at an underground performance of Twelfth Night in England, there's an undeniable spark. After just one day together, that spark bursts into a flame, or so it seems to Allyson, until the following morning, when she wakes up after a whirlwind day in Paris to discover that Willem has left. Over the next year, Allyson embarks on a journey to come to terms with the narrow confines of her life, and through Shakespeare, travel, and a quest for her almost-true-love, to break free of those confines.	369	January 8th 2013	Allyson Healey, Willem De Ruiter	Paris (France), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Utrecht (Netherlands), United States of America London, England (United Kingdom), United States of America, London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623975-just-one-day
