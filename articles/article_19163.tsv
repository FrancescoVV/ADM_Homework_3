Not For Public Consumption		Frank P. Lipton	4.54	39	11	Not for Public Consumption tells the story about life on the edge. Satirical, twisted, and filled with psychological intrigue, it seeks to unravel the mystery of just where it is that normalcy ends and madness begins. Come and see the world through the eyes of those who have "opted-out." Embedded within the Bizarro-World of San Francisco's Underground, the book follows the life of Murray Y. Bardos, a man who has a lot of secrets (including his penchant for incessant toilet plunging in the middle of the night). Does he have something to hide, or is he truly crazy? And, if he is crazy, was it by choice?	287	February 18th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2400864.Not_For_Public_Consumption
