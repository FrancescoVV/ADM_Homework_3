Ham on Rye		Charles Bukowski	4.14	83907	3524	In what is widely hailed as the best of his many novels, Charles Bukowski details the long, lonely years of his own hardscrabble youth in the raw voice of alter ego Henry Chinaski. From a harrowingly cheerless childhood in Germany through acne-riddled high school years and his adolescent discoveries of alcohol, women, and the Los Angeles Public Library's collection of D. H. Lawrence, "Ham on Rye" offers a crude, brutal, and savagely funny portrait of an outcast's coming-of-age during the desperate days of the Great Depression.	288	September 1982	Henry Chinaski, Henry Chinaski, Sr, Katherine Chinaski	United States of America, Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38501.Ham_on_Rye
