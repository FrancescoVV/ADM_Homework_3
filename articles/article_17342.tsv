Foster Fox (A 10,000 Lakes Tale)		William D. Writer	4.24	37	4	A raging flood develops in the North Woods leaving the south bank slightly underwater forcing most of its creatures to cross over the river to the North Bank or seek high ground. Newborn fox cub Foster Fox has been separated from his kin and is afraid of the rising waters. Sacrifices are made as Foster Fox escapes one danger on the South Bank of the North Woods, to a safe zone where his fate lies in the hands of frightened individuals from The Woodlands Council and the Bird and Bug Network who ultimately decide, because of the usurpation of the food chain, to thrust him off into the North Woods where carnivores like him dwell. Foster must grow up quickly as he is confronted by the ferocious predator, Lone Gray Wolf, who has chosen him for dinner, which unsettles the emotions of many animals causing the whole forest to react.	40	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14388481-foster-fox
