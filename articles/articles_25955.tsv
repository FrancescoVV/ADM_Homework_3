The Parent Agency	The Blockbuster Baddiel Box	David Baddiel	4.16	2149	166	A boy travels to an alternate world where kids get to choose their own parents in this zany, internationally bestselling adventure, which combines the be-careful-what-you-wish-for humor of The Chocolate Touch with the classic appeal of Roald Dahl. Barry Bennett is sick of his parents. They’re boring, they’re too strict, and it’s their fault his name is Barry . So he makes a wish for better ones—and is whisked away to the Parent Agency, where kids get to pick out their perfect parents. For Barry, this seems like a dream come true. But as he’s about to discover, choosing a new mom and dad isn’t as simple as it sounds… The Parent Agency is the first children’s book by British author and comedian David Baddiel, and it includes illustrations by Roald Dahl Funny Prize–winning artist Jim Field.	384	October 9th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26074192-the-parent-agency
