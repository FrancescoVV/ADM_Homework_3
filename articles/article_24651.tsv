Lights To My Siren	The Heroes of The Dixie Wardens MC #1	Lani Lynn Vale	4.20	6778	383	You’re The Lights... Sebastian had one rule. No women on the back of his bike. Period. The one time he broke that rule, he killed the woman that was carrying his child. Then comes Baylee Roberts. She makes Sebastian want to break every single rule he’d ever implemented. Hell, but she even makes him consider that dreaded H word. A helmet. To My... Baylee Roberts innocently walked into her bathroom never expecting that she’d find a man in there. It is her bathroom after all, and she lives alone. From the instant he placed his hat on her head to protect her from the sun, Baylee’s mind becomes filled with thoughts of a certain biker. She really shouldn't go there. There’s no telling what kind of dangerous things he does for The Dixie Wardens MC. Siren... Nothing is ever as easy as it should be. Their relationship’s one of them. Baylee’s brother is a cop. Baylee’s father is a cop. Which inevitably means that Baylee’s going to have certain hang-ups about being with a man like him. Sebastian has a lot on his plate with his busy job as a firefighter, a single father, and the vice president of The Dixie Wardens MC. Not enough, though, to keep him away from Baylee. When a series of arsons rattle their hometown and puts Sebastian’s life on the line, Baylee finally realizes the only fire Sebastian can’t put out is the one inside her heart.	312	September 29th 2014	Sebastian Mackenzie, Baylee Roberts	Kilgore, Texas (United States), Benton, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26144414-lights-to-my-siren
