Disgrace		J.M. Coetzee	3.84	87810	6254	Set in post-apartheid South Africa, J. M. Coetzeeâ€™s searing novel tells the story of David Lurie, a twice divorced, 52-year-old professor of communications and Romantic Poetry at Cape Technical University. Lurie believes he has created a comfortable, if somewhat passionless, life for himself. He lives within his financial and emotional means. Though his position at the university has been reduced, he teaches his classes dutifully; and while age has diminished his attractiveness, weekly visits to a prostitute satisfy his sexual needs. He considers himself happy. However, when Lurie seduces one of his students, he sets in motion a chain of events that will shatter his complacency and leave him utterly disgraced.	220	1999	David Lurie, Lucy Lurie, Petrus, Bev Shaw, Melanie Isaacs	South Africa, Cape Town (South Africa)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6192.Disgrace
