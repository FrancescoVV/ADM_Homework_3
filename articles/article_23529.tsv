Fright Night		John Skipp, Craig Spector	4.03	382	30	Based on the motion picture written by Tom Holland. Charley has seen the coffin and the bodies drained of blood. He knows he will be the vampire's next victim. But no one will believe him: not the police, not his girlfriend Amy, not even the school weirdo, Evil Ed. Charley's last chance is to enlist the help of Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer, star of a hundred horror movies and host of TV's Fright Night. Nobody thinks he's telling the truthâ€”until Evil Ed becomes a vampire and Amy is dragged into his next-door neighbour's evil, foul-smelling house of death!	171	1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3728095-fright-night
