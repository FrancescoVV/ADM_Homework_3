Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book		Dr. Seuss	4.17	10105	447	Catch a case of the yawns with Dr. Seuss in this classic rhyming picture book. Bedtime has never been more fun! A yawn is quite catching, you see. Like a cough. It just takes one yawn to start other yawns off. Dr. Seuss spins a sleep-tastic tale about a very small bug and a very big yawn that spreads and spreads. Meanwhile, the Audio-Telly-o-Tally-o Count adds up every sleeping creature from the country of Keck to the Castle of Krupp. First one, then seven, all the way to the billions and zillions, the Who's-Asleep-Count just keeps growing and growing! This book is a perfect bedtime story that will have the most reluctant readers laughing, and the most reluctant sleepers snoring! Ninety-nine zillion, nine trillion and two Creatures are sleeping! So...How about you? "Pretty much all the stuff you need to know is in Dr. Seuss." -President Barack Obama	58	August 1st 1962			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7772.Dr_Seuss_s_Sleep_Book
