Ethan Frome		Edith Wharton	3.41	109110	5433	The classic novel of despair, forbidden emotions, and sexual undercurrents set against the austere New England countryside Ethan Frome works his unproductive farm and struggles to maintain a bearable existence with his difficult, suspicious and hypochondriac wife, Zeena. But when Zeena's vivacious cousin enters their household as a hired girl, Ethan finds himself obsessed with her and with the possibilities for happiness she comes to represent. In one of American fiction's finest and most intense narratives, Edith Wharton moves this ill-starred trio toward their tragic destinies. Different in both tone and theme from Wharton's other works, Ethan Frome has become perhaps her most enduring and most widely read book.	99	1911	Ethan Frome, Mrs. Hale, Zeena Frome, Mattie Silver, Mrs. Ned Hale, Denis Eady, Jotham Powell, Harmon Gow, Michael Eady, Lawyer Varnum, Ned Hale, Orin Silver, Andrew Hale, Aunt Martha Pierce, Mrs. Frome, Mrs. Homan, Dr. Buck, Eliza Spears, Aunt Philura Maple, Daniel Byrne, Dr. Kidder, Mrs. Varnum	Starkfield, Massachusetts (United States), New England (United States), Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5246.Ethan_Frome
