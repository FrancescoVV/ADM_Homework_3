The Water Knife		Paolo Bacigalupi	3.84	21109	2973	In the American Southwest, Nevada, Arizona, and California skirmish for dwindling shares of the Colorado River. Into the fray steps Angel Velasquez, leg-breaker, assassin, and spy. A Las Vegas water knife, Angel "cuts" water for his boss, Catherine Case, ensuring that her luxurious developments can bloom in the desert, so the rich can stay wet while the poor get dust. When rumors of a game-changing water source surface in drought-ravaged Phoenix, it seems California is making a play to monopolize the life-giving flow of the river, and Angel is sent to investigate. There, he encounters Lucy Monroe, a drought-hardened journalist, and Maria Villarosa, a young refugee who survives by her wits in a city that despises everything she represents. For Angel, Lucy, and Maria, time is running out and their only hope for survival rests in each other’s hands. But when water is more valuable than gold, alliances shift like sand, and the only thing for certain is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.	371	May 26th 2015	Angel Velasquez, Maria Villarosa, Lucy Monroe, Julio, Toomie, James (Jamie) Sanderson, Anna (Paolo Bacigalupi), Sarah	Phoenix, Arizona (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23209924-the-water-knife
