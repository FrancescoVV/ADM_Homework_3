Not Fade Away		Jim Dodge	4.00	792	58	A road trip novel from the author of Fup that "reads like Kerouac's On the Road as it might have been written by Hunter S. Thompson" ( The Plain Dealer ). George Gastin is a Bay Area tow-truck operator who wrecks cars as part of an insurance scam. One of the cars he is hired to demolish is a snow-white Cadillac that was supposed to be a present for the Big Bopper, who died in the Iowa plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens. Gastin has a change of heart and takes off in the car, heading for Texas where the Bopper is buried. Armed with a thousand hits of Benzedrine and chased by adversaries real and imagined, Gastin navigates a road trip that covers many miles and states of mind. Traveling in time from the Beat era to the dawn of the sixties, from the coffeehouses of North Beach to the open plains of America, Gastin picks up some extraordinary hitchhikers: the self-proclaimed "world's greatest salesman," the Reverend Double-Gone Johnson, and a battered housewife with a box of old 45s. As the miles and sleepless hours roll by, Gastin's trip becomes a blur of fantasy and reality fueled by a soundtrack of classic rock 'n' roll. "His surreal voyage into the chaos of night carries him into the heart of America's darkest psychological landscapes. Not Fade Away shakes, rattles, and rolls." -- San Francisco Chronicle	304	1987			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/380810.Not_Fade_Away
