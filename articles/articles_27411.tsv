The Best Laid Plans		Terry Fallis	3.89	9562	1003	A burnt-out political aide quits just before an election — but is forced to run a hopeless campaign on the way out. He makes a deal with a crusty old Scot, Angus McLintock — an engineering professor who will do anything, anything, to avoid teaching English to engineers — to let his name stand in the election. No need to campaign, certain to lose - or is he?	314	August 22nd 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4441294-the-best-laid-plans
