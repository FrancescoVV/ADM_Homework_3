Daughter of the Forest	Sevenwaters #1	Juliet Marillier	4.24	56933	4215	Lovely Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. Bereft of a mother, she is comforted by her six brothers who love and protect her. Sorcha is the light in their lives: they are determined that she know only contentment. But Sorcha's joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can liftâ€”by staying silent. If she speaks before she completes the quest set to her by the Fair Folk and their queen, the Lady of the Forest, she will lose her brothers forever. When Sorcha is kidnapped by the enemies of Sevenwaters and taken to a foreign land, she is torn between the desire to save her beloved brothers, and a love that comes only once. Sorcha despairs at ever being able to complete her task, but the magic of the Fair Folk knows no boundaries, and love is the strongest magic of them all...	554	April 1st 1999	Simon Holt, Lord Colum, Hugh of Harrowfield, Liam the God, Lady Anne, Sorcha, Finbar, Diarmid, Padriac, Margery, Fat Janis, Cormack, Father Brian, Seamus Redbeard, Lady Oonagh, Eilis, Richard of Northwoods, Benedict of Greystones, John --		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13928.Daughter_of_the_Forest
