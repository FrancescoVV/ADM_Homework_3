Our Mutual Friend		Charles Dickens	4.08	26090	1477	A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap’s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights “Noddy” Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes “the Golden Dustman.” Charles Dickens’s last complete novel, Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens’s most complex—and satisfying—novels.	801	November 1865	Jenny Wren, Jesse Hexam, Lizzie Hexam, Charley Hexam, Roger Riderhood, Pleasant Riderhood, John Harmon, Bella Wilfer, Hamilton Veneering, Anastatia Veneering, Melvin Twemlow, Eugene Wrayburn, Mortimer Lightwood, Lady Tippins, John Podsnap, Mrs. Podsnap, Georgiana Podsnap, Nicodemus Boffin, Henrietta Boffin, Reginald Wilfer, Mrs. Wilfer, Lavinia Wilfer, Alfred Lammle, Sophronia Lammle, Abbey Potterson, Bob Gliddery, Silas Wegg, Mr. Venus, George Sampson, Bradley Headstone, Emma Peecher, Sloppy, Betty Higden, Mr. Fledgeby, Mr. Riah		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31244.Our_Mutual_Friend
