The Vampire Tapestry		Suzy McKee Charnas	3.57	2109	229	Edward Weyland is far from your average vampire: not only is he a respected anthropology professor but his condition is biological â€” rather than supernatural. He lives discrete lifetimes bounded by decades of hibernation and steals blood from labs rather than committing murder. Weyland is a monster who must form an uneasy empathy with his prey in order to survive, and The Vampire Tapestry is a story wholly unlike any you've heard before.	285	August 1980			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/975885.The_Vampire_Tapestry
