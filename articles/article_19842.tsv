Now she is old enough to marry, but when her childhood friend, Seylin, proposes, she doesn't take him seriously. Devastated, Seylin leaves the kingdom, intent on finding his own people: the elves. Too late, Emily realizes what Seylin means to her and sets out in search of him. But as Emily and Seylin come closer to their goals, they bring two worlds onto a collision course, awakening hatred and prejudices that have slumbered for years.	216	October 1st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/500657.Close_Kin
