She was independent, strong, and had managed on her own for a very long time. That was, until the dark, handsome Desmond LaGrange showed up at the bar where she worked. How could she know that this mysterious man would end up saving her from the evil that she didn't even know existed? And why was she so drawn to him? Why did he make her body heat with just a simple look? Desmond LaGrange was fighting a past he was trying hard to forget. But when he see's the beautiful Abby working behind the bar - something deep inside compels him to get closer. The only question is why? And when he saves her from danger - can he resist the strong pull between them to let her go when the time comes?
