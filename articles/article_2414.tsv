The Grim Grotto	A Series of Unfortunate Events #11	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	4.00	96737	2326	Dear Reader, Unless you are a slug, a sea anemone, or mildew, you probably prefer not to be damp. You might also prefer not to read this book, in which the Baudelaire siblings encounter an unpleasant amount of dampness as they descend into the depths of despair, underwater. In fact, the horrors they encounter are too numerous to list, and you wouldn't want me even to mention the worst of it, which includes mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing. As a dedicated author who has pledged to keep recording the depressing story of the Baudelaires, I must continue to delve deep into the cavernous depths of the orphans' lives. You, on the other hand, may delve into some happier book in order to keep your eyes and your spirits from being dampened. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket	323	September 21st 2004	Count Olaf, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Violet Baudelaire, Esm√© Squalor, Carmelita Spats, Kit Snicket, Captain Widdershins		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65111.The_Grim_Grotto
