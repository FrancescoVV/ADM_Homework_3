Rabbit, Run	Rabbit Angstrom #1	John Updike	3.58	54733	3295	Rabbit, Run is the book that established John Updike as one of the major American novelists of his—or any other—generation. Its hero is Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, a onetime high-school basketball star who on an impulse deserts his wife and son. He is twenty-six years old, a man-child caught in a struggle between instinct and thought, self and society, sexual gratification and family duty—even, in a sense, human hard-heartedness and divine Grace. Though his flight from home traces a zigzag of evasion, he holds to the faith that he is on the right path, an invisible line toward his own salvation as straight as a ruler’s edge.	337	1960	Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, Janice Angstrom, Nelson Angstrom, Ruth Leonard, Jack Eccles	Brewer, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40656712-rabbit-run
