Reaper's Property	Reapers MC #1	Joanna Wylde	4.10	53928	3804	Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother’s house one afternoon doesn’t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now. But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she’s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse—she doesn’t know his real name or where he lives, she’s ninety percent certain he’s a criminal and that the “business” he talks with her brother isn’t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he’d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms. Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she’s not interested in becoming “property of”. Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live. Maybe.	306	January 9th 2013	Marcus "Horse" McDonnell, Marie Jensen, Jesse "Ruger" Gray, Reese "Picnic" Hayes, Em Hayes, Levi “Painter” Brooks	Yakima Valley, Washington (United States), Coeur d'Alene, Idaho (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17375956-reaper-s-property
