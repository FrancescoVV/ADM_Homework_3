Sklepy cynamonowe / Sanatorium pod KlepsydrÄ…		Bruno Schulz	4.03	3463	223	The collected fiction of "one of the most original imaginations in modern Europe" (Cynthia Ozick) Bruno Schulz's untimely death at the hands of a Nazi stands as one of the great losses to modern literature. During his lifetime, his work found little critical regard, but word of his remarkable talents gradually won him an international readership. This volume brings together his complete fiction, including three short stories and his final surviving work, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass . Illustrated with Schulz's original drawings, this edition beautifully showcases the distinctive surrealist vision of one of the twentieth century's most gifted and influential writers.	260	1937			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2161325.Sklepy_cynamonowe_Sanatorium_pod_Klepsydr_
