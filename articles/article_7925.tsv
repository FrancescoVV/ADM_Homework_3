The List		Siobhan Vivian	3.43	24744	3240	An intense look at the rules of high school attraction - and the price that's paid for them. It happens every year. A list is posted, and one girl from each grade is chosen as the prettiest, and another is chosen as the ugliest. Nobody knows who makes the list. It almost doesn't matter. The damage is done the minute it goes up. This is the story of eight girls, freshman to senior, "pretty" and "ugly." And it's also the story of how we see ourselves, and how other people see us, and the tangled connection of the two.	336	April 1st 2012	Abby Warner, Danielle DeMarco, Candace Kincaid, Lauren Finn, Sarah Singer, Bridget Honeycutt, Jennifer Briggis, Margo Gable		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10866233-the-list
