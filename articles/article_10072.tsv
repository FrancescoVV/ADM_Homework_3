While I Live	The Ellie Chronicles #1	John Marsden	3.76	6633	226	Internationally bestselling author John Marsden takes us beyond The Tomorrow Series ... but the war isn't over. For Ellie Linton, being back on the farm with her parents is what makes the terrible things that happened during the war -- the things she, Homer, Lee, Fi, and the others had to do -- all worthwhile. It's where she belongs. But the war won't let her go. A devastating tragedy has shattered any hope she ever had to reclaim her life, or herself. It's a new kind of fight. And the enemy isn't always from the other side of the border. Another spectacular novel of war and its consequences by bestselling author John Marsden.	304	November 1st 2003	Ellie Linton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71866.While_I_Live
