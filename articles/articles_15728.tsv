Shadow Hills	Shadow Hills #1	Anastasia Hopcus	3.67	3651	458	After her sister Athena's tragic death, it's obvious that grief-stricken Persephone "Phe" Archer no longer belongs in Los Angeles. Hoping to make sense of her sister's sudden demise and the cryptic dreams following it, Phe abandons her bubbly LA life to attend an uptight East Coast preparatory school in Shadow Hills, MA -- a school which her sister mysteriously mentioned in her last diary entry before she died. Once there, Phe quickly realizes that something is deeply amiss in her new town. Not only does Shadow Hills' history boast an unexplained epidemic that decimated hundreds of its citizens in the 1700s, but its modern townies also seem eerily psychic, with the bizarre ability to bend metal. Even Zach -- the gorgeous stranger Phe meets and immediately begins to lust after -- seems as if he is hiding something serious. Phe is determined to get to the bottom of it. The longer she stays there, the more she suspects that her sister's untimely death and her own destiny are intricately linked to those who reside in Shadow Hills.	388	August 24th 2010	Persephone 'Phe' Archer, Zach Redford, Corinne Redford, Toy Donnelly, Adriana Dolski, Trent Redford IV, Tripp Redford, Grant Redford, Mr. Carr, Mrs. Carr, Brody Kincaid	Shadow Hills, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6920820-shadow-hills
