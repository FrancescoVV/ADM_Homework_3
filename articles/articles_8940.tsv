The White Lioness	Kurt Wallander #3	Henning Mankell, Laurie Thompson	3.86	18923	1104	The execution-style murder of a Swedish housewife looks like a simple case even though there is no obvious suspect. But then Wallander learns of a determined stalker, and soon enough, the cops catch up with him. But when his alibi turns out to be airtight, they realize that what seemed a simple crime of passion is actually far more complex—and dangerous. Combining compelling insights into the sinister side of modern life with a riveting tale of international intrigue, The White Lioness keeps you on the knife-edge of suspense.	576	1993	Kurt Wallander, Louise Åkerblom, Anatoli Konovalenko, Victor Mabasha, President de Klerk, Pastor Tureson, Robert Åkerblom, Linda Wallander, Vladimir Rykoff	Sweden, South Africa, Ystad, Skåne (Sweden)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39801.The_White_Lioness
