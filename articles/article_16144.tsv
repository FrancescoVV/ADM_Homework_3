A Little Bit of Everything For Dummies		John Wiley & Sons	3.30	3625	94	Twenty years ago the very first For Dummies book, DOS For Dummies , was published. From that first printing of that first book came a series unlike anything in the publishing world, one that is global in both geography - we have been published worldwide in some 30 languages - and in coverage. No single volume can hope to summarize what thousands of titles have meant to millions of readers over the years, and we don't claim to do that in this e-book. Rather, this e-book celebrates the breadth and depth of the For Dummies series, offering 20 chapters - in honor of our 20 years - from a list of books compiled by our global colleagues. We are confident the chapters we've included give you a representative glimpse at why - no matter what the topic - our products have meant so much to so many by Making Everything Easier. We've grouped our chapters into five main parts: Part I: Dummies Classics , offers four chapters from some of our best-loved books. There's a chapter from DOS For Dummies, the book that started it all, and chapters from two of our best-sellers: Windows 7 For Dummies and Sex For Dummies . And just for a bit of spice, we've included a chapter from French For Dummies. Part II: Daily Dose of Dummies , offers the kind of lifestyle, self-help, and business skills that our readers have come to treasure. There's one of our famous Part of Tens chapters from Cognititive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies and a chapter from Meditation For Dummies to help you get your center. Chapters from Leadership For Dummies and Marketing For Dummies help you develop new skills for the marketplace. Part III, Fun with Dummies , celebrates life and all it has to offer. We've got chapters here from The Royal Wedding For Dummies , Guitar For Dummies , Digital Photography SLR All-in-One For Dummies , Puppies for Dummies, Knitting For Dummies, and Wine For Dummies . Part IV, Get Social , highlights how we help you grow and develop new skills. Chapters here come from Facebook For Dummies, Social Media Marketing For Dummies , and Dating For Dummies . Part V, Going Global , shares the worldwide appeal of the For Dummies series. These chapters from British History For Dummies , Canadian History For Dummies , and Rugby Union For Dummies were created by our global colleagues and authors and show how the For Dummies approach applies not only to whatever the subject is at hand, but also wherever the discussion is taking place.
