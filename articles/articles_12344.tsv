Memoirs of a Midget		Walter de la Mare, Alison Lurie	3.69	207	36	Miss M., the narrator of these fictional memoirs, is a diminutive young woman (though just how diminutive, the author never says) with a “passion for shells, fossils, flints, butterflies, and stuffed animals.” Miss M. tells of her early life as a dreamy orphan and, in particular, of her tempestuous twentieth year—in which she falls in love with a beautiful and ambitious full-sized woman and is courted by a male dwarf. Concluding that she must choose either to simply tolerate her difference or grow callous to it, Miss M. resolves to become independent by offering herself up as a spectacle in a circus. [ Walter de la Mare (1873–1956) wrote numerous novels, short stories, essays, and poems. He was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Memoirs of a Midget .
