Deep and Dirty: A Novel		Douglas Dell	4.78	9	6	Robert Winchester abruptly parts life as an investigative journalist in New York City with no firm plans for the future. After inheriting his uncle’s home in the North Florida backwoods he uncovers the dirty secrets of a drug ring, three ritualistic murders and a sheriff’s department plagued by corruption and links to a powerful drug syndicate. Its far reaching tentacles suffocate a poor rural community that can ill-afford its presence. Winchester delves into the unfathomable depths of poverty, the cruelty of dependence and a vicious crime circle. The action is fast paced and shocking when the former city newshound comes head-to-head with the murderous and manipulative Captain Cocaine and his corrupt lieutenant.	280	April 3rd 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44200541-deep-and-dirty
