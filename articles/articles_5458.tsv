It Had to Be You	Chicago Stars #1	Susan Elizabeth Phillips	4.03	59167	2324	What if a woman who knows nothing about sports inherits a professional football team? The Windy City definitely isn't ready for Phoebe Somerville, the outrageous York knockout who’s taking over their home town team. And Phoebe is definitely not prepared for the Stars' head coach Dan Calebow, a sexist jock taskmaster with a one-track mind. This is the book that began it all. The Chicago Stars are about to take the field... and they’re not the only ones playing for keeps.	376	1994	Phoebe Somerville, Dan Calebow, Bobby Tom Denton, Molly Somerville	United States of America, Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73070.It_Had_to_Be_You
