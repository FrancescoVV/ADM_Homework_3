American Gods	American Gods #1	Neil Gaiman	4.11	762635	38672	Days before his release from prison, Shadow's wife, Laura, dies in a mysterious car crash. Numbly, he makes his way back home. On the plane, he encounters the enigmatic Mr Wednesday, who claims to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America. Together they embark on a profoundly strange journey across the heart of the USA, whilst all around them a storm of preternatural and epic proportions threatens to break. Scary, gripping and deeply unsettling, American Gods takes a long, hard look into the soul of America. You'll be surprised by what - and who - it finds there... This is the author's preferred text, never before published in the UK, and is about 12,000 words longer than the previous UK edition.	635	June 19th 2001	Shadow Moon, Mr. Wednesday, Spider, Laura Moon, Hinzelmann, Easter, Whiskey Jack, Loki, Odin, Mr. Ibis, Samantha Black Crow, Bilquis, Media, Mad Sweeney, Czernobog, Mr. Jacquel, Mr. Nancy, Chad Mulligan, Margaret Black Crow, Mr. Town, Mr. World, Technical Boy	United States of America, Chicago, Illinois (United States), Chattanooga, Tennessee (United States), Minnesota (United States) Wisconsin (United States) Illinois (United States), Minnesota (United States), Wisconsin (United States), Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30165203-american-gods
