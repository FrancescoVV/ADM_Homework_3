Push		Sapphire	3.84	47963	6120	Precious Jones, an illiterate sixteen-year-old, has up until now been invisible: invisible to the father who rapes her and the mother who batters her and to the authorities who dismiss her as just one more of Harlem's casualties. But when Precious, pregnant with a second child by her father, meets a determined and highly radical teacher, we follow her on a journey of education and enlightenment as Precious learns not only how to write about her life, but how to make it her own for the first time.	177	June 11th 1996	Claireece Precious Jones, Blue Rain	Harlem, New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71332.Push
