Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman		Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel, Jay Rubin	3.84	31110	2129	Collection of twenty-four stories that generously expresses Murakami’s mastery of the form. From the surreal to the mundane, these stories exhibit his ability to transform the full range of human experience in ways that are instructive, surprising, and relentlessly entertaining. Here are animated crows, a criminal monkey, and an iceman, as well as the dreams that shape us and the things we might wish for. Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami’s characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all.	333	July 2006		Japan, South Pole (Antarctica), Singapore, Hawaii (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9833.Blind_Willow_Sleeping_Woman
