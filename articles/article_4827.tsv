Beyond the Highland Mist	Highlander #1	Karen Marie Moning	3.97	65806	3084	He would sell his warrior soul to possess her... An alluring laird... He was known throughout the kingdom as Hawk, legendary predator of the battlefield and the boudoir. No woman could refuse his touch, but no woman ever stirred his heart—until a vengeful fairy tumbled Adrienne de Simone out of modern-day Seattle and into medieval Scotland. Captive in a century not her own, entirely too bold, too outspoken, she was an irresistible challenge to the sixteenth-century rogue. Coerced into a marriage with Hawk, Adrienne vowed to keep him at arm's length—but his sweet seduction played havoc with her resolve. A prisoner in time... She had a perfect "no" on her perfect lips for the notorious laird, but Hawk swore she would whisper his name with desire, begging for the passion he longed to ignite within her. Not even the barriers of time and space would keep him from winning her love. Despite her uncertainty about following the promptings of her own passionate heart, Adrienne's reservations were no match for Hawk's determination to keep her by his side...	375	March 9th 1999	Adrienne de Simone, Adam Black, Sidheach (Hawk) James Lyon Douglas	Scotland, Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/743599.Beyond_the_Highland_Mist
