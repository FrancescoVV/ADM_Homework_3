Scar		Ryan Frawley	3.36	28	9	Dermot Fallon has a disease. Currently hospitalized in Vancouver, he recreates with lunatic clarity the circumstances surrounding his recent trip to Ireland to bury his father, and his own schizophrenic breakdown. Pursued by the past - that of his family and a nation, as well as his own - he in turn pursues Fiona, his cousin's fiancee, even as reality fragments into nightmare in the tangled tripwires of his brain. Told from Dermot's own perspective with extensive notes by his psychiatrist, Scar is a powerful meditation on death, love, loss, identity, family and the terrifying ecstasy of madness.	302	October 6th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12967752-scar
