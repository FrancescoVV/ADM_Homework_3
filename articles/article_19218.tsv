One Little Lie		Holly Willow	4.00	1	1	All it took was one little white lie to send Millie's world spiraling out of control. Now she's entangled in a web of lies. It's really not a good time for her to fall in love. But when a tall, dark, and charming man comes into her life, she's in danger of doing just that anyway. If she's going to have a shot with the man of her dreams, she has to find a way out of the mess she's in first. But that's going to be easier said than done.	329	October 15th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43167391-one-little-lie
