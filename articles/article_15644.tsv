Athine Verses: The Blood Sisters	The Daughter of Ares Chronicles #3	Shannon McRoberts	4.33	9	6	Update: As of 2013 I took this book off publication. However, you can still get it in Verses of Athine! Why did I take it down? Made my life easier because I went in and edited all the novellas again! Plus in Verses they are laid out in the order you need to read them. Book 5 in the series is in progress. Ever wondered what happened to the dragons or where vampires came from? Follow Athine on her adventure as she uncovers these and other secrets of the immortal born.	108	July 7th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16124989-athine-verses
