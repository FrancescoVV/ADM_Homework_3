Beneath This Man	This Man #2	Jodi Ellen Malpas	4.28	84276	4107	Book #2 of the erotic This Man trilogy Jesse Ward drowned her with his intensity and blindsided her with his passion, but he kept her away from his dark secrets and broken soul. Leaving him was the only way Ava O'Shea could survive. She should have known that Jesse Ward is impossible to escape--and now he's back in her life, determined to remind her of the sensual pleasures they had shared. Ava is equally determined to get at the truth beneath this man's steely exterior. That means letting herself get close to the Lord of the Manor once more. And it's exactly where Jesse wants her--within touching distance...	452	January 15th 2013	Ava O'Shea, Jesse Ward		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18149927-beneath-this-man
