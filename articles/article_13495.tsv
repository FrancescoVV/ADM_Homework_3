Pink and Say		Patricia Polacco	4.48	11142	814	There are few picture books written about the Civil War, and none are as powerful as this one. This story, about how a young black soldier rescues a white soldier, opens young readers' eyes to the injustices of slavery and the senselessness of war. Highly charged emotionally, this masterful retelling of a true story is seen through the white soldier's eyes.	48	September 15th 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/532069.Pink_and_Say
