Hill Country Man		Loralee Lillibridge	4.50	16	10	Divorced after discovering her husband’s affairs had been going on for years, Maggie Oliver returns to Shade Tree, Texas, hoping the peaceful Hill Country ranch life will restore her self-esteem and help tame her rebellious fifteen-year-old daughter. When a fire destroys her home and ex-rodeo star Sam Banner, now a local police officer, races back into her life, she vows to steer clear of Sam’s brand of trouble. The seductive Texas charm of her ex’s best man has always been a threat to her heart . . . a heart that could be broken again by the secret he’s kept for years. How can Maggie trust herself to make the right choice this time? Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith and the love of a HILL COUNTRY MAN.
