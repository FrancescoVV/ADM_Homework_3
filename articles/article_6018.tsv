Something Like Fate		Susane Colasanti	3.70	19249	1350	Lani and Erin are bonded for life. One thing that connects them is their fascination of fate. Lani wonders how much of our lives has already been decided and how much we can actually influence. Since the Unknown can unexpectedly change our lives forever, how much can we really control? From the minute Lani meets Jason, she can't deny the intense connection they share. It feels like she's known him forever. She's not sure if he feels it, too. But it doesn't matter. Because Jason is Erin's boyfriend. Lani is determined to ignore her feelings for Jason, no matter how powerful they are, rather than risk hurting her best friend. How long can Lani keep running from the boy who might be her destiny?	268	May 4th 2010	Jason (Argonaut), Blake, Erin, Lani		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6621143-something-like-fate
