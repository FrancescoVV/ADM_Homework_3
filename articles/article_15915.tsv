One More Chance	Rosemary Beach #8	Abbi Glines	4.28	28733	2015	Grant Carter did everything in his power to convince Harlow Manning that he was a good guy. More than a smooth-talker and someone she could trust. He had to overcome his reputation as a playboy, and his history with Harlow's half-sister, Nan, a woman with a reputation of her own. Harlow had taken the chance, falling hard and fast for the guy who thrilled her with his all-consuming desire. After a lifetime of avoiding bad boys like Grant, she had opened herself to the possibilities of love... But a life-changing secret has torn them apart, and now Grant and Harlow must decide if they have enough fight to make it work - or if the pain of betrayal has permanently destroyed their future.	273	August 11th 2014	Harlow Manning, Grant Carter	Rosemary Beach, Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17835766-one-more-chance
