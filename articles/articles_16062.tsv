Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE, Vol. 04	Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE #4	CLAMP, William Flanagan	4.28	4244	62	A FAIRYTALE TURNED NIGHTMARE! Young Syaoran embarks on a worlds-spanning adventure to restore the memory of the most important person in his life, the princess Sakura– even though he knows that she’ll never remember her love for him. The trail leads to a small town reminiscent of Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century, a place where the ghostly image of a golden-haired woman comes in the night to steal the town’s children. Syaoran and his band of outrageous friends–affable Fai D. Flowright, loose cannon Kurogane, the odd creature Mokona, and Sakura herself–mount their horses and venture into forbidding, barren woods to solve a mystery, rescue the children, and retrieve one more piece of Sakura’s missing memories.	192	February 17th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13577.Tsubasa
