Shadow Dancing: My Journey as My Wife Came Out of the Closet		Gary  Cooper	4.50	6	2	Shadow Dancing is my story and the stories of other men whose wives came out of the closet as lesbians and left them for a woman. This began for me after my wife of 13 years started a relationship (without my knowledge) with a woman. I was totally blindsided. I realized men seldom talk about hurt and pain, and they definitely do not talk about their wives leaving them for a woman and how it impacts their lives. This is how it impacted me and these men.	96	November 28th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36794488-shadow-dancing
