The Story of the Lost Child	L'amica geniale #4	Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein	4.40	81730	6148	Here is the dazzling saga of two women, the brilliant, bookish Elena and the fiery, uncontainable Lila. Both are now adults; life’s great discoveries have been made, its vagaries and losses have been suffered. Through it all, the women’s friendship has remained the gravitational center of their lives. Both women once fought to escape the neighborhood in which they grew up—a prison of conformity, violence, and inviolable taboos. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received books. In this final book, she has returned to Naples. Lila, on the other hand, never succeeded in freeing herself from the city of her birth. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity with the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect her neighborhood. Proximity to the world she has always rejected only brings her role as its unacknowledged leader into relief. For Lila is unstoppable, unmanageable, unforgettable! Against the backdrop of a Naples that is as seductive as it is perilous and a world undergoing epochal change, the story of a lifelong friendship is told with unmatched honesty and brilliance. The four volumes in this series constitute a long remarkable story that readers will return to again and again, and every return will bring with it new revelations.	473	October 29th 2014	Raffaella Cerullo (Lila), Elena Greco (Lenuccia), Stefano Carracci, Pasquale Peluso, Carmela Peluso, Ada Cappuccio, Antonio Cappuccio, Nino Sarratore, Enzo Scanno, Marcello Solara, Michele Solara, Pietro Airota, Gigliola Spagnuolo, Alfonso Carracci, Pinuccia Carracci, Rino Cerullo, Elisa Greco	Naples (Italy), Campania (Italy), Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25242224-the-story-of-the-lost-child
