Skipping Christmas		John Grisham	3.50	57053	4710	Imagine a year without Christmas. No crowded shops, no corny office parties, no fruitcakes, no unwanted presents. That's just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they'll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on the street without a rooftop Frosty the snowman; they won't be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash; they aren't even going to have a tree. They won't need one, because come December 25 they're setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But, as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas brings enormous consequences - and isn't half as easy as they'd imagined. A classic tale for modern times, Skipping Christmas offers a hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that has become part of our holiday tradition.	198	November 6th 2001	Luther Krank, Nora Krank, Blair Krank, Vic Frohmeyer, Spike Frohmeyer, Ned & Jude Becker, Wes & Trish Trogdon, Walt & Bev Scheel	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5357.Skipping_Christmas
