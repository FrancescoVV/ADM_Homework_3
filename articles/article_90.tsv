The Golden Compass	His Dark Materials #1	Philip Pullman	3.99	1290163	22295	Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world. Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true a champion as Roger or Asriel could want--but what Lyra doesn't know is that to help one of them will be to betray the other.	399	July 9th 1995	Lyra Belacqua, Pantalaimon, Lord Asriel, Iorek Byrnison, Iofur Raknison, Marisa Coulter, Lee Scoresby, Roger Parslow, Serafina Pekkala, Hester, Farder Coram, John Faa, Billy Costa	Oxford, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass
