The Book with No Pictures		B.J. Novak	4.34	22487	3259	A book with no pictures? What could be fun about that? After all, if a book has no pictures, there's nothing to look at but the words on the page. Words that might make you say silly sounds... In ridiculous voices... Hey, what kind of book is this, anyway? At once disarmingly simple and ingeniously imaginative, The Book With No Pictures inspires laughter every time it is opened, creating a warm and joyous experience to share--and introducing young children to the powerful idea that the written word can be an unending source of mischief and delight.	48	September 30th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821299-the-book-with-no-pictures
