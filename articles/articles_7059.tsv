Hope Was Here		Joan Bauer	4.01	19429	1617	When Hope and her aunt move to small-town Wisconsin to take over the local diner, Hope's not sure what to expect. But what they find is that the owner, G.T., isn't quite ready to give up yet - in fact, he's decided to run for mayor against a corrupt candidate. And as Hope starts to make her place at the diner, she also finds herself caught up in G.T.'s campaign - particularly his visions for the future. After all, as G.T. points out, everyone can use a little hope to help get through the tough times... even Hope herself. Filled with heart, charm, and good old-fashioned fun, this is Joan Bauer at her best.	186	September 11th 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522471.Hope_Was_Here
