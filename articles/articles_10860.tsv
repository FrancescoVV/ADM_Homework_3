A bloodstone dagger to ward off evil… In a matter of weeks, Savannah Cross has ascended, overcome a prince of darkness, and lost one whom she loved. Her powers have become a liability in the wake of her shattered world. Her rapid descent into a delusional vortex has made her unable to tell fantasy from reality. She knows her visions cannot be real and yet are as unquestionable as the air she breathes. Her only solace is the demise of the evil that would have destroyed her loved ones, but can evil ever truly die? Willow watches as Savannah spirals into chaos, but is unable to help. She must answer Death’s ultimatum with one of her own. How will she leave behind everything to embrace a sisterhood of immortals, who do not accept her? Savannah must pull herself from the dark void that has invaded her soul, while Willow must learn to embrace the hell-hound within, because an evil has awakened to avenge hell’s lost prince. Will they be strong enough to face the wrath of hell? NOTE: If you want to help get Caged in Spirit released sooner, please donate to my editing fund.
