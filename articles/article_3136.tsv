Daughter of the Blood	The Black Jewels #1	Anne Bishop	4.05	37491	2190	The Dark Kingdom is preparing itself for the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy--the arrival of a new Queen, a Witch who will wield more power than even the High Lord of Hell himself. But this new ruler is young, and very susceptible to influence and corruption; whoever controls her controls the Darkness. And now, three sworn enemies begin a ruthless game of politics and intrigue, magic and betrayal, and the destiny of an entire world is at stake.	412	March 1st 1998	Jaenelle Angelline, Daemon Sadi SaDiablo, Saetan SaDiablo, Lucivar Yaslana, Surreal SaDiablo		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47956.Daughter_of_the_Blood
