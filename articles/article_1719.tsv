The Ghost Moth (The Red Grouse Tales)		Leslie   Garland	4.30	4504	10	The Ghost Moth; a tragic tale of the Spirit versus the Flesh. Is it possible that a five hundred year old story of a young monk and his lover could impact on a family in the present day? As Joe reads an old folk tale and is drawn into a world of religious fanatics, witches, angels and she-devils, this unlikely possibility gradually becomes increasingly probable. A story about the desires of the sexes and the doctrines of religion, with hints at the supernatural and beautiful and atmospheric imagery, this controversial, adult, speculative, spiritual and philosophical tale will intrigue, entertain and keep you guessing in equal measure up until the last page. (Warning to sensitive readers; the story is an adult one and so deals with adult themes. It contains what some might find to be controversial views on both religion and sex, as well as mild sex scenes.)	321	July 25th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54668652-the-ghost-moth
