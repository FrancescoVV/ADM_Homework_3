Roadwork		Richard Bachman, Stephen King	3.60	28073	1097	Barton Dawes’ unremarkable but comfortable existence suddenly takes a turn for the worst. Highway construction puts him out of work and simultaneously forces him out of his home. Dawes isn’t the sort of man who will take an insult of this magnitude lying down. His single-minded determination to fight the inevitable course of progress drives his wife and friends away while he tries to face down the uncaring bureaucracy that has destroyed his once comfortable life. --stephenking.com	320	March 1981			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10577.Roadwork
