Hollowland	The Hollows #1	Amanda Hocking	3.96	17882	1594	"This is the way the world ends - not with a bang or a whimper, but with zombies breaking down the back door." Nineteen-year-old Remy King is on a mission to get across the wasteland left of America, and nothing will stand in her way - not violent marauders, a spoiled rock star, or an army of flesh-eating zombies.	312	September 28th 2010	Remy King		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31351167-hollowland
