On Dublin Street	On Dublin Street #1	Samantha Young	4.21	169874	9201	Jocelyn Butler has been hiding from her past for years. But all her secrets are about to be laid bare ... Four years ago, Jocelyn left her tragic past behind in the States and started over in Scotland, burying her grief, ignoring her demons, and forging ahead without attachments. Her solitary life is working well - until she moves into a new apartment on Dublin Street, where she meets a man who shakes her carefully guarded world to its core. Braden Carmichael is used to getting what he wants, and he's determined to get Jocelyn into his bed. Knowing how skittish she is about entering a relationship, Braden proposes an arrangement that will satisfy their intense attraction without any strings attached. But after an intrigued Jocelyn accepts, she realizes that Braden won't be satisfied with just mind-blowing passion. The stubborn Scotsman is intent on truly knowing her . . . down to the very soul.	372	August 31st 2012	Jocelyn Butler, Braden Carmichael, Ellie Carmichael, Adam Sutherland	Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15760001-on-dublin-street
