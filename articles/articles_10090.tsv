Death in the Clouds	Hercule Poirot #12	Agatha Christie	3.83	33936	1731	A woman is killed by a poisoned dart in the enclosed confines of a commercial passenger plane… From seat No.9, Hercule Poirot was ideally placed to observe his fellow air passengers. Over to his right sat a pretty young woman, clearly infatuated with the man opposite; ahead, in seat No.13, sat a Countess with a poorly-concealed cocaine habit; across the gangway in seat No.8, a detective writer was being troubled by an aggressive wasp. What Poirot did not yet realize was that behind him, in seat No.2, sat the slumped, lifeless body of a woman.	336	March 10th 1935	Inspector Japp, Hercule Poirot, Jane Grey, Madame Angéligue Giselle, James Ryder, Monsieur Armand Dupont, Daniel Clancy, Doctor Bryant, Norman Gale, Countess of Horbury, Venetia Kerr, Jean Dupont	France, Croydon, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16326.Death_in_the_Clouds
