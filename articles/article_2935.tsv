The Charterhouse of Parma		Stendhal, Arthur Schurig, Richard Howard, Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, Robert Andrew Parker	3.82	14718	601	Richard Howard's exuberant and definitive rendition of Stendhal's stirring tale has brought about the rediscovery of this classic by modern readers. Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history. As Balzac wrote, "Never before have the hearts of princes, ministers, courtiers, and women been depicted like this...one sees perfection in every detail." With beautiful illustrations by Robert Andrew Parker.	532	March 1839	Fabrice del Dongo, Gina del Dongo, Clelia Conti, Count Mosca, Rassi, Fabio Conti, Ferrante Palla, Prince Ranuce-Erneste IV, Prince Ranuce-Erneste V	Parma (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14680.The_Charterhouse_of_Parma
