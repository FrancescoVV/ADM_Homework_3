Before Jamaica Lane	On Dublin Street #3	Samantha Young	4.33	37561	2810	Despite her outgoing demeanor, Olivia is painfully insecure around the opposite sex—usually, she can’t get up the nerve to approach guys she’s interested in. But moving to Edinburgh has given her a new start, and, after she develops a crush on a sexy postgrad, she decides it’s time to push past her fears and go after what she wants. Nate Sawyer is a gorgeous player who never commits, but to his close friends, he’s as loyal as they come. So when Olivia turns to him with her relationship woes, he offers to instruct her in the art of flirting and to help her become more sexually confident. The friendly education in seduction soon grows into an intense and hot romance. But then Nate’s past and commitment issues rear their ugly heads, and Olivia is left brokenhearted. When Nate realizes he’s made the biggest mistake of his life, he will have to work harder than he ever has before to entice his best friend into falling back in love with him—or he may lose her forever….	432	January 7th 2014	Jocelyn Butler, Johanna Walker, Cameron MacCabe, Braden Carmichael, Ellie Carmichael, Adam Sutherland, Nate Sawyer, Olivia Holloway, Cole Walker	Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18115061-before-jamaica-lane
