Hot Six	Stephanie Plum #6	Janet Evanovich	4.19	118121	2446	Low-rent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum reaches depths of personal experience that other women detectives never quite do. In Hot Six , for example, a sequence of new and hideous cars bite the dust; she finds herself lumbered with a policeman's multiply incontinent dog; and she has several bad skin days. All this when she is trying to prove her distinctly more competent colleague and occasional boyfriend Ranger innocent of a mob hit; avoid the heavies trailing her in the hope of finding him; and cope with a wife-abusing bail defaulter with nasty habits, such as setting Stephanie on fire.	336	July 14th 2000	Ranger (Rangeman CEO), Lula, Grandma Mazur, Walter "Moonman" Dunphy, Joe Morelli, Stephanie Plum	Trenton, New Jersey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6858.Hot_Six
