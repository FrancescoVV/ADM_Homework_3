Heart of a Dog		Mikhail Bulgakov, Mirra Ginsburg	4.10	41784	2013	Mikhail Bulgakov's absurdist parable of the Russian Revolution. A world-famous Moscow professor -- rich, successful, and violently envied by his neighbors -- befriends a stray dog and resolves to achieve a daring scientific first by transplanting into it the testicles and pituitary gland of a dead man. But the results are wholly unexpected: a distinctly and worryingly human animal is on the loose, and the professor's hitherto respectable life becomes a nightmare beyond endurance. As in The Master and Margarita , the masterpiece he completed shortly before his death, Mikhail Bulgakov's early novel, written in 1925, combines outrageously grotesque ideas with a narrative of deadpan naturalism. The Heart of a Dog can be read as an absurd and wonderfully comic story; it can also be seen as a fierce parable of the Russian Revolution.	123	1925	Dr. Philip Philipovich Preobrazhensky, Poligraph Poligraphovich Sharikov, Dr. Ivan Arnoldovich Bormenthal, Schwonder, Zinaida Prokofievna Bunina, Darya Petrovna Ivanova	Moscow (Russian Federation), Russia, Soviet Union	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113205.Heart_of_a_Dog
