House of Stairs		William Sleator	3.85	4214	588	One by one, five sixteen-year-old orphans are brought to a strange building. It is not a prison, not a hospital; it has no walls, no ceiling, no floor. Nothing but endless flights of stairs leading nowhere, except back to a strange red machine. The five must learn to love the machine and let it rule their lives. But will they let it kill their souls?	176	1974			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24875.House_of_Stairs
