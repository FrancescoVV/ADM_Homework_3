Waistcoats & Weaponry	Finishing School #3	Gail Carriger	4.15	17908	1861	Sophronia continues her second year at finishing school in style—with a steel-bladed fan secreted in the folds of her ball gown, of course. Such a fashionable choice of weapon comes in handy when Sophronia, her best friend Dimity, sweet sootie Soap, and the charming Lord Felix Mersey stowaway on a train to return their classmate Sidheag to her werewolf pack in Scotland. No one suspected what—or who—they would find aboard that suspiciously empty train. Sophronia uncovers a plot that threatens to throw all of London into chaos and she must decide where her loyalties lie, once and for all.	298	November 4th 2014	Sophronia Temminnick, Dimity Plumleigh-Teignmott, Pillover Plumleigh-Teignmott, Lady Linette de Limmone, Aloysius Braithwope, Sidheag Maccon, Beatrice Lefoux		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20980648-waistcoats-weaponry
