Archangel's Kiss	Guild Hunter #2	Nalini Singh	4.22	50467	2246	New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh returns to her world of angelic rulers, vampiric servants, and the woman thrust into their darkly seductive world… Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux wakes from a year-long coma to find herself changed—an angel with wings the colors of midnight and dawn—but her fragile body needs time to heal before she can take flight. Her lover, the stunningly dangerous archangel Raphael, is used to being in control—even when it comes to the woman he considers his own. But Elena has never done well with authority… They’ve barely begun to understand each other when Raphael receives an invitation to a ball from the archangel Lijuan. To refuse would be a sign of fatal weakness, so Raphael must ready Elena for the flight to Beijing—and to the nightmare that awaits them there. Ancient and without conscience, Lijuan holds a power that lies with the dead. And she has organized the most perfect and most vicious of welcomes for Elena…	323	February 1st 2010	Elena Deveraux, Raphael (Archangel), Illium (Angel), Sara Haziz, Dmitri (Vampire), Jason (Angel), Venom (Vampire), Michaela (Archangel), Aodhan (Angel), Galen (Angel), Naasir (Vampire), Neha (Archangel), Keir (Angel)	The Refuge	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6582637-archangel-s-kiss
