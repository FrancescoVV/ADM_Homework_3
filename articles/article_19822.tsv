Night Rain	Mike Connolly Mystery #4	Joe Hilley	3.39	28	7	Dibber Landry lives in his uncle's house on Dauphin Island, a barrier island near the mouth of Mobile Bay. As a hurricane approaches, most of the island's permanent residents evacuate, but not Dibber, who has plundering on his mind. While rummaging through Inez Marchand's house, Dibber finds more than he expected-a dead body. Charged with murder, he turns to Mike Connolly for help. It's up to Mike to untangle a web of secrets no one else will touch.	320	March 20th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2375782.Night_Rain
