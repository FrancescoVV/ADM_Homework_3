The Calling	Darkness Rising #2	Kelley Armstrong	4.09	32206	1883	Maya Delaney's paw-print birthmark is the mark of what she truly is - a skin-walker. She can run faster, climb higher, and see better than nearly everyone else. Experiencing intense connections with the animals that roam the woods outside her home, Maya knows it's only a matter of time before she's able to Shift and become one of them. And she believes there may be others in her small town with surprising talents. Now Maya and her friends have been forced to flee from their homes during a forest fire they suspect was deliberately set. Then they're kidnapped, and after a chilling helicopter crash, they find themselves in the Vancouver Island wilderness with nothing but their extraordinary abilities to help them get back home. In THE CALLING, the sizzling second book in the Darkness Rising trilogy, New York Times bestselling author Kelley Armstrong pumps up the romance, danger, and suspense that left readers of THE GATHERING clamoring for more.	326	January 1st 2012	Maya Delaney, Daniel Bianchi, Rafael "Rafe" Martinez, Nicole Tillson, Sam Russo, Corey Carling, Hayley Morris, Calvin Antone	Canada	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11765920-the-calling
