Layman's Handbook, A journey to SELF		Aidan  McNally	4.37	543	7	A journey to SELF. Layman's Handbook to life as I see it of course. Self-help being primarily how to help one's self. Life can be strange and unusual for all of us. Is there something unique about any of us that can bring us to a place where no one else can understand? Is this just a feeling? Through some of my deepest and darkest moments in life I have been placed in situations where I felt there was no way out. Digging deeper inside of myself I found some simple techniques to clear my mind and allow an emotional freedom take precedent over my life. Layman's Handbook, shares with you some scenarios and techniques for a simpler life, a life that requires you to become content and dare I say it even Happy. I hope one day we can chat and discuss how our lives can become better using a few simple steps.	350	October 10th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50836219-layman-s-handbook-a-journey-to-self
