A Ring of Endless Light	Austin Family Chronicles #4	Madeleine L'Engle	4.16	18359	779	After a tumultuous year in New York City, the Austins are spending the summer on the small island where their grandfather lives. He’s very sick, and watching his condition deteriorate as the summer passes is almost more than Vicky can bear. To complicate matters, she finds herself as the center of attention for three very different boys. Zachary Grey, the troubled and reckless boy Vicky met last summer, wants her all to himself as he grieves the loss of his mother. Leo Rodney has been just a friend for years, but the tragic loss of his father causes him to turn to Vicky for comfort—and romance. And then there’s Adam Eddington. Adam is only asking Vicky to help with his research on dolphins. But Adam—and the dolphins—may just be what Vicky needs to get through this heartbreaking summer.	332	May 1st 1980	Katherine Forrester Vigneras, Vicky Austin, Rob Austin, Suzy Austin, Adam Eddington, Zachary Grey, Victoria Austin, Dr. Wallace Austin, John Austin, Reverend Eaton, Leo Rodney, Commander Jack Rodney, Justin Michel Vigneras	Thornhill, Connecticut (United States), Seven Bay Island (United States), Boston, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14358.A_Ring_of_Endless_Light
