Heaven, Texas	Chicago Stars #2	Susan Elizabeth Phillips	4.07	30470	1315	Come heck or high water, Gracie Snow is determined to drag the legendary ex-jock Bobby Tom Denton back home to Heaven, Texas, to begin shooting his first motion picture. Despite his dazzling good looks and killer charm, Bobby Tom has reservations about being a movie star — and no plans to cooperate with a prim and bossy Ohio wallflower whom he can’t get off his mind or out of his life. Instead, the hell-raising playboy decides to make her over from plain Jane to Texas wildcat. But nothing’s more dangerous than a wildcat with an angel’s heart in a town too small for a bad boy to hide. And all hell breaks loose when two unforgettable people discover love, laughter, passion — and a match that can only be made in Heaven.	384	April 1st 1995	Gracie Snow, Bobby Tom Denton	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Dallas, Texas (United States), Southern Region (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73084.Heaven_Texas
