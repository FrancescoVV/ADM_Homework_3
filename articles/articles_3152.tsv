Also included are concise introductions by Cooper and Hutchinson to each translation, meticulous annotation designed to serve both scholar and general reader, and a comprehensive index. This handsome volume offers fine paper and a high-quality Smyth-sewn cloth binding in a sturdy, elegant edition.	1848	-347	Socrates (philosopher)	Greece	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9462.Plato
