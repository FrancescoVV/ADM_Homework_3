The Tempering Blaze	Freedoms Holy Light #3	Sally Laity, Dianna Crawford	4.06	67	5	With the Boston Tea Party in December of 1773, the match was struck, kindling the flames of the American Revolution. This is the stirring conclusion to a gripping saga of love and war, betrayal and forgiveness. And here are the people who struggle with unexpected love and God's call in their lives. SUSANNAH HAYNES is held captive in Boston by the arrogant British Lieutenant Alex Fontaine, while her husband Dan runs for his life. TED HARRINGTON, Susannah's brother, who risked all to throw in his lost with the Colonies, tries (with his wife Jane) to escape the sentence of traitor to the Crown. YANCY CURTIS, who barely escaped with his life on the night of the Boston Tea Party, finds himself exiled in the mountains of Virginia. Young postrider BEN HAYNES, caught up in the fervor of patriotism, nearly misses God's will for his life, because of his obsession with the righteous cause of freedom.	393	February 14th 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2243610.The_Tempering_Blaze
