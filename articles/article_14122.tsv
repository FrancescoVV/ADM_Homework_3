Raised in the Redfern family, the girl with fiery hair and silvery-blue eyes was the undisputed leader of a gang of vampire raiders. Then came the discovery that shattered her life-- her mother was a human. Now, Jez hunts her former friends, protecting humans from the Night World. But when Circle Daybreak sends her on a search for one of the legendary Wild Powers, Jez has to rejoin her old gang. They want her back-- especially Morgead, the gorgeous green-eyed vampire who used to be her second-in-command. Jez wants to stay faithful to Hugh Davis, the human she loves. But Morgead swears he's her soulmate and he'll do anything to lure her back to the old ways. With danger and temptation around, Jez finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. And she's afraid that if she tastes blood again, she'll become the evil huntress she once was...	226	September 1st 1997	Jezebel Redfern, Morgead Blackthorn, Hugh Davis, Lily Redfern, Raven Mandril, Thisle Galena, Pierce Holt, Valerian Stillman, Iona Skelton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293972.Huntress
