Dead Girls, Dead Boys, Dead Things	Dead Girls, Dead Boys, Dead Things #1-3	Richard Calder	3.65	161	20	This extraordinary trilogy depicts a future gender war that crosses the boundaries of software, wetware, time, and reality itself in its imaginative leaps and bounds. Only love holds the future together in this tale of star-crossed teens whose transformations defy description or imagination. To read this trilogy is to behold a strange new world, one unlike any other.	400	February 15th 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1284103.Dead_Girls_Dead_Boys_Dead_Things
