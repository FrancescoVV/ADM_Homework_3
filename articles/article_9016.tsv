But there s nothing more stressful than practicing for her auditions, not knowing where her grandfather is, and being forced to lie about his whereabouts when her insistent great-uncle demands an audience with him. Then Gwen meets Robert, also in town for music auditions, and the two pair up to brave the city without supervision. As auditions approach and her great-uncle becomes more aggressive, Gwen and Robert make a startling discovery. Suddenly Gwen s hopes are turned upside down, and she and Robert are united in ways neither of them could have foretold. . . ."	167	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235125.Things_Hoped_For
