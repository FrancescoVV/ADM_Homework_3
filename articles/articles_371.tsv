As I Lay Dying		William Faulkner	3.72	137266	7511	As I Lay Dying is Faulkner’s harrowing account of the Bundren family’s odyssey across the Mississippi countryside to bury Addie, their wife and mother. Narrated in turn by each of the family members -- including Addie herself -- as well as others; the novel ranges in mood, from dark comedy to the deepest pathos. Considered one of the most influential novels in American fiction in structure, style, and drama, As I Lay Dying is a true 20th-century classic. This edition reproduces the corrected text of As I Lay Dying as established in 1985 by Noel Polk.	288	1930	Cash Bundren, Anse Bundren, Addie Bundren, Darl Bundren, Jewel Bundren, Dewey Dell, Vardaman Bundren, Vernon Tull, Cora Tull, Peabody	Mississippi (United States), United States of America, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77013.As_I_Lay_Dying
