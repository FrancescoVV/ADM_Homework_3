Turning Hearts		Deanne Blackhurst	3.47	135	40	Amanda knows there's a family out there that needs the gospel - and she also knows she's the one who's supposed to bring it to them. Her recurring dream makes it seem urgent - the dream with the shiny gold frame and the vaguely familiar faces smiling down at her. The dream in which her grandmother says, "You must find them. You're the only one who can." When Amanda gets to California and starts teaching, she wonders which family she was sent there to find. What happens next is something she never would have expected.	179	March 28th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6203395-turning-hearts
