The Season of Passage		Christopher Pike	4.16	3102	240	Dr. Lauren Wagner was a celebrity. She was involved with the most exciting adventure mankind had ever undertaken. The whole world admired and respected her. But Lauren knew fear. Inside--voices entreating her to love them. Outside--the mystery of the missing group that had gone before her. The dead group. But were they simply dead? Or something else? A terrifying novel of horror--and, surprisingly, of salvation--from one of America's bestselling writers. A novel you won't forget.	448	1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137975.The_Season_of_Passage
