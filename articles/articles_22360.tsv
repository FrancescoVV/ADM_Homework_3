The Meghadūta of Kālidāsa		Kālidāsa, M.R. Kale	4.19	318	25	A poem of 111 stanzas, it is one of Kālidāsa's most famous works. The work is divided into two parts, Purva-megha and Uttara-megha. It recounts how a yakṣa, a subject of King Kubera (the god of wealth), after being exiled for a year to Central India for neglecting his duties, convinces a passing cloud to take a message to his wife at Alaka on Mount Kailāsa in the Himālaya mountains. The yakṣa accomplishes this by describing the many beautiful sights the cloud will see on its northward course to the city of Alakā, where his wife awaits his return.	208	400			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/896422.The_Meghad_ta_of_K_lid_sa
