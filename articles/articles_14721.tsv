Undead and Uneasy	Undead #6	MaryJanice Davidson	3.89	16571	531	Weddings are never easy. But when you're Vampire Queen Betsy Taylor, they can become downright deadly... In the days leading up to The Big Day, Vampire Queen Betsy Taylor seems to have a full house - and the wedding guests have yet to arrive. Along with her human buddies, there's a ghost, a werewolf, and a Fiend crashing at her place. And though her fianc√©, Vampire King Eric Sinclair, conveniently disappears when the conversation turns to seating charts and flower arrangements, he does manage to make his oh-so-sexy presence known at other moments. Betsy knows the next few weeks won't be smooth sailing - but she never expects just what's in store for her. Cold feet are no surprise, especially with an undead groom. But when Sinclair truly goes missing - and not just to avoid wedding preparations - along with most of her friends and loved ones, Betsy is frantic. Alone and afraid for the fate of everyone she loves, Betsy can't trust anyone as she tries to find them and whoever is behind all the disappearances. And what happens next will shake the foundation of the vampire world forever.	272	June 5th 2007	Tina, Elizabeth "Betsy" Taylor, Eric Sinclair, Nick Berry, Garret Shea aka George, Antonia Wolfton, Michael Wyndham, Jeannie Wyndham, Derik Wyndham, Dr. Marc Spangler, Jessica Watson, Laura Goodman (Undead)	St. Paul, Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/478658.Undead_and_Uneasy
