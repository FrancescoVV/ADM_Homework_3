Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool		Emily Oster	4.12	8760	867	From the author of EXPECTING BETTER, an economist's guide to the early years of parenting With EXPECTING BETTER, award-winning economist Emily Oster spotted a need in the pregnancy market for advice that gave women the information they needed to make the best decision for their own pregnancies. By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In CRIBSHEET, she now tackles an even great challenge: decision making in the early years of parenting. As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There's a rule--or three--for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the tradeoffs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision?	352	April 9th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121328-cribsheet
