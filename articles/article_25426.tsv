White Horse	White Horse #1	Alex Adams	3.48	3163	710	When I wake the world is gone. Only fragments remain. And then I remember ...Before: Her life may have taken a couple of wrong turns but Zoe is trying to make the best of what she has. A part-time cleaning job to pay for college, a weekly appointment with her therapist to straighten out the problems in her life. The same problems that any thirty-year-old would have. Nothing major. Nothing life-threatening. A few bad dream, that's all. After: The only thought that remains is survival. Survival in a desolate, post-apocalyptic world. For herself. For her unborn baby. But help is scarce in a world where untold horrors exist around every corner, where food and water are in desperately short supply, and the only chance of happiness is half a world away.	400	April 17th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12173462-white-horse
