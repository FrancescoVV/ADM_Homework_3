Rebecca's Destiny (Redemption #2)		Gary  Green	4.27	111	6	Do you like fast paced fantasy adventure with a likeable heroine, elves, gnomes, fairies and a dragon? Then you’ll love Rebecca’s Destiny, the second book in the Redemption series. In Rebecca’s Destiny, Rebecca continues to fight for her life as Pan continues to plot her demise. Some of her human friends get involved as she continues to learn self-defense from Lancelot (yes, that Lancelot). She decides to visit the Oracle to ask about her destiny in hopes of finding a way to pacify Pan. Upon her return, she finds that Pip has brought more people into her secret, recruiting all her neighbors to help defend against the army of trolls gathering in the swamp beyond the woods. Rebecca’s Destiny keeps you guessing from beginning to end.	122	November 30th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27998615-rebecca-s-destiny
