Lassie Come-Home		Eric Knight, Marguerite Kirmse	4.18	21745	295	A beloved classic gets a beautiful new look. Lassie is Joe's prize collie and constant companion. But when Joe's father loses his job, Lassie must be sold. Three times she escapes from her new owner, and three times she returns home to Joe, until finally she is taken to the remotest part of Scotlandâ€”too far a journey for any dog to make alone. But Lassie is not just any dog. First published in 1940, Lassie Come-Home has become one of the best-loved dog stories in the world. This beautiful edition showcases the original text and illustrations within a striking new jacket.	256	1940	Lassie, Priscilla, Sam Carraclough, Joe Carraclough, Hynes	Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/895886.Lassie_Come_Home
