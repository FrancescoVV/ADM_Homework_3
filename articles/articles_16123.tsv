The Age of Revolution	A History of the English-Speaking Peoples #3	Winston S. Churchill	4.24	877	61	The third volume of Sir Winston Churchill's classic history. During the long period of 1688 to 1815, three revolutions took place and all led to war between the British and the French. The English Revolution of 1688 made a new enemy of an old foe; the American Revolution of 1775 saw the United States finally declare independence; and the French Revolution of 1789 reverberated across Europe for years to come. Who better to capture the character and vigour of Wellington, Walpole, Nelson and Pitt than the Prime Minister who led Britain to victory in Europe in 1945?	322	1957			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/945833.The_Age_of_Revolution
