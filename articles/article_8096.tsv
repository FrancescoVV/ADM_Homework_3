Reasons to Kill God		I.V. Olokita	3.96	114	39	“If you are able to write 180 pages of your memoir without putting the pen down, I might let you live…” Klaus Holland loves no one other than himself. He victimizes people for being Jews or for just being alive. He is an old Nazi criminal who escaped to Brazil and was caught and prosecuted. He is now forced to write his memoirs as part of his punishment – the same punishment he used to give Jews at the concentration camp. This punishment makes him remember and re-live his cruelty as the concentration camp commander and as a man. Deus Esperanca learns from his mother that what he believed to be his family’s history, was just a bunch of lies. He discovers that his real father is Klaus Holland – the sadistic Nazi fugitive. Having this information and his father being aware of what he knows, their lives intertwine and create chaos.	140	December 24th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45865582-the-executioner-from-the-silent-valley
