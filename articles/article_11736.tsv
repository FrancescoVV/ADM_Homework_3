Peyton Place	Peyton Place #1	Grace Metalious, Ardis Cameron	3.77	10109	943	First published in 1956, Peyton Place uncovers the passions, lies and cruelties that simmer beneath the surface of a postcard-perfect town. At the centre of the novel are three women, each with a secret to hide: Constance MacKenzie, the original desperate housewife; her daughter Allison, whose dreams are stifled by small-town small-mindedness; and Selena Cross, her gypsy-eyed friend from the wrong side of the tracks.	384	1956	Constance MacKenzie, Allison MacKenzie, Selena Cross	Peyton Place, New Hampshire (United States), New Hampshire (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/526869.Peyton_Place
