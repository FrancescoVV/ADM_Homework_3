Pilgrim's Rest	Miss Silver #10	Patricia Wentworth	3.92	940	76	The two Miss Pilgrims, Columba and Janette, think its unwise to leave their fine ancestral home, Pilgrim's Rest. When their brother suffers a fatal fall only days after talking about selling it, and his son, barely escapes two near-fatal accidents, they suspect it deadly to leave. Surely, Miss Silver can determine why the house hates to be empty.	279	1946			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1003604.Pilgrim_s_Rest
