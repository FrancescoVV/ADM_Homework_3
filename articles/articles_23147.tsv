For Fucks Sake		Robert Lasner	3.13	169	13	Already an underground cult classic, For Fucks Sake is a blisteringly honest and darkly comic portrayal of one man’s search for true love. Lasner takes us on an unforgettable ride from the Mardi Gras mayhem of New Orleans to the madness of early 1990s New York, hooking up along the way with, among others, a lesbian bartender and the wife of his best friend! "If all writers were like Robert Lasner, it would mean The End of American Literature. Since I support The End of American Literature, Iurge you to buy this book and give it to a teenager. Tell him that it’s the future of writing. In twenty years, a generation of Lasner clones will bloom and American Literature will end."—Neal Pollack, Author, Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature	316	March 19th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103979.For_Fucks_Sake
