Société		Alexander Helas	4.28	433	9	What happens when a man does the unthinkable? In this modern and magically profound debut novel, Alexander Helas delivers a masterful, thought-provoking vision on the struggle of free will at the hands of society's quest for progress. Christian Matters is a neurotic architect living in Chicago, but thrown off his routine by a bizarre episode he blames the whiskey on, he abandons his promising career, girlfriend, and home for a life-changing journey to California, where he meets a cavalier aristocrat named Lester Rothschild and the extravagant musician Ella Athens. Mysterious and insane, Lester takes Christian on his adventure to open Société, the most luxurious entertainment complex at the heart of the world's richest city. But, with the chance meeting of an unlikely visitor and the sudden death of a lover, colliding events lead him to unravel the true ambitions behind the greatly anticipated opening of Société, where he discovers the fate of something much greater is at stake. @AlexanderHelas Foreword INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards Finalist, 2015 USA Best Book Awards Finalist Visionary Fiction USA Best Book Awards Finalist New Age Fiction Southern California Book Festival Honorable Mention, LA Midwest Book Awards Honorable Mention, Chicago	290	June 2nd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25516432-soci-t
