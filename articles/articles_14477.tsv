The Top 500 Poems		William Harmon, William Shakespeare, Robert Frost, William Blake, Thomas Hardy, Chidiock Tichborne, John Keats, Walt Whitman, Alexander Pope, John Donne	4.16	470	56	The Top 500 Poems offers a vivid portrait of poetry in English, assembling a host of popular and enduring poems as chosen by critics, editors, poets, and general readers. These works speak across centuries, beginning with Chaucer's resourceful inventions and moving through Shakespeare's masterpieces, John Donne's complex originality, and Alexander Pope's mordant satires. The anthology also features perennial favorites such as William Blake, William Wordsworth, and John Keats; Emily Dickinson's prisms of profundity; the ironies of Wallace Stevens and T.S. Eliot; and the passion of Sylvia Plath and Allen Ginsberg. These 500 poems are verses that readers either know already or will want to know, encapsulating the visceral power of truly great literature. William Harmon provides illuminating commentary to each work and a rich introduction that ties the entire collection together.	1132	1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141453.The_Top_500_Poems
