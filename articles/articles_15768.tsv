Prisoners in the Palace		Michaela MacColl	3.78	3170	439	London, 1838. Sixteen-year-old Liza's dreams of her society debut are dashed when her parents are killed in an accident. Penniless, she accepts the position of lady's maid to young Princess Victoria and steps unwittingly into the gossipy intrigue of the servant's world below-stairs as well as the trickery above. Is it possible that her changing circumstances may offer Liza the chance to determine her own fate, find true love, and secure the throne for her future queen? Meticulously based on newly discovered information, this riveting novel is as rich in historical detail as Catherine, Called Birdy , and as sizzling with intrigue as The Luxe .	368	September 1st 2010	Elizabeth Hastings, Queen Victoria	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7926790-prisoners-in-the-palace
