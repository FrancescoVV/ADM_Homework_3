The Infinite Day	The Lamb Among the Stars #4	Chris Walley	4.41	320	24	“Vero, you remember you once said there were people who would follow me to the gates of hell?” “A figure of speech.” “We’d better find them. That’s where we’re going.”After the defeat of the evil Dominion forces at Farholme, Commander Merral D’Avanos prepares a task force to rescue thirty hostages captured by the fleeing Margrave Lezaroth. Merral’s only hope is that he can get to the hostages before they’re taken to Lord-Emperor Nezhuala at the Blade of Night—the nexus of the Dominion’s power. But in order to get there, Merral and his crew will have to survive a perilous trip through Below Space. Meanwhile, news of the Dominion’s defeat at Farholme reaches Ancient Earth but is tempered by the sobering truth of the enemy’s growth and strength. It is now clear that an attack on the Assembly is imminent, but how far should the Assembly go to stop it? And does the real danger lie in the Dominion or in the subtle evil that has arrived at the heart of the Assembly itself? "The Infinite Day" is the thrilling conclusion to the epic Lamb among the Stars series that has readers and critics raving.	576	May 14th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2436364.The_Infinite_Day
