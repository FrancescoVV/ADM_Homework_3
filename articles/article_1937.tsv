The Summer Garden	The Bronze Horseman #3	Paullina Simons	4.11	25106	2148	The Magnificent Conclusion to the Timeless Epic Saga Through years of war and devastation, Tatiana and Alexander suffered the worst the twentieth century had to offer. Miraculously reunited in America, they now have a beautiful son, Anthony, the gift of a love strong enough to survive the most terrible upheavals. Though they are still young, the ordeals they endured have changed them--and after living apart in a world laid waste, they must now find a way to live together in postwar America. With the Cold War rising, dark forces at work in their adopted country threaten their lives, their family, and their hard-won peace. To regain the happiness they once knew, to wash away the lingering pain of the past, two lovers grown distant must somehow forge a new life . . .or watch the ghosts of their yesterdays destroy their firstborn son. The Summer Garden . . . their odyssey is just beginning.	742	November 1st 2005	Tatiana Metanova, Alexander Barrington, Sam Gulotta, Anthony Barrington		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/608216.The_Summer_Garden
