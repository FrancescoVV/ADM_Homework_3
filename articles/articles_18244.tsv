Against the Wall	Firsts and Forever #7	Alexa Land	4.36	1301	136	Don’t start something you can’t finish. It’s a cliché, but 22-year-old graffiti artist Christian lives by those words. He’s going away when he graduates from art school in just six short months. With so little time left, getting involved with gorgeous Shea Nolan has to be a mistake. If only he could make himself stay away from the sweet, sexy police officer. Christian has a decision to make. Are a few months of happiness worth the inevitable heartbreak when it’s time to walk away? Against the Wall is the seventh book in Alexa Land’s best-selling Firsts and Forever series, but each book can stand alone, so jump in anywhere. PLEASE NOTE: For ADULT READERS ONLY. Includes explicit language and graphic sex.	448	January 11th 2015		California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24475309-against-the-wall
