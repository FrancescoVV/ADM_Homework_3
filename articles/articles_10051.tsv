Dragonflight / Dragonquest	Pern (Chronological Order)	Anne McCaffrey, Adrienne Barbeau, Michael Whelan	4.47	10915	65	Dragonflight and Dragonquest are the first two installments of McCaffrey's most popular series about the Dragonriders of Pern. In these epic fantasies, Lessa emerges from hiding after ten long Turns, ready to reclaim her brithright, impress the Dragon Queen, and eventually become Weyrwoman of Benden. As the deadly Threads begin to turn again, the bold dragonriders take to the air, belching flames that destroy the strands before they touch the ground. Anne McCaffrey is the winner of the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, and the Margaret Edwards Lifetime Achievement Award. Few are better at mixing elements of high fantasy and hard science fiction.... -- The New York Times Book Review	6	1967			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177001.Dragonflight_Dragonquest
