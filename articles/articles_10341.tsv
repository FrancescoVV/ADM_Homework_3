Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk		Ben Fountain	3.80	28291	3491	Billy Lynn's Long Half-Time Walk is a razor-sharp satire set in Texas during America's war in Iraq. It explores the gaping national disconnect between the war at home and the war abroad. Ben Fountainâ€™s remarkable debut novel follows the surviving members of the heroic Bravo Squad through one exhausting stop in their media-intensive "Victory Tour" at Texas Stadium, football mecca of the Dallas Cowboys, their fans, promoters, and cheerleaders.	307	May 1st 2012	Billy Lynn	Dallas, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13325079-billy-lynn-s-long-halftime-walk
