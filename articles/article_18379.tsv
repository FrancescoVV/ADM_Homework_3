The Suspect		Andrew C. Nye	4.43	7	2	The poems in this volume were found in a manila envelope packed in an unaddressed 13" x 11" x 3" USPS medium flat-rate box covered in a 99% cotton burgundy and gold tablecloth at the bottom of an antique steamer trunk inside the basement residence of a bookseller. Authorities came across the documents while searching the bookseller's apartment after neighbors had reported him missing. The bookseller was last seen walking with an orange tabby on a street in the rainy part of Seattle. When questioned about the matter, all known aquaintances had no idea that the bookseller had ever owned a steamer trunk.	21	July 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11919653-the-suspect
