Breathe	Colorado Mountain #4	Kristen Ashley	4.35	34522	2255	There's nothing like the first time . . . In Carnal, Colorado, Faye Goodknight is the town's quiet, shy librarian. She may also be Carnal's last remaining virgin. For years, Faye has had a crush on Chace Keaton, but the gorgeous cop has always been unattainable. She's resigned to live contentedly with only her books for company-until Faye suddenly meets Chace alone in the woods . . . Chace doesn't think he's the good guy everyone believes him to be. He's made a lot of choices he regrets, including denying his feelings for Faye. Through his choices, he's come to believe the pretty librarian is too good for him, but after their time in the woods, Chace realizes that she may be his last chance for redemption. Soon, their long simmering desires grow to a burning passion. Yet always casting a shadow over their happiness is Chace's dark past . . .	554	January 1st 2012	Tyrell "Ty" Walker, Alexa "Lexie" Berry, Tatum "Tate" Jackson, Lauren Grahame, Nina Sheridan, Holden "Max" Maxwell, Faye Goodknight, Chace Keaton	Carnal, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15742039-breathe
