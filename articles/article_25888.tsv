Graceful (for Young Women): Letting Go of Your Try-Hard Life		Emily P. Freeman	4.38	431	59	You know her--the good girl. She's the reliable one who shows up every week at youth group wearing a purity ring and a smile. She gets good grades, makes the team, and doesn't need to be told to come home on time. But deep down she is crushed by the weight of the responsibility to be the good one, the smart one, the one who never messes up. With the same candor and gentle spirit she showed women in Grace for the Good Girl , Emily Freeman now gives young women what they need to be free on the inside, no matter what's going on outside. Through an honest look at the roles girls play, she helps them learn to stop trying and start trusting that the Jesus who came to save them also comes to live with them, right here and now.	171	September 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789008-graceful-for-young-women
