The Man Who Loved Children		Christina Stead, Randall Jarrell	3.57	3962	462	Every family lives in an evolving story, told by all its members, inside a landscape of portentous events and characters. Their view of themselves is not shared by people looking from outside in--visitors, and particularly not relatives--for they have to see something pretty humdrum, even if, as in this case, the fecklessness they complain of is extreme.	527	1940	Sam Pollit, Henny Pollit, Louie Pollit	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/304344.The_Man_Who_Loved_Children
