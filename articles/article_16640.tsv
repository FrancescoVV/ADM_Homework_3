Freddy and the Ignormus	Freddy the Pig #8	Walter R. Brooks, Kurt Wiese	4.20	358	28	A mysterious and fearsome creature called the Ignormus is living in the Big Woods. No one has actually gotten a good look at it but, because of the Ignormus, the animals live in terror of going into the Big Woods. Freddy the Pig makes the mistake of borrowing Mr. Bean's gun without permission for protection in the Big Woods and loses it. To make matters worse, someone leaves a bag of stolen oats in the pig pen and everyone, including Mr. Bean, believes that Freddy is the thief. From 1927 to 1958, Walter R. Brooks wrote 26 books starring one of the great characters in American children's literature: Freddy the Pig. The Freddy books, widely beloved as classics and deemed the American equivalent of the Pooh stories, are a remarkable achievement in children's literature.	288	September 9th 1941			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90608.Freddy_and_the_Ignormus
