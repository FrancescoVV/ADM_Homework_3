Nuclear Peace: The Story of the Trident Three		John  Mayer	5.00	4	2	In 1999 three middle-aged women disarmed the Trident Thermonuclear Submarine Fleet on a quiet Scottish Loch. Politicians and campaigners around the world watched their subsequent arrest and trial. The peace campaigners who undertook this direct action took the unprecedented step of suing the British government under international law for crimes against humanity. What emerges is an extraordinary story with the most wide-ranging implications of any act of disarmament since the formation of the anti-nuclear movement. This book is written by the man closest to the Trident Three—their lawyer. Using the highest laws in the world—the Nuremberg Principles and the reasoning handed down by the World Court—John Mayer’s argument persuaded independent judiciary that nuclear weapons lie outside the bounds of international law.	288	May 9th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1608094.Nuclear_Peace
