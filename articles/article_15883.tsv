Calamity Jack	Rapunzel's Revenge #2	Shannon Hale, Dean Hale, Nathan Hale	3.90	5341	632	Jack likes to think of himself as a criminal mastermind...with an unfortunate amount of bad luck. A schemer, plotter, planner, trickster, swindler...maybe even thief? One fine day Jack picks a target a little more giant than the usual, and one little bean turns into a great big building-destroying beanstalk. With help from Rapunzel (and her trusty braids), a pixie from Jack's past, and a man with inventions from the future, they just might out-swindle the evil giants and put his beloved city back in the hands of good people ....while catapulting themselves and readers into another fantastical adventure.	144	January 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327801-calamity-jack
