My Mother's House & Sido		Colette, Enid McLeod, Una Vicenzo Troubridge	4.19	755	53	In My Mother's House and Sido , Colette plays fictional variations on the themes of childhood, family, and, above all, her mother. Vividly alive, fond of cities, music, theater, and books, Sido devoted herself to her village, Saint-Saveur; to her garden, with its inhabitants and its animals; and, especially, to her children, particularly her youngest, whom she called Minet-Chéri. Unlike Gigi and Chéri , which focus largely on sexual love and its repercussions, My Mother's House and Sido center on the compelling figure of a powerful, nurturing woman in late-nineteenth-century rural France, conveying the impact she had on her community and on her daughter -- who grew up to be a great writer.	248	1930		France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89838.My_Mother_s_House_Sido
