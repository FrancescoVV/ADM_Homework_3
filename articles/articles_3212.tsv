The City and the Stars		Arthur C. Clarke	4.09	28121	1066	Clarke's masterful evocation of the far future of humanity, considered his finest novel. Men had built cities before, but never such a city as Diaspar. For millennia its protective dome shut out the creeping decay and danger of the world outside. Once, it held powers that rule the stars. But then, as legend has it, the invaders came, driving humanity into this last refuge. It takes one man, a Unique, to break through Diaspar's stifling inertia, to smash the legend and discover the true nature of the Invaders.	255	October 1956	Alvin, Khedron, Jeserac, Alystra, Hilvar, Seranis, Krif, Vanamonde	Diaspar, Lys	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250024.The_City_and_the_Stars
