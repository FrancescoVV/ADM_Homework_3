Confessions of a Bronx Bookie		Billy O'Connor	4.37	38	8	"Take a riotous roller-coaster ride with a Damon Runyonesque uni-polar manic maniac and his merry band of co-conspirators, on a journey from the 50's Bronx, through the Viet Nam era, and back. An un-abashed gambler, addict, alcoholic, misogynist and lover of women, who looks at calamity, laughs and leaps in with both feet. Lady Luck loves a hustler, and Connor Kelly charmed the panties off her, her sister, and her cousin too! Roller coasters can go off the rails or come to a dead stop, but in this case re-birth and redemption starts a whole new ride." -- James D'Esterhazy	310	December 11th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23812072-confessions-of-a-bronx-bookie
