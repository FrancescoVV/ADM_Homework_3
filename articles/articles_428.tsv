Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children	Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children #1	Ransom Riggs	3.91	983099	61414	Alternate Cover edition for ISBN 9781594744761 A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of very curious photographs. It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow-impossible though it seems-they may still be alive. A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.	352	June 7th 2011	Olive Abroholos Elephanta, Fiona Waters, Horace Somnusson, Millard Nullings, Jacob Portman, Emma Bloom, Alma Lefay Peregrine, Abraham Portman, Bronwyn Bruntley, Enoch O'Connor, Ferdinand Portman, Hugh Apiston, Claire Densmore, Miss Avocet	Englewood, Florida (United States), Wales	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9460487-miss-peregrine-s-home-for-peculiar-children
