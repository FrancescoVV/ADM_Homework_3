Conspiracy in Death	In Death #8	J.D. Robb	4.35	33637	1179	Streetwise cop Eve Dallas and her trusty sidekick Peabody face a methodical killer in this latest addition to the In Death series by J.D. Robb, better known as the bestselling author Nora Roberts. In the late 21st century, on the streets of New York City, a street sleeper is found murdered, his diseased heart removed with surgical precision. His death would typically drop to the bottom of a list of senseless and inexplicable killings, but Lieutenant Dallas, who "would stand for the dead and the living," is not about to let that happen. When her research uncovers similar crimes in several cities that were dropped under mysterious circumstances, Dallas knows she's facing a killer cruel enough to prey on the weakest in society and powerful enough to conspire an extensive coverup. To complicate matters further, Dallas faces an equally troubling threat to her career when she's linked to the death of a fellow cop. Now she must fight to restore her good name as well as track down the killer. In Conspiracy in Death, Roberts creates a futuristic world of evil that Eve Dallas negotiates through tough talk and brute force. While Robb crafts the crimes with great care, she assumes a familiarity with the characters that new readers will lack. But fans of the In Death series and newcomers alike will enjoy the thrill of the chase as Eve Dallas sets out to get her man.	364	January 1st 1999	Eve Dallas, Roarke, Delia Peabody, Ryan Feeney, Don Webster, Charlotte Mira, Ian McNab, Commander Jack Whitney, Mavis Freestone, Louise Dimatto, Nadine Furst, Lawrence Charles Summerset, Leonardo (designer), David Baxter, Troy Trueheart, Chief Harrison Tibble, Dr. Morris	New York City, New York (United States), Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/172691.Conspiracy_in_Death
