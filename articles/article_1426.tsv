The Illuminatus! Trilogy	Illuminatus! #1-3	Robert Shea, Robert Anton Wilson	4.01	14485	816	It was a deadly mistake. Joseph Malik, editor of a radical magazine, had snooped into rumors about an ancient secret society that was still alive and kicking. Now his offices have been bombed, he's missing, and the case has landed in the lap of a tough, cynical, streetwise New York detective. Saul Goodman knows he's stumbled onto something big—but even he can't guess how far into the pinnacles of power this conspiracy of evil has penetrated. Filled with sex and violence—in and out of time and space—the three books of The Illuminatus! Trilogy are only partly works of the imagination. They tackle all the cover-ups of our time—from who really shot the Kennedys to why there's a pyramid on a one-dollar bill—and suggest a mind-blowing truth.	805	1975	George Dorn, Joseph Malik, Hagbard Celine, Saul Goodman, Barney Muldoon, Simon Moon, Stella Maris, John Dillinger		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57913.The_Illuminatus_Trilogy
