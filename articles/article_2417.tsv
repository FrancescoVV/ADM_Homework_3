The Tortilla Curtain		T. Coraghessan Boyle	3.66	27882	3383	Topanga Canyon is home to two couples on a collision course. Los Angeles liberals Delaney and Kyra Mossbacher lead an ordered sushi-and-recycling existence in a newly gated hilltop community: he a sensitive nature writer, she an obsessive realtor. Mexican illegals Cándido and América Rincón desperately cling to their vision of the American Dream as they fight off starvation in a makeshift camp deep in the ravine. And from the moment a freak accident brings Cándido and Delaney into intimate contact, these four and their opposing worlds gradually intersect in what becomes a tragicomedy of error and misunderstanding.	355	1995	Delany Mossbacher, Candido Rincon, America Rincon	California (United States), Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24731.The_Tortilla_Curtain
