I Am Not Myself These Days		Josh Kilmer-Purcell	3.97	12222	956	The New York Times bestselling, darkly funny memoir of a young New Yorker's daring dual life—advertising art director by day, glitter-dripping drag queen and nightclub beauty-pageant hopeful by night—was a smash literary debut for Josh Kilmer-Purcell, now known for his popular Planet Green television series The Fabulous Beekman Boys . His story begins here—before the homemade goat milk soaps and hand-gathered honeys, before his memoir of the city mouse’s move to the country, The Bucolic Plague —in I Am Not Myself These Days , with “plenty of dishy anecdotes and moments of tragi-camp delight” ( WashingtonPost ).	305	2006		New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109520.I_Am_Not_Myself_These_Days
