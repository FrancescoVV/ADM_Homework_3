Princess of Glass	The Princesses of Westfalin Trilogy #2	Jessica Day George	4.06	20696	1782	Hoping to escape the troubles in her kingdom, Princess Poppy reluctantly agrees to take part in a royal exchange program, whereby young princes and princesses travel to each other's countries in the name of better political alliances--and potential marriages. It's got the makings of a fairy tale--until a hapless servant named Eleanor is tricked by a vengeful fairy godmother into competing with Poppy for the eligible prince. Ballgowns, cinders, and enchanted glass slippers fly in this romantic and action-packed happily-ever-after quest from an author with a flair for embroidering tales in her own delightful way.	266	May 25th 2010	Princess Poppy, Prince Christian, Eleanor	Breton	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7199667-princess-of-glass
