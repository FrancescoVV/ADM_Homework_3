Prophecy of the Sisters	Prophecy of the Sisters #1	Michelle Zink	3.55	14769	1525	An ancient prophecy divides two sisters- One good... One evil... Who will prevail? Twin sisters Lia and Alice Milthorpe have just become orphans. They have also become enemies. As they discover their roles in a prophecy that has turned generations of sisters against each other, the girls find themselves entangled in a mystery that involves a tattoo-like mark, their parents' deaths, a boy, a book, and a lifetime of secrets. Lia and Alice don't know whom they can trust. They just know they can't trust each other.	343	August 1st 2009	Alice Milthorpe, Amalia "Lia" Milthorpe, Henry Milthorpe	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5271066-prophecy-of-the-sisters
