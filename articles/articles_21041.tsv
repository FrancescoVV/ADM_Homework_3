The Terrible Two Get Worse	The Terrible Two #2	Mac Barnett, Jory John, Kevin Cornell	4.27	2014	235	Two pranksters are better than one in the second book in the hilarious New York Times bestselling series by Mac Barnett and Jory John! Miles Murphy and Niles Sparks are great at being terrible. Nearly every day the fearsome pranking duo turns Yawnee Valley Science and Letters Academy upside down with their stunts. The Big Chirp. The Cafeteria Calamity. Their pranks bring joy to their classmates and embarrassment to their nemesis: blowhard Principal Barkin. But one day—school picture day, to be precise—a scheme goes too far, and Principal Barkin ends up fired. His replacement: Principal Barkin Senior, the principal’s no-nonsense father. The new principal runs the school with an iron fist, out to destroy all signs of fun. No group work. No Pajama Day. And definitely no pranking. In this second book in the sly and silly illustrated series, bestselling authors Mac Barnett and Jory John prove once again that pranks in the hands of the powerless can be tools of justice—and hilarity.	224	January 12th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24795872-the-terrible-two-get-worse
