F Wall Street: Joe Ponzio's No-Nonsense Approach to Value Investing For the Rest of Us		Joel Ponzio	4.14	229	16	"Look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy; profit from folly rather than participate in it." —Warren Buffett Investors shouldn't hate the market because of its up and downs. They should capitalize on it—and give a middle finger to those brokers wasting their time (and money) buying and selling, viewing investing as just buying stocks and not taking ownership of a company. In this book, Joe Ponzio gives an "f-you" to Wall Street and teaches you how to become a sharp value investor who uses economic downturns to your advantage. By buying into companies you believe in—but that may be selling for less than their intrinsic value, like high-end retailers in a weak market and discount retailers in a strong one—you will profit from their long-term performance. It's the perfect guide for anyone fed up with Wall Street's bull.	288	January 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5184603-f-wall-street
