The Woman in the Wall		Patrice Kindl	3.83	2121	220	Anna is more than shy. She is nearly invisible. At seven, terrified of school, Anna retreats within the walls of her family's enormous house, and builds a world of passageways and hidden rooms. As the years go by, people forget she ever existed. Then a mysterious note is thrust through a crack in the wall, and Anna must decide whether or not to come out of hiding. Patrice Kindl's astounding, inventive novel blends fantasy and reality -- and readers will not forget it.	192	March 31st 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444337.The_Woman_in_the_Wall
