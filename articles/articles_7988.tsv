Penelope Gilbert and the Children of Azure		Emily A. Steward	4.48	33	19	When 13 year-old Penelope Gilbert accidentally transforms into a stapler during math class, she’s sure she's going crazy. But she’s not imagining the men in black suits now patrolling the halls at school, nor is she imagining the new substitute teacher who orders the class to take a special new test. A test that requires blood. Hunted for her powers, and torn from the life she knows, Penny is swept up into a world in the clouds where magic meets machine and pirates rule the sky.	250	September 7th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32783368-penelope-gilbert-and-the-children-of-azure
