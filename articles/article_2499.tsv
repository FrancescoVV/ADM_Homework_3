The Name of the Star	Shades of London #1	Maureen Johnson	3.88	49052	5243	Jack the Ripper is back, and he's coming for Rory next.... Louisiana teenager Rory Deveaux arrives in London to start a new life at boarding school just as a series of brutal murders mimicking the horrific Jack the Ripper killing spree of more than a century ago has broken out across the city. The police are left with few leads and no witnesses. Except one. Rory spotted the man believed to be the prime suspect. But she is the only one who saw him - the only one who can see him. And now Rory has become his next target...unless she can tap her previously unknown abilities to turn the tables.	372	September 29th 2011	Jerome, Aurora "Rory" Deveaux, Julianne "Jazza" Benton, Stephen Dene, Bhuvana “Boo” Chodhari, Callum Mitchell	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13595639-the-name-of-the-star
