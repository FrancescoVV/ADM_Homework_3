Linden Hills		Gloria Naylor	4.03	2378	141	A world away from Brewster Place, yet intimately connected to it, lies Linden Hills. With its showcase homes, elegant lawns, and other trappings of wealth, Linden Hills is not unlike other affluent black communities. But residence in this community is indisputable evidence of "making it." Although no one knows what the precise qualifications are, everyone knows that only certain people get to live there—and that they want to be among them. Once people get to Linden Hills, the quest continues, more subtle, but equally fierce: the goal is a house on Tupelo Drive, the epitome of achievement and visible success. No one notices that the property on Tupelo Drive goes back on sale quickly; no one questions why there are always vacancies at Linden Hills. In a resonant novel that takes as its model Dante's Inferno , Gloria Naylor reveals the truth about the American dream—that the price of success may very well be a journey down to the lowest circle of hell.	304	1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/765810.Linden_Hills
