A Heart So White		Javier Marías, Margaret Jull Costa	4.01	8568	840	Javier Marías's A Heart So White chronicles with unnerving insistence the relentless power of the past. Juan knows little of the interior life of his father Ranz; but when Juan marries, he begins to consider the past anew, and begins to ponder what he doesn't really want to know. Secrecy—its possible convenience, its price, and even its civility—hovers throughout the novel. A Heart So White becomes a sort of anti-detective story of human nature. Intrigue; the sins of the father; the fraudulent and the genuine; marriage and strange repetitions of violence: Marías elegantly sends shafts of inquisitory light into the shadows and on to the costs of ambivalence. ("My hands are of your colour; but I shame/To wear a heart so white"—Shakespeare's Macbeth .)	280	February 13th 1992	Custardoy, Juan Ranz, Luisa, Ranz, Berta, Teresa, Professor Villalobos, Miriam, Guillermo	Madrid (Spain), Havana (Cuba), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/529075.A_Heart_So_White
