This World We Live In	Last Survivors #3	Susan Beth Pfeffer	3.80	29366	2674	It’s been a year since a meteor collided with the moon, catastrophically altering the earth’s climate. For Miranda Evans, life as she knew it no longer exists. Her friends and neighbors are dead, the landscape is frozen, and food is increasingly scarce. The struggle to survive intensifies when Miranda’s father and stepmother arrive with a baby and three strangers in tow. One of the newcomers is Alex Morales, and as Miranda’s complicated feelings for him turn to love, his plans for his future thwart their relationship. Then a devastating tornado hits the town of Howell, and Miranda makes a decision that will change their lives forever.	256	April 1st 2010	Alex Morales, Miranda Evans	Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6393972-this-world-we-live-in
