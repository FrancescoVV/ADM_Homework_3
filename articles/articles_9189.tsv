City of Glass	New York Trilogy #1	Paul Auster	3.79	15220	970	Nominated for an Edgar award for best mystery of the year, City of Glass inaugurates an intriguing New York Trilogy of novels that The Washington Post Book World has classified as "post-existentialist private eye... It's as if Kafka has gotten hooked on the gumshoe game and penned his own ever-spiraling version." As a result of a strange phone call in the middle of the night, Quinn, a writer of detective stories, becomes enmeshed in a case more puzzling than any he might have written. Written with hallucinatory clarity, City of Glass combines dark humor with Hitchcock-like suspense. Ghosts and The Locked Room are the next two brilliant installments in Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy .	203	1985	Daniel Quinn, Peter Stillman, Peter Stillman Jr., Virginia Stillman, Paul Auster	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/432.City_of_Glass
