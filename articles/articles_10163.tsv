The Anatomical Shape of a Heart		Jenn Bennett	3.94	15523	2005	Beatrix Adams knows exactly how she’s spending the summer before her senior year. Determined to follow in Da Vinci’s footsteps, she’s ready to tackle the one thing that will give her an advantage in a museum-sponsored scholarship contest: drawing actual cadavers. But when she tries to sneak her way into the hospital’s Willed Body program and misses the last metro train home, she meets a boy who turns her summer plans upside down. Jack is charming, wildly attractive, and possibly one of San Francisco’s most notorious graffiti artists. On midnight buses and city rooftops, Beatrix begins to see who Jack really is—and tries to uncover what he’s hiding that leaves him so wounded. But will these secrets come back to haunt him? Or will the skeletons in her family’s closet tear them apart?	304	November 3rd 2015	Katherine Adams, Health Adams, Andy Wong, Jillian Vincent, Jackson Vincent, Lars Van Asch, Marlena Vincent, David Vincent, Beatrix Adams	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23310763-the-anatomical-shape-of-a-heart
