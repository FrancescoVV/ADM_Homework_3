Siempre Unidos, La Isla De Los Elfos	Forgotten Realms	Elaine Cunningham	3.91	1507	37	Serene, beautiful, inviolate. Rich in magic and treasure, to those who hear of its legends it is the ultimate paradise. To the beleaguered elves of Toril it is the ultimate refuge. But to many it is the ultimate prize. At the heart of its story is Amlaruil, Queen of All Elves. When Evermeet comes under massive, devastating attack, her sacrifice holds the last hope of saving the elven homeland.	480	April 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19857.Evermeet
