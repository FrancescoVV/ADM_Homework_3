Archenemies	Renegades #2	Marissa Meyer	4.30	33911	4737	The Renegades Trilogy continues, in this fiercely awaited second installment after the New York Times-bestselling Renegades by Marissa Meyer, author of the Lunar Chronicles. Time is running out. Together, they can save the world. But they each other's worst nightmare. In Renegades, Nova and Adrian (aka Insomnia and Sketch) fought the battle of their lives against the Anarchist known as the Detonator. It was a short-lived victory. The Anarchists still have a secret weapon, one that Nova believes will protect her. The Renegades also have a strategy for overpowering the Anarchists, but both Nova and Adrian understand that it could mean the end of Gatlon City - and the world - as they know it.	560	November 6th 2018	Adrian Everhart, Danna Bell, Ruby Tucker, Hugh Everhart, Simon Westwood, Kasumi Hasegawa, Winston Pratt, Honey Harper, Max Everhart, Tamaya Rae, Leroy Flinn, Nova Artino, Oscar Silva, Genissa Clark, Mack Baxter, Trevor Dunn, Raymond Stern, Phobia, Hawthorn, Evander Wade	Gatlon City	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35425827-archenemies
