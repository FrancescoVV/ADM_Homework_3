Millennium Approaches	Angels in America #1	Tony Kushner	4.29	19583	362	Angels in America is a play in two parts by American playwright Tony Kushner. The play is a complex, often metaphorical, and at times symbolic examination of AIDS and homosexuality in America in the 1980s. Certain major and minor characters are supernatural beings (angels) or deceased persons (ghosts). The play contains multiple roles for several of the actors. Initially and primarily focusing on a gay couple in Manhattan, the play also has several other storylines, some of which occasionally intersect.	119	February 13th 1992		New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92250.Millennium_Approaches
