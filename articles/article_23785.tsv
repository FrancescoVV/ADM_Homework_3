Who Owns Arizona?: A Drew Steele Civil War Mystery	Drew Steele Civil War Mystery #1	E.E. Doc Murdock	3.80	5	1	Who Owns Arizona is a murder mystery set in the American West during the traumatic post-Civil War period. This fast-paced story has more twists and turns than a runaway river in flood stage. It begins in San Francisco when Drew Steele, a Civil War-veteran turned detective, is hired by newspaperman John Rudd to go to the Arizona territory to find a long-lost Spanish land grant that supposedly lays claim to the entire Arizona territory. Murders ensue, and Steele suspects the motive may be related to the missing Spanish land grant. Steele confronts hired gunslingers, marauding Indians, and of course, a number of beautiful, but dangerous, women as he searches for an illusive and exceptionally clever serial killer. Who Owns Arizona is a murder mystery in the classic mold.	330	January 15th 2013		Arizona (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17297873-who-owns-arizona
