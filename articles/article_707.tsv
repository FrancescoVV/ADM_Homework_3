Ivanhoe	Waverley Novels #5	Walter Scott, Graham Tulloch	3.75	87740	2419	For this novel, Scott moved far away from the setting of his own turbulent time. He went back to the late 12th century, and to England rather than the Scottish settings of all his previous novels. He connected his writing Ivanhoe with his concerns about contemporary events. Scott drew together the apparently opposing themes of historical reality and chivalric romance, social realism and high adventure, past and present.	541	1819	Little John, Robin of Locksley, Richard I of England, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, John of England, Rebecca of York, Isaac of York, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, Cedric of Rotherwood, Maurice De Bracy, Waldemar Fitzurse, Maid Marion, Black Knight, Prince John Lackland, Robert von der Normandie, Bruder Gurth, Iorlvaux, Le Noir-Fain√©ant, Ivanhoe	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6440.Ivanhoe
