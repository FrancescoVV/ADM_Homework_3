The Proverbial Mr. Universe		Maria La Serra	3.73	84	61	Dear girl with the red scarf, Love was never meant to be conquered, you have to surrender to it. Trust me. After all, I am Mr. Universe... When the universe conveys a message, you listen. Olivia just caught her fiancé cheating. Now she needs to question what she wants out of life and love. Striving to live up to her father’s unrealistic standards, every decision she has ever made was with her father’s wishes in mind—until she finds mysterious, handwritten letters tucked away in places only meant for her. That’s when she realizes she’s been on the wrong path all along. Washed-up abstract artist Nick Montgomery has had quite a few setbacks in life. He’s become accustomed to needing no one—until he meets the girl with the red scarf. She’s not his type. But the universe has other ideas. Nick has a secret he’s keeping from her, afraid it will bring their new relationship to a sudden halt. Will they figure out what the Universe holds for them?	239	2016		Montreal, Quebec (Montréal, Québec) (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40499795-the-proverbial-mr-universe
