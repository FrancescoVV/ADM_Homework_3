More Than Him	More Than #3	Jay McLean	4.33	15792	1012	"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us." - Marianne Williamson We live in a world of darkness and shadows, where monsters hide and aim to ruin. And they did. They ruined us and turned our dreams into nightmares. But now we're back. And we're fighting. Not just for us, or for each other, but for our light.	264	January 27th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18879990-more-than-him
