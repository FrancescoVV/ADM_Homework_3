Our Nig		Harriet E. Wilson, P. Gabrielle Foreman, Reginald Pitts	3.72	2472	151	Our Nig is the tale of a mixed-race girl, Frado, abandoned by her white mother after the death of the child's black father. Frado becomes the servant of the Bellmonts, a lower-middle-class white family in the free North, while slavery is still legal in the South, and suffers numerous abuses in their household. Frado's story is a tragic one; having left the Bellmonts, she eventually marries a black fugitive slave, who later abandons her.	176	1859			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369783.Our_Nig
