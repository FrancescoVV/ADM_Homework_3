Orange Is the New Black		Piper Kerman	3.71	183151	14574	With a career, a boyfriend, and a loving family, Piper Kerman barely resembles the reckless young woman who delivered a suitcase of drug money ten years before. But that past has caught up with her. Convicted and sentenced to fifteen months at the infamous federal correctional facility in Danbury, Connecticut, the well-heeled Smith College alumna is now inmate #11187–424 — one of the millions of people who disappear “down the rabbit hole” of the American penal system. From her first strip search to her final release, Kerman learns to navigate this strange world with its strictly enforced codes of behavior and arbitrary rules. She meets women from all walks of life, who surprise her with small tokens of generosity, hard words of wisdom, and simple acts of acceptance. Heartbreaking, hilarious, and at times enraging, Kerman’s story offers a rare look into the lives of women in prison—why it is we lock so many away and what happens to them when they’re there.	298	April 6th 2010	Piper Kerman, Larry, Nora Jansen, Pop	Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, Connecticut (United States), Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (United States), Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6314763-orange-is-the-new-black
