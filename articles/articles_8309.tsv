Two different weddings. Two possible futures. She’s at a crossroads. Be maid of honor at her best friend’s wedding or crash her ex’s? Gemma’s decision, unknown to her, hinges on a delayed flight and a chance meeting. Now her life is about to go down two parallel tracks—will Gemma fly toward a life with her first love or a future with a man she’s not even met yet? Love Connection is a feel good Romantic Comedy about one woman, life’s infinite possibilities, and the destiny that lies beyond two different choices.	240	October 8th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35145573-love-connection
