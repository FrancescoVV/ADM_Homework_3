Prince of the Atlantic: An Epic Novel Based on the True Exploits of Captain Luke Ryan Irish Swashbuckler & American Patriot Benjamin Franklin's Most Dangerous Privateer	Captain Luke Ryan #2	Mark M. McMillin	3.75	4	2	Here is a true story based on the adventures of Captain Luke Ryan - Irish swashbuckler, American patriot, mariner extraordinaire and Benjamin Franklin's most dangerous privateer... It is an epic story about war, heroism, love, intrigue and betrayal spanning a period from the American Revolution, to the French Revolution, and through the rise of Napoleon. The year is 1779 and the American Colonies are losing their life and death struggle for independence from Great Britain. Their rag-tag armies are in retreat. Their small navy has been swept from the seas. The fate of a fragile nation, the fate of the Revolution, hangs by a thread. In walks Ryan with his fast ships and iron men eager to fight the British for their own reasons. Before they are finished Ryan and his men will capture or destroy over 100 British ships, take hundreds of prisoners and invade English and Scottish towns - tying down precious military resources, causing financial panic in London and inflicting more damage on British maritime interests than perhaps any other naval force during the war. The story is told in three books: Gather the Shadowmen (The Lords of the Ocean), Prince of the Atlantic and Napoleon's Gold (which can be read in or out of sequence).	327	August 7th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43178903-prince-of-the-atlantic
