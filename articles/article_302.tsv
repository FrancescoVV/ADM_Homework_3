Different Seasons		Stephen King	4.34	177947	4610	Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption--the most satisfying tale of unjust imprisonment and offbeat escape since The Count of Monte Cristo. Apt Pupil--a golden California schoolboy and an old man whose hideous past he uncovers enter into a fateful and chilling mutual parasitism. The Body--four rambunctious young boys venture into the Maine woods and in sunlight and thunder find life, death, and intimations of their own mortality. The Breathing Method--a tale told in a strange club about a woman determined to give birth no matter what. source: stephenking.com	560	August 27th 1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39662.Different_Seasons
