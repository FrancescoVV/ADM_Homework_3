Quadrivium: The Four Classical Liberal Arts of Number, Geometry, Music, & Cosmology	Wooden Books	John Martineau, Miranda Lundy, Daud Sutton, Anthony Ashton, Jason Martineau	4.27	824	57	The quadrivium-the classical curriculum-comprises the four liberal arts of number, geometry, music, and cosmology. It was studied from antiquity to the Renaissance as a way of glimpsing the nature of reality. Geometry is number in space; music is number in time; and comology expresses number in space and time. Number, music, and geometry are metaphysical truths: life across the universe investigates them; they foreshadow the physical sciences. Quadrivium is the first volume to bring together these four subjects in many hundreds of years. Composed of six successful titles in the Wooden Books series- Sacred Geometry , Sacred Number , Harmonograph , The Elements of Music , Platonic & Archimedean Solids , and A Little Book of Coincidence -it makes ancient wisdom and its astonishing interconnectedness accessible to us today. Beautifully produced in six different colors of ink, Quadrivium will appeal to anyone interested in mathematics, music, astronomy, and how the universe works.	415	October 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7962457-quadrivium
