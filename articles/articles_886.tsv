The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao		Junot Díaz	3.90	231210	19471	Things have never been easy for Oscar, a sweet but disastrously overweight, lovesick Dominican ghetto nerd. From his home in New Jersey, where he lives with his old-world mother and rebellious sister, Oscar dreams of becoming the Dominican J. R. R. Tolkien and, most of all, of finding love. But he may never get what he wants, thanks to the Fukœ—the curse that has haunted the Oscar's family for generations, dooming them to prison, torture, tragic accidents, and, above all, ill-starred love. Oscar, still waiting for his first kiss, is just its most recent victim. Diaz immerses us in the tumultuous life of Oscar and the history of the family at large, rendering with genuine warmth and dazzling energy, humor, and insight the Dominican-American experience, and, ultimately, the endless human capacity to persevere in the face of heartbreak and loss. A true literary triumph, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao confirms Junot Diaz as one of the best and most exciting voices of our time.	335	September 6th 2007	Oscar de León, Lola de León, Hypatía Belicia "Beli" Cabral de León, La Inca, Yunior de Las Casas, Ybón Pimentel, Dr Abelard Luis Cabral	Dominican Republic, Washington Heights, New York (United States), Paterson, New Jersey (United States), Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey (United States) Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) Baní (Dominican Republic) Samaná (Dominican Republic) Santiago (Dominican Republic), Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey (United States), Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), Baní (Dominican Republic), Samaná (Dominican Republic), Santiago (Dominican Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao
