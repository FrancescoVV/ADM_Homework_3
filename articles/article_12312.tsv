Paint the Wind		Cathy Cash Spellman	4.30	616	68	Born Fran√ßoise Deverell of the Deverells of Louisiana, everyone calls her Fancy. In one night of blood and tears her past will vanish and she will begin an unforgettable journey of the heart. Too beautiful to be innocent, she will be swept into the relentless rhythms of a nation hungry for adventure. Her fortune is bound to the West...untamed, dangerous, and golden with promise. A woman able to steal away a man's breath -- and his reason -- she wants more than love. She wants passion, power, and all the wealth of her dreams. And Fancy Deverell is riding hell-for-leather to have it.	814	1989	Chance Mackenzie (alias McCall), Fancy Deverell, Hart McAllister, Jason Madigan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30321234-paint-the-wind
