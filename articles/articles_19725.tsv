On Her Majesty's Secret Service	James Bond (Original Series) #11	Ian Fleming	3.96	17185	695	The eleventh novel in Ian Fleming’s James Bond series. In the aftermath of Operation Thunderball, Ernst Stavro Blofeld’s trail has gone cold-and so has 007’s love for his job. The only thing that can rekindle his passion is Contessa Teresa ‘Tracy’ di Vicenzo, a troubled young woman who shares his taste for fast cars and danger. She’s the daughter of a powerful crime boss, and he thinks Bond’s hand in marriage may be the solution to all her problems. Bond’s not ready to settle down-yet-but if Tracy’s father can lead him to Blofeld, he’ll consider it. After tracking the SPECTRE chief to a stronghold in the Swiss Alps, Bond uncovers the details of Blofeld’s latest plot: a biological warfare scheme more audacious than anything the fiend has tried before. Now Bond must save the world once again-and survive Blofeld’s last, very personal, act of vengeance.	326	1963	James Bond, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Marc-Ange Draco, Teresa di Vicenzo	Royale-Les-Eaux (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3762.On_Her_Majesty_s_Secret_Service
