Getting the Girl	Wolfe Brothers #3	Markus Zusak	3.70	6198	559	Cameron Wolfe's life gets very complicated when he falls for his brother's girlfriend in this winning, wise novel from the dynamic author of FIGHTING RUBEN WOLFE. Cameron Wolfe is the quiet one in his family, not a soccer star like his brother Steve or a charming fighter with a new girl every week like his brother Rube. Cam would give anything to be near one of those girls, to love her and treat her right. He especially likes Rube's latest, Octavia, with her brilliant ideas and bright green eyes. But what woman like that would want a loser like him? Maybe Octavia would, Cam discovers. Maybe he'd even have something to say. And those maybes change everything: winning, loving, losing, the Wolfe brothers, and Cameron himself.	256	November 30th 2001	Steven Wolfe, Cameron Wolfe, Ruben Wolfe, Sarah Wolfe, Mr Clifford Wolfe, Mrs Wolfe, Octavia Ash	Australia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19062.Getting_the_Girl
