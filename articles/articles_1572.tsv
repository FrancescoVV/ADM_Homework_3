Galápagos		Kurt Vonnegut Jr.	3.86	69274	2854	Galápagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry—and all that is worth saving.	324	1985	Kilgore Trout, Leon Trotsky Trout, James Wait, Andrew MacIntosh	Ecuador, Galapagos (Ecuador)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9593.Gal_pagos
