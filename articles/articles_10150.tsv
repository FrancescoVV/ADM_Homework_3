Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me		Richard Fariña, Thomas Pynchon	3.79	2869	269	Fariña evokes the Sixties as precisely, wittily, and poignantly as F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the Jazz Age. The hero, Gnossus Pappadopoulis, weaves his way through the psychedelic landscape, encountering-among other things-mescaline, women, art, gluttony, falsehood, science, prayer, and, occasionally, truth.	352	April 1966			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/418.Been_Down_So_Long_It_Looks_Like_Up_To_Me
