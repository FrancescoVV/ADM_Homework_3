Flight of the Red Bandit	Geronimo Stilton #56	Geronimo Stilton	4.24	651	27	One hot summer afternoon, I was trying to write, but I just couldn't get inspired. I needed a break! Who would've thought that soon I'd be in Arizona, hanging from cliffs and white-water rafting? Grandfather Shortpaws had sent me on a hunt for his old friend -- the Red Bandit. What a fabumouse adventure!	128	November 30th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17981458-flight-of-the-red-bandit
