Tithe	Modern Faerie Tales #1	Holly Black	3.72	79041	4380	Welcome to the realm of very scary faeries! Sixteen-year-old Kaye is a modern nomad. Fierce and independent, she travels from city to city with her mother's rock band until an ominous attack forces Kaye back to her childhood home. There, amid the industrial, blue-collar New Jersey backdrop, Kaye soon finds herself an unwilling pawn in an ancient power struggle between two rival faerie kingdoms - a struggle that could very well mean her death.	332	October 1st 2002	Kaye Fierch, Ellen Fierch, Cornelius Stone, Rath Roiben Rye, Janet Stone	New Jersey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46777.Tithe
