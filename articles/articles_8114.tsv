Generation Kill: Devil Dogs, Iceman, Captain America, and the New Face of American War		Evan Wright	4.27	15753	819	Another nameless town, another target for First Recon. It's only five in the afternoon, but a sandtorm has plunged everything into a hellish twilight of murky, red dust. On rooftops, in alleyways lurk militiamen with machine guns, AK rifles and the odd rocket-propelled grenade. Artillery bombardment has shattered the town's sewers and rubble is piled up in lagoons of human excrement. It stinks. Welcome to Iraq... Within hours of 9/11, America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion, the first generation dispatched into open-ed combat since Vietnam. They were a new breed of American warrior unrecognizable to their forebears-soldiers raised on hip hop, Internet porn, Marilyn Manson, video games and The Real World, a band of born-again Christians, dopers, Buddhists, and New Agers who gleaned their precepts from kung fu movies and Oprah Winfrey. Cocky, brave, headstrong, wary, and mostly unprepared for the physical, emotional, and moral horrors ahead, the "First Suicide Battalion" would spearhead the blitzkrieg on Iraq, and fight against the hardest resistance Saddam had to offer. Generation Kill is the funny, frightening, and profane firsthand account of these remarkable men, of the personal toll of victory, and of the randomness, brutality, and camaraderie of a new American war.	384	June 17th 2004	Rudy Reyes, Evan Wright, Brad Colbert, Josh Ray Person, Nathaniel Fick, Antonio Espera, Harold James Trombley, Robert Timothy Bryan, Evan Stafford, Walt Hasser, Mike Wynn, Gabe Garza, Jason Lilley, Leandro Baptista, Anthony Jacks, James Chaffin, Stephen Ferrando, Dave McGraw, John Sixta, Bryan Patterson, Ray Griego, Todd Eckloff, Eric Kocher, Larry Shawn Patrick, James Mattis, Meesh		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/543103.Generation_Kill
