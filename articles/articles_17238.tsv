Black List	Scot Harvath #11	Brad Thor	4.22	17745	913	Somewhere deep inside the United States government is a closely guarded list. Members of Congress never get to see it—only the President and a secret team of advisers. Once your name is on the list, it doesn’t come off . . . until you’re dead. Someone has just added counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath’s name. Somehow Harvath must evade the teams dispatched to kill him long enough to untangle who has targeted him and why they want him out of the way. Somewhere, someone, somehow can put all the pieces together. The only question is, will Harvath get to that person before the United States suffers the most withering terrorist attack ever conceived?	371	July 24th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13117308-black-list
