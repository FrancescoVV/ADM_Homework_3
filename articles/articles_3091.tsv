The Place That Gave		Emem Uko	4.37	362	5	Buzzcut, doll face, secret prude and healthy snacks brand ambassador, Theana Green, loses her money, boyfriend, and reputation in a matter of days. She thought her ‘rags to riches’ story would stay on “riches” for a long time. But the discovery of illegal additives in the snacks she promoted kicked her back to the bottom of the pit. The once-beloved doll was now a disliked troll. Even an escape to a distant village in Nigeria couldn’t hide her from mistrust and scheming of the villagers. Her plan to reinvent herself wasn’t working…and a sexy crooner with a face that could melt even the strongest of icebergs refuses to leave her alone! Heartthrob and talented musician, Ramsey Edet makes women lose their cool. Despite his success and fame, his bad reputation kept catching up with him. One sight of Theana looking like a chocolate beauty that walked out of an Afremov painting was all it took to get him interested in what life had to offer after all.	334	May 6th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53344842-the-place-that-gave
