Vanishing Worlds - Annelies' Journal		Nadine   May	5.00	1	0	Annelies' Journal, the latest in the Awakening to our Ascension Series continues the adventure by journeying into the cells of the body to discover what exactly biological consciousness is. Annelies is the ascension workshop facilitator and author of the workbook: The decoding of our body codes of light. Many people awaken to the awesome truth that to survive physically is nothing compared to the challenges of surviving on a soul level. Outer worlds (dark forces) know that, but they lost their soul connections a long way back. They are heading for their own extinction so they have to attach themselves to the souls that are asleep to their true identity in order to return home - because our reality will soon be no more, when the Grand Portal is re-opened.
