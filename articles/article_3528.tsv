By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead		Julie Anne Peters, C.J. Bott	3.87	21495	1900	Daelyn Rice is broken beyond repair, and after a string of botched suicide attempts, she’s determined to get her death right. She starts visiting a website for “completers”— www. through-the-light.com. While she’s on the site, Daelyn blogs about her life, uncovering a history of bullying that goes back to kindergarten. When she’s not on the Web, Daelyn’s at her private school, where she’s known as the freak who doesn’t talk. Then, a boy named Santana begins to sit with her after school while she’s waiting to for her parents to pick her up. Even though she’s made it clear that she wants to be left alone, Santana won’t give up. And it’s too late for Daelyn to be letting people into her life... isn't it? National Book Award finalist Julie Anne Peters shines a light on how bullying can push young people to the very edge.	200	April 1st 2009	Daelyn Rice, Santana		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6609549-by-the-time-you-read-this-i-ll-be-dead
