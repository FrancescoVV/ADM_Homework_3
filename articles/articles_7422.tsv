Hunting Lila	Lila #1	Sarah Alderson	3.94	14207	1177	17-year-old Lila has two secrets she’s prepared to take to the grave. The first is that she can move things just by looking at them. The second is that she’s been in love with her brother’s best friend, Alex, since forever. After a mugging exposes her unique ability, Lila decides to run to the only people she can trust—her brother and Alex. They live in Southern California where they work for a secret organization called The Unit, and Lila discovers that the two of them are hunting down the men who murdered her mother five years before. And that they’ve found them. In a world where nothing and no one is quite as they seem, Lila quickly realizes that she is not alone—there are others out there just like her—people with special powers—and her mother’s killer is one of them…	318	August 4th 2011	Nate Schaper, Lila Loveday, Jack Loveday, Alex Wakeman, Suki Nakamura, Rachel Stirling, Alicia Harmon, Ryder, Bill Fields, Key (Joe Junior), Amber		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10188580-hunting-lila
