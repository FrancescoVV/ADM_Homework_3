The Immortal Rules	Blood of Eden #1	Julie Kagawa	4.07	66133	6122	To survive in a ruined world, she must embrace the darkness Allison Sekemoto survives in the Fringe, the outermost circle of a walled-in city. By day, she and her crew scavenge for food. By night, any one of them could be eaten. Some days, all that drives Allie is her hatred of them —the vampires who keep humans as blood cattle. Until the night Allie herself dies and becomes one of the monsters. Forced to flee her city, Allie must pass for human as she joins a ragged group of pilgrims seeking a legend—a place that might have a cure for the disease that killed off most of civilization and created the rabids, the bloodthirsty creatures who threaten human and vampire alike. And soon Allie will have to decide what and who is worth dying for again. Enter Julie Kagawa's dark and twisted world as an unforgettable journey begins.	485	April 24th 2012	Allison Sekemoto, Stick, Kanin, Jackal, Zeke Crosse		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10215349-the-immortal-rules
