A Wild Sheep Chase	The Rat #3	Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum	3.94	93372	4714	His life was like a recurring nightmare: a train to nowhere. But an ordinary life has a way of taking an extraordinary turn. Add a girl whose ears are so exquisite that, when uncovered, they improve sex a thousand-fold, a runaway friend, a right-wing politico, an ovine-obsessed professor and a manic-depressive in a sheep outfit, implicate them in a hunt for a sheep, that may or may not be running the world, and the upshot is another singular masterpiece from Japan's finest novelist.	353	October 13th 1982		Tokyo (Japan), Sapporo (Japan), Hokkaido (Japan), Junitaki , 1978 (Japan), Junitaki (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11298.A_Wild_Sheep_Chase
