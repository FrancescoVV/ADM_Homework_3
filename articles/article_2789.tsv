Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason	Bridget Jones #2	Helen Fielding	3.59	101038	2566	Lurching from the cappuccino bars of Notting Hill to the blissed-out shores of Thailand, Bridget Jones searches for The Truth in spite of pathetically unevolved men, insane dating theories, and Smug Married advice ("'I'm just calling to say in the potty! In the potty! Well, do it in Daddy's hand, then!'"). She experiences a zeitgeist-esque Spiritual Epiphany somewhere between the pages of "How to Find the Love You Want Without Seeking It" ("can self-help books really self help?"), protective custody, and a lightly chilled Chardonnay.	352	November 18th 1999	Bridget Jones, Mark Darcy	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363752.Bridget_Jones
