My Unexpected Forever	Beaumont #2	Heidi McLaughlin	4.31	18848	1326	I expected a life of music. I expected to raise my son. It took one look to make everything change. I never expected happiness. I never expected to find her. I never expected to feel desire. I never expected I’d be a family man. I never expected to be loved. I never expected to fall in love. They say you should expect the unexpected, I didn’t realize my unexpected would be the forever kind.	270	September 2nd 2013	Katelyn, Harrison James	Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17185556-my-unexpected-forever
