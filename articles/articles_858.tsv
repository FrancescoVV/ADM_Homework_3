Sometimes a Great Notion		Ken Kesey	4.18	20894	1254	The magnificent second novel from the legendary author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest... Following the astonishing success of his first novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , Ken Kesey wrote what Charles Bowden calls "one of the few essential books written by an American in the last half century." This wild-spirited tale tells of a bitter strike that rages through a small lumber town along the Oregon coast. Bucking that strike out of sheer cussedness are the Stampers. Out of the Stamper family's rivalries and betrayals Ken Kesey has crafted a novel with the mythic impact of Greek tragedy.	640	January 1st 1964	Henry Stamper, Hank Stamper, Jonathan Bailey Draeger, Boney Stokes, Viv Stamper, Leeland Stamper	United States of America, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/529626.Sometimes_a_Great_Notion
