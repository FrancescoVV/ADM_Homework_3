Drink Deep	Chicagoland Vampires #5	Chloe Neill	4.09	28593	1871	Clouds are brewing over Cadogan House, and recently turned vampire Merit can’t tell if this is the darkness before the dawn or the calm before the storm. With the city iself in turmoil over paranormals and the state threatening to pass a paranormal registration act, times haven’t been this precarious for vampires since they came out of the closet. If only they could lay low for a bit, and let the mortals calm down. That’s when the waters of Lake Michigan suddenly turn pitch black-and things really start getting ugly. Chicago’s mayor insists it’s nothing to worry about, but Merit knows only the darkest magic could have woven a spell powerful enough to change the very fabric of nature. She’ll have to turn to friends old and new to find out who’s behind this, and stop them before it’s too late for vampires and humans alike.	321	November 1st 2011	Scott Grey, Juliet, Luc (Chicagoland Vampires), Caroline "Merit" Merit, Morgan Greer, Ethan Sullivan, Mallory Carmichael, Catcher Bell, Jeff Christopher, Simon, Lindsey, Jonah, Seth Tate, Chuck Merit, Kelley (Some Girls Bite), Malik Washington, McKetrick, Diane Kowalczyk	Illinois (United States), Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9815702-drink-deep
