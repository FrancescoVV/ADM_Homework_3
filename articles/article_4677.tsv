Fade	Wake #2	Lisa McMann	3.94	49070	2434	SOME NIGHTMARES NEVER END. For Janie and Cabel, real life is getting tougher than the dreams. They're just trying to carve out a little (secret) time together, but no such luck. Disturbing things are happening at Fieldridge High, yet nobody's talking. When Janie taps into a classmate's violent nightmares, the case finally breaks open -- but nothing goes as planned. Not even close. Janie's in way over her head, and Cabe's shocking behavior has grave consequences for them both. Worse yet, Janie learns the truth about herself and her ability -- and it's bleak. Seriously, brutally bleak. Not only is her fate as a dream catcher sealed, but what's to come is way darker than she'd feared....	248	February 10th 2009	Janie Hannagan, Cabel Strumheller, Captain Fran Komisky, Martha Stubin	Michigan (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3657138-fade
