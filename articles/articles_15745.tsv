Judy Moody was in a Mood. Not a Good Mood. A Bad Mood.	Judy Moody #1	Megan McDonald, Peter H. Reynolds	3.96	15219	1001	The book that started it all--now in paperback! Judy Moody was in a mood. Not a good mood. A bad mood. A mad-faced mood. Judy Moody doesn't have high hopes for third grade. But she does have an abundance of individuality and attitude, and when Mr. Todd assigns the class a special Me Project, she really gets a chance to express herself! Megan McDonald's spirited text and Peter Reynolds's wry illustrations will delight any kid who's known a bad mood or a bad day - and managed to laugh anyway.	160	2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/930612.Judy_Moody_was_in_a_Mood_Not_a_Good_Mood_A_Bad_Mood_
