Girl in Hyacinth Blue		Susan Vreeland	3.73	37547	1895	A professor invites a colleague from the art department to his home to view a painting he has kept secret for decades in Susan Vreeland's powerful historical novel, Girl in Hyacinth Blue . The professor swears it's a Vermeer -- but why exactly has he kept it hidden so long? The reasons unfold in a gripping sequence of stories that trace ownership of the work back to Amsterdam during World War II and still further to the moment of the painting's inception.	242	1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321577.Girl_in_Hyacinth_Blue
