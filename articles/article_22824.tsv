Badea	4.47	15	5	"Lilly sat with her eyes fixed on the window, watching snowflakes crowding on the alley in front of the house, and slowly, slowly everything was covered with a fluffy coat of snow. She thought about the letter that she wrote for Santa Claus, about the gifts he would place under the Christmas tree tonight. And then she realized she should ask Santa for something else." "The Tiniest Elf" is the whimsical story of a little girl, her innocent wish, and her adventure to find Santa Claus.	26	October 21st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36282236-the-tiniest-elf
