Orion Surfacing		I James Forrest	4.27	341	5	With rich and colourful detail, Orion Surfacing takes its readers from the cold darkness of space to the lush greenery and welcoming waters of the tropics, as a brilliant young scientist delves into a mystery that has been unravelling in the jungles of Guatemala and beneath the ocean’s waves for more than a thousand years. But just as the pieces start to fall together, the realization that he is not alone in his search threatens to blow his world apart in a hail of bullets, and the fiery whoosh of gasoline igniting on the water’s surface. Undeterred, he continues on with the help of unlikely allies, and mysterious beings whom he struggles to understand. When the dust settles... everything he knows about the world, and himself, will be called into question, and nothing will ever be the same.	349	August 12th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30834524-orion-surfacing
