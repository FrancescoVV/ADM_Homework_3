Hearts of Gold	Brothers and Lovers #2	Catrin Collier	4.33	384	14	Trainee midwife Bethan Powell lives in the shadow of the workhouse during the Depression. It's difficult to say which is harder for her and fellow nurse Laura Ronconi—their grueling work in the hospital, or the frictions and financial hardships at home. Bethan's Communist miner father, rigidly Chapel mother, unruly brothers, and delightful but dubiously honest aunt, and Laura's vast Italian café-running family, cause the girls as much worry as any difficult case or strict ward sister. But working-class Pontypridd agrees on one thing—the "crache," or gentry, who live in the big houses on the Common, may be just the other side of town, but they inhabit a different world. So when Bethan and Laura are smitten by two young doctors, can love really bridge the divide? Or is the pull of family too strong, the gulf too wide?	470	April 21st 1994		The Rhondda Valleys, Wales (United Kingdom), East Prussia , 1939 Pontypridd, Wales , 1930 (United Kingdom) Cardiff, Wales , 1930 (United Kingdom) Pontypridd, Wales (United Kingdom) Swansea, Wales, East Prussia, Pontypridd, Wales (United Kingdom), Cardiff, Wales (United Kingdom), Swansea, Wales	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18154705-hearts-of-gold
