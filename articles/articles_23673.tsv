Feinstein saw and heard it all -- practices, team meetings, strategy sessions, and mid-game huddles -- during Knight's struggle to avoid a losing season. "A Season on the Brink" not only captures the drama and pressure of big-time college basketball but paints a vivid portrait of a complex, brilliant coach walking a fine line between genius and madness.	337	1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75639.A_Season_on_the_Brink
