A Bit of Rough		Lucy Felthouse	3.46	65	16	When Alison meets Andrew ("call me Drew"), she instantly pegs him as a moron. He's a total bad boy and does nothing but chain smoke and brag about his stream of past conquests. Yet, much to her confusion, Alison still finds herself attracted to him. She's not had sex in a while, so Alison figures there's no harm in going home with him to get herself a bit of rough.	17	May 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11328754-a-bit-of-rough
