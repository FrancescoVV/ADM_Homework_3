Beard Science	Winston Brothers #3	Penny Reid	4.44	23816	2767	Make a deal with the devil and you might get what you want, but will it be what you need? Jennifer Sylvester wants one thing, and that one thing is NOT to be Tennessee’s reigning Banana Cake Queen. Ever the perpetual good girl and obedient daughter, Jennifer is buckling under the weight of her social media celebrity, her mother’s ambitions, and her father’s puritanical mandates. Jennifer is officially desperate. And desperate times call for Cletus Winston. Cletus Winston is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery covered in conundrum sauce, and now he’s in a pickle. Despite being convinced of his own omniscience, extortion by the exalted Banana Cake Queen of Green Valley has taken him completely by surprise. So... what’s a maniacal mastermind to do? Likely, the last thing you expect. 'Beard Science' is the third book in the Winston Brothers series, is a full-length romantic comedy novel, and can be read as a standalone.	384	October 11th 2016	Ashley Winston, Drew Runous, Jethro Winston, Billy Winston, Cletus Winston, Duane Winston, Beau Winston, Roscoe Winston, Jessica James, Claire McClure, Sienna Diaz, Jennifer Sylvester, Shelly Sullivan, Repo, Jackson James, Diane Donner-Sylvester, Kip Sylvester, Isaac Sylvester	Green Valley, Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23337872-beard-science
