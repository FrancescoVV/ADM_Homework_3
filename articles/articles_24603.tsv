Edgedancer	The Stormlight Archive #2.5	Brandon Sanderson	4.28	40165	2697	From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, a special gift edition of Edgedancer , a short novel of the Stormlight Archive (previously published in Arcanum Unbounded ). Three years ago, Lift asked a goddess to stop her from growing older--a wish she believed was granted. Now, in Edgedancer , the barely teenage nascent Knight Radiant finds that time stands still for no one. Although the young Azish emperor granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as Darkness, court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can't help heading to Yeddaw when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like her with budding powers. The downtrodden in Yeddaw have no champion, and Lift knows she must seize this awesome responsibility.	272	November 22nd 2016	Lift		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34703445-edgedancer
