Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and Interpretation		Moshe Idel, Harold Bloom	4.67	12	2	In this discussion of Kabbalah - from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism - Moshe Idel considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. He takes as a starting point the fact that the post-biblical Jewish world lost its geographical centre with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual centre, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centred forms of mysticism.	688	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2205663.Absorbing_Perfections
