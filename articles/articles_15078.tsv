History and Utopia		Emil M. Cioran, Richard Howard	3.95	1101	121	In this book, Cioran writes of politics, of history, and of the utopian dream. "A small masterwork . . . a stringent examination of some persistent and murky notions in human history. . . . It is best to read Cioran while sitting. The impact upon the intellect can be temporarily stunning, and motor systems may give way under the assault."—Joseph Patrick Kennedy, Houston Chronicle "Cioran has a claim to be regarded as among the handful of original minds . . . writing today."— New York Times "A sort of final philosopher of the Western world. [Cioran's] statements have the compression of poetry and the audacity of cosmic clowning."— Washington Post E. M. Cioran (1911-1995) was born and educated in Romania and lived in Paris from 1937 until his death. He is the author of numerous works, including On the Heights of Despair , also available from the University of Chicago Press.	126	1960			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455488.History_and_Utopia
