Jesus Among Other Gods: The Absolute Claims of the Christian Message		Ravi Zacharias	4.21	10202	397	In his most important work to date, apologetics scholar and popular speaker Ravi Zacharias shows how the blueprint for life and death itself is found in a true understanding of Jesus. With a simple yet penetrating style, Zacharias uses rich illustrations to celebrate the power of Jesus Christ to transform lives. Jesus Among Other Gods contrasts the truth of Jesus with founders of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, strengthening believers and compelling them to share their faith with our post-modern world.	208	January 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111388.Jesus_Among_Other_Gods
