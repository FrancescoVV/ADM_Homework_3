The Gold Tinderbox		Paul Camster	5.00	3	1	Illustrated in color for the first time-the full background to how the secrets behind Nobel-nominated APOCALYPSE 1st 2nd and 3rd editions were brought together to make a compelling wholly new interpretation of familiar events we all thought we were correctly told about,but,as it turned out , we weren`t. After the Gold Tinderbox is read in full,it becomes obvious WHY we weren`t,and won`t be for a very long time to come.		June 15th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16078616-the-gold-tinderbox
