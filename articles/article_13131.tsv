The Boat Builder's Bed	Wicked in Wellington #1	Kris Pearson	3.69	3753	204	A windy day...a flyaway signboard...a hideous crunch. Sophie Calhoun can't imagine how she'll pay for the damage to the luxurious car. Already cash-strapped, she's struggling to launch her new interior design studio and make a home for her daughter. She's only days away from disaster. Out of the sleek black Jaguar storms super-yacht tycoon Rafe Severino. Steaming mad. Totally gorgeous. And desperately in need of a top-line decorator for his spectacular new harbor-side mansion. Sophie fears her dream contract comes with strings that tie her to the boat-builder's bed. No matter how she tries to escape, he's always there - implacable and irresistible. She knows he doesn't want a preoccupied single mother, but concealing her daughter's existence from the man she's falling in love with is getting harder and harder. If he discovers her lies, she'll instantly lose everything. Warning: contains one determined golden-skinned man who knows his way around boats, bodies and bed-sheets.	213	February 1st 2012	Rafe Severino, Sophie Calhoun		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271473-the-boat-builder-s-bed
