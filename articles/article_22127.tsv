Candide, Zadig and Selected Stories		Voltaire, Donald Murdoch Frame, John Iverson	4.11	2545	77	With Candide -a classic parody of the romantic, coming-of-age story-and the fifteen other stories in this indispensible collection, Voltaire derided the bureaucracies of his day with ruthless wit. His dissections of science, spiritual faith, legal systems, vanity, and love make him the undisputed master of social commentary.	352	January 1st 1961			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19387.Candide_Zadig_and_Selected_Stories
