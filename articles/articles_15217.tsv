Trunk Music	Harry Bosch #5	Michael Connelly	4.18	55018	1651	Back on the job after an involuntary leave of absence, LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch is ready for a challenge. But his first case is a little more than he bargained for. It starts with the body of a Hollywood producer in the trunk of a Rolls-Royce, shot twice in the head at close range - what looks like "trunk music," a Mafia hit. But the LAPD's organized crime unit is curiously uninterested, and when Harry follows a trail of gambling debts to Las Vegas, the case suddenly becomes more complex - and much more personal. A rekindled romance with an old girlfriend opens new perspectives on the murder, and he begins to glimpse a shocking triangle of corruption and collusion. Yanked off the case, Harry himself is soon the one being investigated. But only a bullet can stop Harry when he's searching for the truth . . .	448	January 28th 1997	Hieronymus "Harry" Bosch, Eleanor Wish, Roy Lindell, Kizmin "Kiz" Rider, Jerry Edgar, Irvin Irving, Grace Billets, Veronica Aliso, Ray Powers, John Chastain, Art Donovan, Luke Goshen, John Felton, Dominic Carbone, Leon Fitzgerald, Joey Marks, John Iverson, Hank Meyer, Gussie Flanagan, Gretchen Alexander	Los Angeles, California (United States), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States), California (United States), Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58962.Trunk_Music
