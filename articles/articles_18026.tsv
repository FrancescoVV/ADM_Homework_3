JESUS & THE UNABOMBER		Eric  Anderson	4.67	3	0	Jesus & The Unabomber on autism and a philosophical look at child abuse This book is about the similarities in psychology and philosophy between Jesus Christ and Ted Kaczynski and it refers to their common psychological condition as Autism Out Loud. Autism is characterized by difficulties in verbal communication, in socialization, and in mental preoccupation of a repetitive or stereotyped quality. This book is an exercise in cognition over the vagaries of cultivated-autism. Some of these vagaries are infant circumcision, formula-feeding, needle-stabbing, and fable-mongering.	21	June 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22351582-jesus-the-unabomber
