Reclaiming our intentionality: from "victims" to "creators of our destiny"		Srinivas Venkatram	4.50	2	1	All of us recognize that we should be ‘creators of our destiny’ and not ‘victims of life’. This Little Book points us to the “how”. About Illumine Little Books: Illumine Little Books are about “small-big” changes. A small-big change is one where we make a small, almost imperceptible shift in the way we think, resulting in a big, almost quantum shift in the way we respond and engage with life. Little Books require you to engage deeply for a short period of time (10-15 minutes) usually, and offer a benefit that could last a lifetime.	7	October 2nd 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32498180-reclaiming-our-intentionality
