Dragon Prow Shadow		Paul  Hodson	5.00	5	2	Monsters under the bed, everyone has them; unfortunately for Robert, his are a rowdy bunch and they keep him awake at night. With the aid of a night light and some soothing nature sounds to keep him company, a new world opens up, bringing new possibilities. When ocean waves are lapping gently against the side of his bed, he is surprised to find himself on a Viking longboat, though not quite as surprised as the Vikings. When he inadvertently helps to see off a Loki-Spawn, the Vikings claim him as their lucky charm. By now, you might be thinking is this for me, it is, it’s for everyone. It’s about someone overcoming their fears and winning the day, it’s about escaping to new adventures and facing whatever comes at you. Because sometimes, all you really need is a small person’s big imagination.	291	December 7th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37323319-dragon-prow-shadow
