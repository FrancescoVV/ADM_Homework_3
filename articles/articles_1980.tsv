By the late 23rd century the disaster that they were attempting to prevent was at hand, and there was no reversing the damage. Now two scientists, both more than a 150 years apart are brought together to find a way to change the mistakes of the past and try to save a future that can only be done through the destiny of these two individuals. The love they will find together will not only determine the fate of their own lives, but the fate of the world. Can the two of them turn back the clock and reset the future of discovery? It is a love story more than 200 years in the making that will define a destiny that will survive all time.	242	March 9th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34553023-reversione
