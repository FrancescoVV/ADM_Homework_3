The Suicide Shop		Jean Teulé, Sue Dyson	3.52	8681	1373	Has your life been a failure? Let's make your death a success With the twenty-first century just a distant memory and the world in environmental chaos, many people have lost the will to live. And business is brisk at The Suicide Shop. Run by the Tuvache family for generations, the shop offers an amazing variety of ways to end it all, with something to fit every budget. The Tuvaches go mournfully about their business, taking pride in the morbid service they provide. Until the youngest member of the family threatens to destroy their contented misery by confronting them with something they ve never encountered before: a love of life.	169	January 4th 2007	Mishima Tuvache, Lucrèce Tuvache, Marilyn Tuvache, Vincent Tuvache, Alan Tuvache, Ernest		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2796617-the-suicide-shop
