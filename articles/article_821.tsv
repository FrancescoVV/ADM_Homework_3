Dead as a Doornail	Sookie Stackhouse #5	Charlaine Harris	4.00	205478	4060	Small-town cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has had more than her share of experience with the supernatural—but now it’s really hitting close to home. When Sookie sees her brother Jason’s eyes start to change, she knows he’s about to turn into a were-panther for the first time—a transformation he embraces more readily than most shapeshifters she knows. But her concern becomes cold fear when a sniper sets his deadly sights on the local changeling population, and Jason’s new panther brethren suspect he may be the shooter. Now, Sookie has until the next full moon to find out who’s behind the attacks—unless the killer decides to find her first…	295	2005	Sookie Stackhouse, Bill Compton, Sam Merlotte, Jason Stackhouse, Eric Northman, Tara Thornton, Pam Ravenscroft, Russell Edgington, Alcide Herveaux	Bon Temps, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170210.Dead_as_a_Doornail
