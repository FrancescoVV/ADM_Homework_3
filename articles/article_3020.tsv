D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths	D'Aulaires' Greek Myths	Ingri d'Aulaire, Edgar Parin d'Aulaire	4.41	16596	1018	Here are the gods, goddesses, and legendary figures of ancient Greece--mighty Zeus, with his fistful of thunderbolts; gray-eyed Athena, goddess of wisdom; Helios, the sun; greedy King Midas--lavishly depicted by Caldecott winners Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire. In a relaxed and humorous tone, these splendid artists bring to life the myths that have inspired great European literature and art through the ages, creating a book readers of all ages will cherish. "For any child fortunate enough to have this generous book...the kings and heroes of ancient legend will remain forever matter-of-fact; the pictures interpret the text literally and are full of detail and witty observation."-- The Horn Book "The drawings, particularly the full-page ones in this oversized volume, are excellent and excitingly evocative."-- The New York Times "Parents, uncles, and aunts who have been searching for a big picture book that has good reading-aloud value for the younger ones and fine read-it-yourself value on up, have it in this volume...a children's classic."-- Christian Science Monitor	192	1962		Greece	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79626.D_Aulaires_Book_of_Greek_Myths
