Strange Angels	Strange Angels #1	Lili St. Crow, Lilith Saintcrow	3.79	39608	2178	In Strange Angels , Dru Anderson has what her grandmother called “the touch.” (Comes in handy when you’re traveling from town to town with your dad, hunting ghosts, suckers, wulfen, and the occasional zombie.) Then her dad turns up dead—but still walking—and Dru knows she’s next. Even worse, she’s got two guys hungry for her affections, and they’re not about to let the fiercely independent Dru go it alone. Will Dru discover just how special she really is before coming face-to-fang with whatever—or whoever — is hunting her?	293	May 14th 2009	Dru Anderson, Christophe Reynard, Graves	South Dakota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6006518-strange-angels
