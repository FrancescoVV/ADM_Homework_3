After days of ridicule from her peers, Val starts a school-wide campaign to rally support for her cause. She meant to make a statement, but she never dreamed the entire nation would get caught up in the controversy. As if becoming nationally recognized as “Virgin Val” isn’t enough, Val’s already hectic life starts to spin wildly out of control when bad boy Kyle Hamilton, lead singer for the hit rock band Tralse, decides to take her abstinence as a personal challenge. How can a girl stay true to herself when this year’s Sexiest Man Alive is doing everything in his power to win her over?	360	December 5th 2012	"Virgin" Val Jensen, Kyle Hamilton, Robin Daniels, Isaac Warren		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15703297-v-is-for-virgin
