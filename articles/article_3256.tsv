The Secret History of the Pink Carnation	Pink Carnation #1	Lauren Willig	3.68	21567	2201	Deciding that true romantic heroes are a thing of the past, Eloise Kelly, an intelligent American who always manages to wear her Jimmy Choo suede boots on the day it rains, leaves Harvard's Widener Library bound for England to finish her dissertation on the dashing pair of spies the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. What she discovers is something the finest historians have missed: a secret history that begins with a letter dated 1803. Eloise has found the secret history of the Pink Carnation the most elusive spy of all time, the spy who single-handedly saved England from Napoleon's invasion. The Secret History of the Pink Carnation, a wildly imaginative and highly adventurous debut, opens with the story of a modern-day heroine but soon becomes a book within a book. Eloise Kelly settles in to read the secret history hoping to unmask the Pink Carnation's identity, but before she can make this discovery, she uncovers a passionate romance within the pages of the secret history that almost threw off the course of world events. How did the Pink Carnation save England? What became of the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian? And will Eloise Kelly find a hero of her own?	428	October 10th 2004	Percy Blakeney, Miles Dorrington, Lady Henrietta Selwick, Eloise Kelly, Colin Selwick, Geoffrey Pinchingdale-Snipe, Jane Wooliston, Miss Gwen Meadows, Amy Balcourt, Lord Richard Selwick, Edouard de Balcourt, Arabella Selwick-Alderly, Lady Uppington, Lord Uppington, Serena Selwick	London, England (United Kingdom), Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84351.The_Secret_History_of_the_Pink_Carnation
