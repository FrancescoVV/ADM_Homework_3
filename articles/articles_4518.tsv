The Little Stranger		Sarah Waters	3.54	44577	6119	One postwar summer in his home of rural Warwickshire, Dr. Faraday, the son of a maid who has built a life of quiet respectability as a country physician, is called to a patient at lonely Hundreds Hall. Home to the Ayres family for over two centuries, the Georgian house, once impressive and handsome, is now in decline, its masonry crumbling, its gardens choked with weeds, the clock in its stable yard permanently fixed at twenty to nine. Its owners—mother, son, and daughter—are struggling to keep pace with a changing society, as well as with conflicts of their own. But are the Ayreses haunted by something more sinister than a dying way of life? Little does Dr. Faraday know how closely, and how terrifyingly, their story is about to become intimately entwined with his.	466	April 28th 2009	Dr. Faraday, Caroline Ayres, Roderick Ayres, Angela Ayres, Betty, Peter Baker-Hyde, Diane Baker-Hyde, Gillian Baker-Hyde, David Graham, Anne Graham, Bill Desmond, Helen Desmond, Raymond Rossifer, Morley Baker-Hyde, Maurice Babb, Jim Seeley	Warwickshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7234875-the-little-stranger
