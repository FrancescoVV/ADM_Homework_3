Collected Poems		Philip Larkin, Anthony Thwaite	4.22	8062	236	One of the best-known and best-loved poets of the English-speaking world, Philip Larkin had only a small number of his poems published during his lifetime. Collected Poems brings together not only all his books-- The North Ship , The Less Deceived , The Whitsun Weddings , and High Windows- -but also his uncollected poems from 1940 to 1984. This new edition reflects Larkin's own ordering for his poems and is the first collection to present the body of his work with the organization he preferred. Preserving everything he published in his lifetime, the new Collected Poems is an indispensable contribution to the legacy of an icon of twentieth-century poetry.	240	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111879.Collected_Poems
