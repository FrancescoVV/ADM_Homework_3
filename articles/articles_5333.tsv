The Sunflower		Richard Paul Evans	4.11	8855	1106	"Seek not your destiny, for it is seeking you." In the wake of personal tragedy, two people meet on a humanitarian mission in Peru. Christine is a shy, unadventurous woman whose fiancee broke off the engagement only a week before the wedding, and Paul is a former emergency room doctor whose glamorous lifestyle, stellar reputation, and beautiful fiancee are cruelly snatched from him one fateful, snowy Christmas Eve. Deep in the Amazon jungle, against a backdrop of poverty and heartbreak, they must confront their deepest fears and, together, learn to trust and love again.	334	October 4th 2005		Peru (Per√∫) (Peru), Amazon (Peru)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133784.The_Sunflower
