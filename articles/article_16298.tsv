Letters to Children		C.S. Lewis, Lyle Wesley Dorsett, Marjorie Lamp Mead, Douglas Gresham	4.20	1948	191	In his life, C.S. Lewis received thousands of letters from young fans who were eager for more knowledge of his bestselling Narnia books and their author. Here are collected many of his responses to those letters, in which he shares his feelings about writing, school, animals, and of course, Narnia. Lewis writes to the children - as he wrote for them - with understanding and respect, proving why he remains one of the best-loved children's authors of all time.	128	1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30626.Letters_to_Children
