A Child's Garden of Verses		Robert Louis Stevenson, Tasha Tudor	4.27	25139	643	Up into the cherry tree Who should climb but little me? I held the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad on foreign lands. Here is a delightful look at childhood, written by master poet and storyteller Robert Louis Stevenson. In this collection of sixty-six poems, Stevenson recalls the joys of his childhood, from sailing boats down a river, to waiting for the lamplighter, to sailing off to foreign lands in his imagination. Tasha Tudor's watercolour paintings evoke a simpler time in the past, and celebrate two of the things she loves most â€” children and nature. Her talents are the perfect match for these inspiring poems, making this a handsome gift edition that will be cherished by families for generations.	67	1885		Edinburgh, Scotland, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20413.A_Child_s_Garden_of_Verses
