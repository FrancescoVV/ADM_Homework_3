Oil!		Upton Sinclair	3.70	5325	626	In Oil! Upton Sinclair fashioned a novel out of the oil scandals of the Harding administration, providing in the process a detailed picture of the development of the oil industry in Southern California. Bribery of public officials, class warfare, and international rivalry over oil production are the context for Sinclair's story of a genial independent oil developer and his son, whose sympathy with the oilfield workers and socialist organizers fuels a running debate with his father. Senators, small investors, oil magnates, a Hollywood film star, and a crusading evangelist people the pages of this lively novel.	528	1926	James Arnold Ross, James Arnold "Bunny" Ross, Jr., Paul Watkins, Vernon Roscoe	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54847.Oil_
