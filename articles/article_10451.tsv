The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss		Dr. Seuss, Maurice Sendak, Audrey Geisel	4.06	10701	114	These fabulous, whimsical paintings, created for his own pleasure and never shown to the public, show Geisel (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss) in a whole new light. Depicting outlandish creatures in otherworldly settings, the paintings use a dazzling rainbow of hues not seen in the primary-color palette of his books for children, and exhibit a sophisticated and often quite unrestrained side of the artist. 65 color illustrations.	95	October 3rd 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7780.The_Secret_Art_of_Dr_Seuss
