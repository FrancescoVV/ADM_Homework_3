Tree Castle Island		Jean Craighead George	4.06	376	56	Fourteen-year-old Jack sets out in a handmade canoe for the legendary Okefenokee Swamp. But after several idyllic days of exploring, he's hit with some bad luck. He can't find his way home, and he runs into a hungry alligator who takes a bite out of his canoe. When he pulls up to a remote island, he finds another surprise: a mystery that will reach far into his own past . . . and force him to question the world he's left behind.	256	April 30th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1058582.Tree_Castle_Island
