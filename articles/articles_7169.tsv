Love That Dog	Jack #1	Sharon Creech	4.02	39469	4642	"I guess it does look like a poem when you see it typed up like that." Jack hates poetry. Only girls write it and every time he tries to, his brain feels empty. But his teacher, Ms. Stretchberry, won't stop giving her class poetry assignments -- and Jack can't avoid them. But then something amazing happens. The more he writes, the more he learns he does have something to say.	112	2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53498.Love_That_Dog
