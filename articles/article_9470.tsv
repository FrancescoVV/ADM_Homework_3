Beautiful Bitch	Beautiful Bastard #1.5	Christina Lauren	3.91	38814	1955	Picking up where Beautiful Bastard left off, Chloe Mills and Bennett Ryan continue their steamy, combative relationship. Just when Chloeâ€™s career starts to take off, Bennett wishes it would all slow down long enough to spend a wild night alone with his girlfriend. But after he refuses to take no for an answer, Chloe and Bennett find themselves with two plane tickets, one French Villa, and a surprising conversation that, predictably, leaves them wrestling under the covers.	160	July 9th 2013	Chloe Mills, Bennett Ryan	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Marseille (Marseilles) (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17831616-beautiful-bitch
