Anna possesses an extraordinary empathy that draws to her a marvelous collection of lovelorn souls, who form a mischievous chorus in the novel and play matchmaker between Anna and a lonely widower. Their meddling takes Anna's life in a direction she could never have imagined, one filled with magic and uncertainty. While Anna is rediscovering passion, Mariela is encountering it for the first time. Anna wishes to protect Mariela from all worldy disapointments, but she cannot. The cadence of their daily lives is interrupted by loss, ungovernable and haunting, as Anna finds herself torn between the man who wants her badly and the daughter who needs her more.
