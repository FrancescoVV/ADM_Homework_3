Family Secrets: Secrets of the Night, #1		Rebekah McClew	4.82	11	0	While Laila found herself blending in with the town, my obsession led me to the McAllister estate. Despite the warnings I was told about the estate my curiosity grew and I became obsessed with the home as well as the inhabitants inside. In the end it took two idiots to bite me and one to dig me up. I had no idea what was going to happen to me from this point on but I did know there wasn't a choice; it was inevitably going to happen.	285	December 15th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16200303-family-secrets
