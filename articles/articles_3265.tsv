Goblinheart		Brett Axel, Terra Bidlespacher	4.45	173	35	Using "fairy" and "goblin" in lieu of female and male, the author has created a timely allegorical fairy tale. A youngster named Julep, who lives in a forest tribe, insists on growing up to be a goblin rather than a fairy. The tribe learns to accept that Julep is a goblin at heart, eventually coming around to support the physical transition that must be made for Julep to live as a goblin.	40	April 28th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13602221-goblinheart
