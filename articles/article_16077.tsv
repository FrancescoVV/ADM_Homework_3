Russian Roulette: The Story of an Assassin	Alex Rider #10	Anthony Horowitz	4.34	7523	656	Alex Rider is actually the end of the story. Yassen Gregorovich was the beginning. Alex Rider’s life changed forever with one bullet and the pull of a trigger. Alex Rider’s life changed forever with the silent pull of a trigger. When Ian Rider died at the hands of the assassin Yassen Gregorovich, Alex, ready or not, was thrust into the world of international espionage—the world’s only teenage spy. Alex vowed revenge against Yassen and the two have battled ever since. Yet, years ago, it was none other than Alex’s own father who trained and mentored Yassen, turning him into the killer he would eventually become. What makes us choose evil? Why did one boy choose to kill while another chose to risk his life to save others? In some ways, Alex Rider and Yassen Gregorovich are mirror images of each other. Yet the paths they traveled turned them into mortal enemies. This is Yassen’s story. A journey down a darkened path.	405	October 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465455-russian-roulette
