What I Saw and How I Lied		Judy Blundell	3.52	13565	2038	When Evie's father returned home from World War II, the family fell back into its normal life pretty quickly. But Joe Spooner brought more back with him than just good war stories. When movie-star handsome Peter Coleridge, a young ex-GI who served in Joe's company in postwar Austria, shows up, Evie is suddenly caught in a complicated web of lies that she only slowly recognizes. She finds herself falling for Peter, ignoring the secrets that surround him . . . until a tragedy occurs that shatters her family and breaks her life in two.	284	November 1st 2008	Evie Spooner, Peter Coleridge, Joe Spooner	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4052117-what-i-saw-and-how-i-lied
