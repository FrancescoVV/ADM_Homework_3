When the ethical rules guiding your life need to be broken in order to have her. When you've eloped to avoid the stigma of an inter-racial marriage among Alabama's elite. If you're Odell Moore, one of New York’s most successful lawyers, the entire world is watching your inevitable descent. And two New York detectives will be waiting to greet you in hell. Love, jealousy, and deceit lead to murder in a penthouse apartment. But did Odell do it? Even he can’t be sure. Othello has re-emerged in modern Manhattan. Will it end better for him and Desdemona this time? Follow the clues and beware the plot twists and turns to the very last page in Norman Bacal's debut novel.	352	October 2nd 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53101971-odell-s-fall
