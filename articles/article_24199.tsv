Weinberg	3.58	113	4	The fabled Well of the furies holds the power to transform ordinary men and women into heroes-and villains--mighty enough to rival the demigods of Greek myth.

The two men will become legends--one a champion of justice known as Statesman, the other a reclusive criminal mastermind whose diabolical schemes will shake the globe. Their epic conflict begins in Paragon City, a once-great American metropolis brought low by the depression and crippled by corruption. but the battle cannot be won by Statesman alone. For justice to triumph, Paragon will have to become a city of Heroes.	377	October 17th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/918725.The_Web_of_Arachnos
