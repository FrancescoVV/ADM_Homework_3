The Outlaw Demon Wails	The Hollows #6	Kim Harrison	4.37	54043	1278	Note: This book is the same as The Outlaw Demon Wails. It was printed under both titles. To save the lives of her friends, Rachel did the unthinkable: she willingly trafficked in forbidden demon magic. And now her sins are coming home to haunt her. As Rachel searches for the truth behind a terrifying murder, an even greater menace threatens, for the demon Algaliarept will stop at nothing to claim her, and the discovery of a shocking family secret throws Rachel's entire life into question. If she is ever to live free, Rachel must first walk willingly into the demonic ever-after in search of long-lost ancient knowledge. But when you dance with demons, you lay your soul on the line . . . and there are some lines that should never be crossed.	455	February 26th 2008	Rachel Morgan, Ivy Tamwood, Jenks, Trent Kalamack, Algaliarept, Marshal, David Hue, Detective Glenn, Ceri, Newt, Rynn Cormel, Tom Bansen, Minias, Jonathan, Quen, Bis	Cincinnati, Ohio (United States), Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1225621.The_Outlaw_Demon_Wails
