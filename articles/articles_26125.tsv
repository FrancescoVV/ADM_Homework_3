Blood Oath	Nathaniel Cade #1	Christopher Farnsworth	3.93	7903	1086	Zach Barrows is an ambitious young White House staffer whose career takes an unexpected turn when he's partnered with Nathaniel Cade, a secret agent sworn to protect the President. But Cade is no ordinary civil servant. Bound by a special blood oath, he is a vampire. Cade battles nightmares before they can break into the daylight world of the American dream, enemies far stranger-and far more dangerous-than civilians have ever imagined. Blood Oath is the first in a series of novels featuring Nathaniel Cade-the President's vampire.	390	May 18th 2010	Nathaniel Cade, Zach Barrows	Washington, D.C.
