Zigzag Street		Nick Earls	3.89	1115	62	Richard Derrington's doing it tough. Since Anna trashed him his job seems pointles, Tuesday seems moderately fucked by ten, his tennis appalling.....long periods of complete crap, punctuated by flashes of very random glory and the future bleka. This is a hiatus? There I was thinking I was sinking and it's just a hiatus. Apart from his friens, the only thing keeping Richard going is his wicked sense of humour. Then things look up.	288	1996		Queensland (Australia), Brisbane, Queensland (Australia), Australia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/648165.Zigzag_Street
