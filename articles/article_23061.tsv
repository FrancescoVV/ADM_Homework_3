The Grace of a Duke	The Daughters of the Aristocracy #2	Linda Rae Sande	3.91	206	16	They say time heals all wounds ... but what of those left by love? Having barely survived the fire that killed his family, Joshua Wainwright reluctantly begins his reign as the new Duke of Chichester. He is still recovering from his burns when he returns to Wisborough Oaks, the family seat in Sussex where the fire occurred. With reconstruction underway and a backlog of estate business to complete, the very last thing Joshua can handle is the sudden appearance of Lady Charlotte, the daughter of the Earl of Ellsworth. Once betrothed to Joshua's older brother, Charlotte has spent her entire life training to be the Duchess of Chichester. Now that the man she was supposed to marry is dead, Charlotte is determined to marry Joshua, for despite the horrific scars that require him to wear a mask over one side of his face, she has secretly loved him since her coming-out. Never mind that her father has arranged a betrothal to the Earl of Gisborn! The duke has no idea it was Charlotte who arranged for his medical care and transport to London after the fire. Given his scars and the gossip mongers in London who refer to him as "His Grace with half a face", he's determined to spare Charlotte from having to marry him, even if she feels duty-bound to do so. But Charlotte, hiding a hideous scar of her own, will do whatever it takes, including seduction, to secure a marriage to the man she loves. Will Joshua's apparent indifference send her into the arms of the earl who has come to claim her? Or will Charlotte choose a different path? Love proves it can heal even the deepest wounds in The Grace of a Duke .	348	April 20th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17855850-the-grace-of-a-duke
