The First Lie	The Lying Game #0.5	Sara Shepard	3.84	2554	201	Featuring Sutton Mercer before her tragic death, this stand-alone digital original novella from #1 New York Times bestselling author Sara Shepard is an exciting, must-read companion to the Lying Game series. Back when she was alive, Sutton kept a million secrets. But how she got together with Thayer is her juiciest one of all. . . . It's the summer before junior year and Sutton Mercer and her friends rule Hollier High. Then Thayer Vega returns home from soccer camp. In two short months he's gone from being her best friend's scrawny younger brother to a hot soccer god with a major egoâ€”and a bone to pick with the Lying Game girls. To bring him back down to earth, Sutton's friends convince her to string Thayer along so she can publicly reject him. But as she gets to know the real Thayer, Sutton starts to wonder: Is flirting with Thayer still just a game to her? Or is the queen of the Lying Game lying . . . to herself?	80	December 18th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16072107-the-first-lie
