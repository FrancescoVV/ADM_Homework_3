The Renfield Syndrome	Rhiannon's Law #2	J.A. Saare	4.04	3198	299	Vampires, and werewolves, and demons, oh my. Rhiannon thought facing off against a deranged child vampire was the most dangerous task she would ever have to undertake, but she’s about to discover making a deal with a demon is far, far worse. Sent forward into another reality, one in which vampires are now dominating nearly extinct humans, she realizes the sooner she returns to her vampire lover, Disco, the better. Unfortunately, time changes a lot of things; including those most trusted around her. When she’s faced with a loss and betrayal unlike any she has ever known, her focus shifts from severing the debt between the demon that wants to kill her, to exacting a revenge that will bring forth consequences she never could have fathomed. By reaching out to the darkness lingering within her, she’ll find the strength to push forward despite the circumstances that would see her dead and buried. After all, when it’s all said and done, all that she has left to lose is her soul.	212	August 1st 2011	Rhiannon Murphy, Disco		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8513841-the-renfield-syndrome
