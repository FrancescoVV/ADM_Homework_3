Payne, twin sister of Vishous, is cut from the same dark, seductive cloth as her brother.

Manuel Manello, M.D., is drafted by the Brotherhood to save her as only he can - but when the human surgeon and the vampire warrior meet, their two worlds collide in the face of their undeniable passion. With so much working against them, can love prove stronger than the birthright and the biology that separates them? 18 hours and 37 minutes.	512	March 1st 2011	Butch Brian O'Neal, Vishous (Black Dagger), Jane Whitcomb, Manuel "Manny" Manello, Payne, Qhuinn, Blaylock, Xcor, Throe, The Scribe Virgin, Wrath (Blind King)	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8492319-lover-unleashed
