A Prayer for Owen Meany		John Irving	4.23	286530	13852	Eleven-year-old Owen Meany, playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire, hits a foul ball and kills his best friend's mother. Owen doesn't believe in accidents; he believes he is God's instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul is both extraordinary and terrifying. At moments a comic, self-deluded victim, but in the end the principal, tragic actor in a divine plan, Owen Meany is the most heartbreaking hero John Irving has yet created.	637	March 28th 1989	Owen Meany, John Wheelwright	Gravesend, New Hampshire (United States), Toronto, Ontario (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4473.A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany
