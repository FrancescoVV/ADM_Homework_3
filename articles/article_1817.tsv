Written on the Body		Jeanette Winterson	4.07	24369	1710	Written on the Body is a secret code only visible in certain lights: the accumulation of a lifetime gather there. In places the palimpsest is so heavily worked that the letters feel like braille. I like to keep my body rolled away from prying eyes, never unfold too much, tell the whole story. I didn't know that Louise would have reading hands. She has translated me into her own book.	192	1992		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15054.Written_on_the_Body
