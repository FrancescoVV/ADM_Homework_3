Drifters Volume 1	Drifters #1	Kohta Hirano	3.81	458	48	First he pitted the Catholic church against vampires, Nazis and Great Britain, bathing London in a flood of blood. But Hellsing creator Kohta Hirano still had something crazy up his sleeve when he created his new series, Drifters. Imagine a world of magic, full of elves and hobbits and dragons and orcs. Inside this world of magic and wonder there is a great war being waged, using warriors from human history as chess pieces in a bloody, endless battle. Hirano's new concept gathers famous warriors throughout history and puts them on both sides of good and evil â€” and then turns them loose in a bloody melee of madness!	216	July 7th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11080437-drifters-volume-1
