Cherry Pie	Vampire Cherry #3	Sotia Lazu	4.57	7	5	If Constantine is to be believed—which Alex insists he isn’t—Cherry can become human again. According to her ex, the prophecy that holds the cure calls for certain things she may not be ready for, though, and his suggestion for getting over a pesky clause complicates things further. But Cherry won’t be dissuaded. She has lost her career, her life, and both the men she’s loved, because others made her choices for her. It’s time for that to stop.	99	October 31st 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32204919-cherry-pie
