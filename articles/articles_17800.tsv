Dying to Know You		Aidan Chambers	3.56	2260	394	Karl, aged seventeen, is hopelessly in love. But the object of his affections, Fiorella, demands proof, and poses him a series of questions regarding his attitude to the many sides of love. But Karl is dyslexic, and convinced that if Fiorella finds out, she will think he is stupid, and unworthy of her, and leave him. So Karl asks a local writer to help him construct his replies - and an unlikely, but extremely touching, friendship develops between the two men. They both come to learn a great deal about about life from a very different perspective, and when an act of violence shatters their calm, they find their respective appraisal of life shifting in profound ways. This is Aidan Chambers' Dying to Know You.	288	2012	Author, Karl, Fiorella		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12750296-dying-to-know-you
