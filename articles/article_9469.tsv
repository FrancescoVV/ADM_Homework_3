Gone Tomorrow	Jack Reacher #13	Lee Child	4.17	89635	3132	Suicide bombers are easy to spot. They give out all kinds of tell-tale signs. Mostly because they're nervous. By definition they're all first-timers. There are twelve things to look for: No one who has worked in law enforcement will ever forget them. New York City. The subway, two o'clock in the morning. Jack Reacher studies his fellow passengers. Four are OK. The fifth isn't. The train brakes for Grand Central Station. Will Reacher intervene, and save lives? Or is he wrong? Will his intervention cost lives - including his own?	441	April 2009	Jacob "Jake" Mark, Susan Mark, Theresa Lee, John Sansom, Jack Reacher	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4494917-gone-tomorrow
