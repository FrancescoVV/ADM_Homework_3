Scandal		Shūsaku Endō, Van C. Gessel	3.68	975	112	Involves a famous Catholic writer whose comfortable life is shattered when a drunken woman crashes a reception in his honor, claiming that he frequents the red-light district of Tokyo and that his portrait is exhibited in a gallery there. The result: his reputation as a writer, his marriage, and his sense of identity all are placed at risk. A psychological thriller and a literary work of art which, as it subtly peels off layers of the dark side of human nature, grips and propels the reader.	261	1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25207.Scandal
