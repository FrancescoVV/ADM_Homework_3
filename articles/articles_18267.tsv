Georgia Pine	The Vast Landscape #2	Jacqueline Cioffa	4.27	22	3	THE VAST LANDSCAPE continues, alive in memory. The gatekeeper, fixer of Harrison’s family, Georgia Pine. Faint whispers drift from the stars into the evergreen, cottage bedroom. The Cove, a mystic beach, granddaughter’s refuge. The sea, sun, stars and moon welcome their return. The crimson child, with blazing hair and fire belly will do as she’s told, not before she’s ready. Pyre and brimstone, locks of ginger, gut instinct to guide her. Fans of the emotional, soul stirring first novel will not be able to put this exciting sequel down.	246	January 30th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25244975-georgia-pine
