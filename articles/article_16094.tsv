The Reality Dysfunction 1: Emergence	Night's Dawn #1, Part 1 of 2	Peter F. Hamilton	4.26	6522	113	In the far future, humanity has divided into two diametrically opposed groups. The Edenists are genetically engineered space-dwellers with telepathic affinity for their biotechnological homes and ships. The Adamists, effectively the Luddites of the future, are willing to pioneer new worlds, much as their ancestors did hundreds of years ago. The two groups, peopled by fascinating characters, clash on a primitive world called Lalonde, setting in motion a tale of adventure unparalleled in this universe.	592	July 1st 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/761154.The_Reality_Dysfunction_1
