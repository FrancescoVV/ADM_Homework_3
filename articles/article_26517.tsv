The Seven Whispers: Listening to the Voice of Spirit		Christina Baldwin	4.17	137	16	Christina Baldwin gives us a personal guide for listening to the inner voice within each of us. The book is built around seven phrases, or whispers, she has discovered, which form the basis of each chapter: maintain peace of mind; move at the pace of guidance; practise certainty of purpose; surrender to surprises; ask for what you need and offer what you can; love the people around you; give something back to the world.	128	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217293.The_Seven_Whispers
