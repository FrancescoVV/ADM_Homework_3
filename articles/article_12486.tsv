Eggs		Jerry Spinelli	3.61	9797	1192	Nine-year-old David has recently lost his mother to a freak accident, his salesman father is constantly on the road, and he is letting his anger out on his grandmother. Sarcastic and bossy 13-year-old Primrose lives with her childlike, fortuneteller mother, and a framed picture is the only evidence of the father she never knew. Despite their differences, David and Primrose forge a tight yet tumultuous friendship, eventually helping each other deal with what is missing in their lives. This powerful, quirky novel about two very complicated, damaged children has much to say about friendship, loss, and recovery.	224	January 1st 2007	David Limpert, Primrose Dufee, Madamme Dufee, Margaret Limpert, "Refrigerator" John Daywalt	Perkiomen Township, Pennsylvania	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169413.Eggs
