Joker	Batman	Brian Azzarello, Lee Bermejo	4.04	30060	1189	An original hardcover graphic novel that tells the story of one very dark night in Gotham City--from the creative team behind the graphic novel LEX LUTHOR: MAN OF STEEL. The Joker has been mysteriously released from Arkham Asylum, and he's none to happy about what's happened to his Gotham City rackets while he's been "away." What follows is a harrowing night of revenge, murder and manic crime as only The Joker can deliver it, as he brutally takes back his stolen assets from The Penguin, The Riddler, Two-Face, Killer Croc and others. Brian Azzarello brings to THE JOKER all the visceral intensity and criminal insight that has made his Vertigo graphic novel series 100 BULLETS one of the most critically-acclaimed and award-winning series in all of comics.	128	November 4th 2008	Harvey Dent, Harley Quinn, Waylon Jones, Oswald Cobblepot, Bruce Wayne, Joker		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3134981-joker
