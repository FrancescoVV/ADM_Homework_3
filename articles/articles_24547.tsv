Wicked War of Mine	Overworld Chronicles #9	John Corwin	4.28	558	12	TIME FOR PAYBACK Daelissa's attack on Queens Gate dealt Justin and the resistance a serious blow. The loss of his home and one of their strongest allies seems to mean certain defeat. Justin isn't about to give up. He embarks on a mission to bring the houses of Daemos to his side and seeks help from Fjoeruss, Mr. Gray himself, even if the odds of success are slim. As if the pressure isn't already high enough, Justin discovers something even more troubling. Daelissa is already in Seraphina. One silver lining remains: Justin might be able to end the war in one blow if his forces can disable the Grand Nexus before she returns with a Seraphim army. If the good guys can't shut down the Grand Nexus in time, Daelissa will unleash a can of whoop-ass on Eden the likes of which has never been seen.
