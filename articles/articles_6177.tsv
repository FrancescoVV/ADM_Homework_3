Drown		Junot DÃ­az	4.03	32140	2442	With ten stories that move from the barrios of the Dominican Republic to the struggling urban communities of New Jersey, Junot Diaz makes his remarkable debut. Diaz's work is unflinching and strong, and these stories crackle with an electric sense of discovery. Diaz evokes a world in which fathers are gone, mothers fight with grim determination for their families and themselves, and the next generation inherits the casual cruelty, devastating ambivalence, and knowing humor of lives circumscribed by poverty and uncertainty. In Drown , Diaz has harnessed the rhythms of anger and release, frustration and joy, to indelible effect.	208	December 25th 1995	Yunior de Las Casas	Dominican Republic, New Jersey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531989.Drown
