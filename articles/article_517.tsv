Johnny Got His Gun		Dalton Trumbo	4.18	34422	2272	This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safe for democracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else mattered - not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives... This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome... but so is war. Winner of the National Book Award.	309	1939	Joe Bonham		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51606.Johnny_Got_His_Gun
