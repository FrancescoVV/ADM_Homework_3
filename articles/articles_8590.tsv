A kiss doesn’t mean eternity . . . Valerie Moyer doesn’t believe in vampires—until she is kidnapped by a fanged psychopath! After escaping her bloodthirsty captor, she’s through with creatures of the night. Until she finds herself under the protection of the darkly handsome Anders. Not only is she expected to accept that Anders is immortal, but also that she is the woman destined to be his life mate! . . . Or does it? Anders felt a connection to Valerie from the moment he cradled her bruised body in his arms. But before he claims her, he must destroy the vampire who almost stole her from him forever. His job would be easier if Valerie didn’t fight him every step of the way. Still, Anders loves a challenge, and the green-eyed beauty is worth fighting for!	358	February 26th 2013	Valerie Moyer, Semen "Anders" Andronnikov	Cambridge, Ontario (Canada), Toronto, Ontario (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15722934-immortal-ever-after
