Emotional First Aid: Healing Rejection, Guilt, Failure, and Other Everyday Hurts		Guy Winch	4.01	2147	200	Heal small emotional injuries before they become big ones. We all sustain emotional wounds. Failure, guilt, rejection, and loss are as much a part of life as the occasional scraped elbow. But while we typically bandage a cut or ice a sprained ankle, our first aid kit for emotional injuries is not just understocked—it’s nonexistent. Fortunately, there is such a thing as mental first aid for battered emotions. Drawing on the latest scientific research and using real-life examples, practicing psychologist Guy Winch, Ph.D. offers specific step-by-step treatments that are fast, simple, and effective. Prescriptive and unique, Emotional First Aid is essential reading for anyone looking to become more resilient, build self-esteem, and let go of the hurts and hang-ups that are holding them back.	304	July 20th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158512-emotional-first-aid
