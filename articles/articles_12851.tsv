Without a Trace	Rock Harbor #1	Colleen Coble	4.12	6967	499	A plane crash claimed the lives of her husband and son, but Bree Nichols and Samson, her search and rescue dog, won't rest until they've recovered the lost bodies-or combed every inch of the wilderness trying. Meanwhile, the quiet town of Rock Harbor is disturbed by a violent crime. Bree soon discovers a personal stake in the solving of the murder, and in the course of her investigation, discovers links to her husband's plane crash. Could solving the crime bring her peace with her own loss? Or, more incredibly, reunite her family?	289	2003		Michigan (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15869688-without-a-trace
