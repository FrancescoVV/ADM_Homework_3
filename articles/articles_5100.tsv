Half Wild	The Half Bad Trilogy #2	Sally Green	4.01	17807	2624	"You will have a powerful Gift, but itâ€™s how you use it that will show you to be good or bad." In a modern-day England where two warring factions of witches live amongst humans, seventeen-year-old Nathan is an abomination, the illegitimate son of the world's most powerful and violent witch. Nathan is hunted from all sides: nowhere is safe and no one can be trusted. Now, Nathan has come into his own unique magical Gift, and he's on the run--but the Hunters are close behind, and they will stop at nothing until they have captured Nathan and destroyed his father.	412	March 24th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20814989-half-wild
