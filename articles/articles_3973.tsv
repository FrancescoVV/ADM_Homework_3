The Undomestic Goddess		Sophie Kinsella	3.84	259336	8307	Workaholic attorney Samantha Sweeting has just done the unthinkable. She’s made a mistake so huge, it’ll wreck any chance of a partnership. Going into utter meltdown, she walks out of her London office, gets on a train, and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Asking for directions at a big, beautiful house, she’s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea they’ve hired a lawyer–and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She can’t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the #@%# ironing board to open. How she takes a deep breath and begins to cope–and finds love–is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake. But will her old life ever catch up with her? And if it does…will she want it back?	404	July 19th 2005	Nathaniel, Melissa Blake, Samantha Sweeting, Maya, John Ketterman, Arnold Saville, Maggie Neely, Guy Ashby, Clive Sutherland, Daniel Sweeting, Ms. Tennyson, Freya, Mrs. Farley, Charles Conway, Trish Geiger, Eddie Geiger, Iris (divers), Annabel, Eamonn, Lara, Melanie Stryder, Jan Martin, Hilary, Dominic Kitchen	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33722.The_Undomestic_Goddess
