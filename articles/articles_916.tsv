Vampires rule the darkness in a predator-eat-predator world rife with dangers beyond imagining - and it's Rachel Morgan's job to keep that world civilized. A bounty hunter and witch with serious sex appeal and an attitude, she'll bring 'em back alive, dead... or undead.	416	April 1st 2004	Rachel Morgan, Ivy Tamwood, Jenks, Trent Kalamack, Algaliarept, Kisten Felps, Nick Sparagmos, Detective Glenn, Jonathan, Captain Edden	Cincinnati, Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30264.Dead_Witch_Walking
