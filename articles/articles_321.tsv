The Monster at the End of this Book	Big Little Golden Books	Jon Stone, Michael J. Smollin	4.44	120338	2977	Many adults name this book as their favorite Little Golden Book. Generations of kids have interacted with lovable, furry old Grover as he begs the reader not to turn the page—for fear of a monster at the end of the book. “Oh, I am so embarrassed,” he says on the last page . . . for, of course, the monster is Grover himself! This all-time favorite is now available as a Big Little Golden Book—perfect for lap-time reading.	32	1971	Grover		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44186.The_Monster_at_the_End_of_this_Book
