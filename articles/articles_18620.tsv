An Inkling Hope: Select Poems		Erin A. Thomas, Daniel Barth	3.87	30	3	Drawn from material written over a span of 12 years, this collection has been a labor of love. 128 form and free verse poems dance together through a variety of topics, themes and styles. Each poem has been selected for its strong visual presentation, an element of timelessness and one or more of the following: potent metaphor or allegory, intricate yet tastefully evasive abstraction, a concrete storylineâ€”real or imagined.	210	March 9th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622600-an-inkling-hope
