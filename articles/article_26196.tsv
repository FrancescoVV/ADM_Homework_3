Underdead	Underdead Mystery #1	Liz Jasper	3.55	370	42	Newbie science teacher Jo Gartner thinks her life has reached an all time low when she realizes the biggest excitement of her year is the staff Christmas party. Then she gets bitten by a vampire. Sort of. And then she’s a murder suspect. The police are at her door, the Undead are at her windows, and her vampire traits are growing harder to hide by the minute. If she doesn’t figure out who to trust she won’t be alive long enough to worry about all those papers she still has to grade.	276	2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2788968-underdead
