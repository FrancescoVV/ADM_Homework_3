Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for... When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.	661	June 1965	Stilgar, Vladimir Harkonnen, Duncan Idaho, Leto Atreides, Paul Atreides, Alia Atreides, Lady Jessica, Shaddam IV, Gurney Halleck	Arrakis, Caladan, Giedi Prime, Harko Arrakin Sietch Tabr, Harko, Arrakin, Sietch Tabr	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune
