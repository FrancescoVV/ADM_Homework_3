A Handful of Dust		Evelyn Waugh	3.91	23029	1240	Laced with cynicism and truth, "A Handful of Dust" satirizes a certain stratum of English life where all the characters have wealth, but lack practically every other credential. Murderously urbane, it depicts the breakup of a marriage in the London gentry, where the errant wife suffers from terminal boredom, and becomes enamoured of a social parasite and professional luncheon-goer.	308	1934	Tony Last, Brenda Last, John Beaver	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531262.A_Handful_of_Dust
