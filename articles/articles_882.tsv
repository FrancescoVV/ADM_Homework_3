Every Day	Every Day #1	David Levithan	3.94	196611	20655	Every day a different body. Every day a different life. Every day in love with the same girl. There’s never any warning about where it will be or who it will be. A has made peace with that, even established guidelines by which to live: Never get too attached. Avoid being noticed. Do not interfere. It’s all fine until the morning that A wakes up in the body of Justin and meets Justin’s girlfriend, Rhiannon. From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone A wants to be with—day in, day out, day after day.	322	August 28th 2012	A, Nathan Daldry, Justin (Every Day), Anderson Poole, Rhiannon (Every Day)	Maryland (United States), United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13262783-every-day
