Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	Harry Potter #2	J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré	4.43	2743203	53175	Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys had been so mean and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he’s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And strike it does. For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girls’ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins – someone is turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possible be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects… Harry Potter himself!	341	July 2nd 1998	Draco Malfoy, Ron Weasley, Petunia Dursley, Vernon Dursley, Dudley Dursley, Severus Snape, Rubeus Hagrid, Lord Voldemort, Minerva McGonagall, Neville Longbottom, Fred Weasley, George Weasley, Percy Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Colin Creevey, Filius Flitwick, Gilderoy Lockhart, Lucius Malfoy, Pomona Sprout, Arthur Weasley, Molly Weasley, Cornelius Fudge, Poppy Pomfrey, Oliver Wood, Dobby, Parvati Patil, Dean Thomas, James Potter, Seamus Finnigan, Rolanda Hooch, Katie Bell, Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger	Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (United Kingdom), Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , 1993 (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15881.Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets
