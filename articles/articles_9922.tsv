Artemis		Andy Weir	3.66	175829	20257	Jazz Bashara is a criminal. Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itselfâ€”and that now, her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.	305	November 14th 2017	Jasmine "Jazz" Bashara, Trond Landvik, Ammar Bashara, Bob Lewis, Dale Shapiro, Kelvin Otieno, Rudy DuBois, Martin Svoboda, Jin Chu, Fidelis Ngugi	Moon	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis
