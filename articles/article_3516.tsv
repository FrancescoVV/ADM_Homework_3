Danse Macabre	Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #14	Laurell K. Hamilton	3.82	43976	920	ACE #1 These days, Anita Blake is less interested in vampire politics than in an ancient, ordinary dread she shares with women down the ages: she may be pregnant. And, if she is, whether the father is a vampire, a werewolf, or someone else entirely, he knows perfectly well that being a Federal Marshal known for raising the dead and being a vampire executioner, is no way to bring up a baby.	517	2006	Anita Blake, Jean-Claude (Anita Blake series), Richard Zeeman, Asher (Anita Blake series), Requiem, Jason Schuyler, Nathaniel Graison, Damian (Anita Blake series), Micah Callahan, Marmee Noir, Belle Morte, Wicked Truth, Graham, London, Augustine, Claudia		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121927.Danse_Macabre
