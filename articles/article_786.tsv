Forrest Gump	Forrest Gump #1	Winston Groom	4.06	59932	2415	At 6'6" and 240lbs, Forrest Gump is difficult to ignore. This satire follows him from the football dynasties of Bear Bryant to Vietnam, and from encounters with Presidents Johnson and Nixon to pow-wows with Chairman Mao. It also takes in Harvard University, a Hollywood set, and a NASA mission. "Forrest Gump is line bred out of Voltaire and Huck Finn; its humour is wild and coarse, a satire right on the money. It is not the less honest for being so funny, for bringing the woebegone archangels of our culture and history to judgement. Anyone who doesn't read this book deserves to spend the winter in North Dakota" (Jim Harrison) "A superbly controlled satire" (The Washington Post) "Rollicking, bawdy... A good time... Poking fun at everything" (People) "Winston Groom has created the ideal citizen for the modern world - a perfect idiot" (P.J. O'Rourke) "Joyously madcap" (Publishers Weekly)	248	December 31st 1986	Forrest Gump, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest Gump Jnr, Jenny Curran	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186190.Forrest_Gump
