INFALLIBLE (BOOK 2) THE COMMITMENT FAILURE		T.J. Spencer Jacques	4.30	10	1	What made him lie to you? What caused him to notice her? What made him emotionally attached to her? The men in this novel are fictitious, but their behaviors and mannerisms are as tangible as the skin on your lips. Infallible is Infidelity from the perspective of men who perfected the art of grooming an additional lover, and their self-justification for her existence. Their names are embellished, but you know them, you've dated one of them: you didn't realize it until it was too late. These five adulterers will expound on the age-old question better than any magazine article or chat with a girlfriend over a pint of gelato. What makes a man cheat? Welcome to Infallible: VOL 2; where our cast of characters are faced with a life-changing decision to end their secondary relationships or continue as Man Whores. VOL 1 ended with a financial incentive from Uncle Glenn; VOL 2 picks up with the stipulation that they must dissolve the relationship with their mistresses within 72 hours. Can they do it? Will they do it? If you desire the truth about adultery in a glittered box tied with a pink ribbon, then INFALLIBLE is not for you. This novel is unapologetically raw and abrasive, because the discovery of an affair is equally raw and abrasive. Author TJ Spencer Jacques has gift-wrapped the ugly truth from a perspective that was never intended for female consumption. INFALLIBLE: VOL 2 is the whole truth conveniently packaged to provide insight and educate would-be victims. Welcome to Infallible - enter at the risk of your innocence.	235	August 13th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45160773-infallible-book-2-the-commitment-failure
