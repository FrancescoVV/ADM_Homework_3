Although the poverty and betrayals of Mao's regime have drained him, Xu Sanguan ultimately finds strength in the blood ties of his family. With rare emotional intensity, grippingly raw descriptions of place and time, and clear-eyed compassion, Yu Hua gives us a stunning tapestry of human life in the grave particulars of one man's days.	263	1995	Xu Sanguan, Xu Yulan, Xu Yile, Xu Erle, Xu Sanle		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334970.Chronicle_of_a_Blood_Merchant
