From Dead to Worse	Sookie Stackhouse #8	Charlaine Harris	4.01	175217	3744	After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing. It's clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not. And Sookie, Friend to the Pack and blood-bonded to Eric Northman, leader of the local vampire community is caught up in the changes. In the ensuing battles, Sookie faces danger, death, and once more, betrayal by someone she loves. And when the fur has finished flying and the cold blood finished flowing, her world will be forever altered.	359	May 2008	Sookie Stackhouse, Bill Compton, Sam Merlotte, Jason Stackhouse, Eric Northman, Tara Thornton, Pam Ravenscroft, Sophie-Anne LeClerq, Alcide Herveaux, Claudine Crane, Amelia Broadway, Octavia Fant, Francine Quinn, Claude Crane, Niall Brigant, Bob Jessup, John Quinn	Bon Temps, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2233407.From_Dead_to_Worse
