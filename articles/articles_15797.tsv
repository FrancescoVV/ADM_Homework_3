The Reaping	The Fahllen #1	Michelle Leighton	3.75	1243	97	Every hell has its devil. And Carson is about to become intimately acquainted with hers. Seventeen-year-old wallflower Carson Porter has always dreamed of being something special, but what she gets isn’t what she signed up for. Yeah, a girl’s supposed to change as she gets older, but this is ridiculous! Shiny skin, greener eyes and a run-in with the flesh-eating dead are just a few of the changes Carson has to adjust to, not to mention the arrival of very hot and very dangerous Derek Hrolf. If all that wasn’t enough to turn her once hum-drum life into something unrecognizable, a twin sister that haunts her from the shadows and a wheeling, dealing collector of souls will definitely do the trick. The question is: what will her life become? And what will she become?	258	January 28th 2011	Carson Porter, Derek Hrolf		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10354373-the-reaping
