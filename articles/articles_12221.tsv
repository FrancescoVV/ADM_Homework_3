Kill For Me	Romantic Suspense #9	Karen      Rose	4.25	7489	330	New York Times bestselling author Karen Rose delivers another pulse-pounding suspense novel that ties into SCREAM FOR ME. Five teenage girls have been murdered. One survived, and only she can reveal the secrets of a disturbing ring of people who kidnap and sell teenage girls on the black market. But those responsible for the crimes will do whatever it takes to maintain her silence. Susannah Vartanian and Luke Papadopoulos have both sworn to stop the murderers for their own reasons. Susannah, the sister of the hero in SCREAM FOR ME, suffers from a mysterious past that is connected to the sinister black market. Luke is an investigative agent and a computer expert who refuses to let another child predator get away. Susannah and Luke are instantly attracted to each other, but their troubled pasts prevent them from immediately acting upon their feelings. The case will lead them to the shady realm of Internet chat rooms, where anyone can mask their identity. As Susannah and Luke draw closer to the criminals, they discover a chain of deception so intricate they don't know who to trust. Susannah and Luke find comfort in one another's arms, but the killers are ruthless and determined, and will take extreme measures to insure their anonymity and keep their business intact.	415	February 2nd 2009	Special Agent Steven Thatcher, Susannah Vartanian, Special Agent Luke Papadopoulos GBI, Special Agent Daniel Vartanian GBI, Dr Felicity Berg, Bailey Crighton, Hope Crighton, Chase Wharton, Special Agent Talia Scott, Meredith Fallon	Dutton, Georgia (United States), Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3401640-kill-for-me
