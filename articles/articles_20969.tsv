Murder as a Fine Art	Thomas De Quincey #1	David Morrell, Ä°smet Birkan	3.91	7260	1019	Gaslit London is brought to its knees in David Morrell's brilliant historical thriller. Thomas De Quincey, infamous for his memoir 'Confessions of an English Opium-Eater', is the major suspect in a series of ferocious mass murders identical to ones that terrorized London forty-three years earlier. The blueprint for the killings seems to be De Quincey's essay "On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts." Desperate to clear his name but crippled by opium addiction, De Quincey is aided by his devoted daughter Emily and a pair of determined Scotland Yard detectives. In 'Murder as a Fine Art', David Morrell plucks De Quincey, Victorian London, and the Ratcliffe Highway murders from history. Fogbound streets become a battleground between a literary star and a brilliant murderer, whose lives are linked by secrets long buried but never forgotten.	358	January 1st 2013	Thomas De Quincey, Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, Sean Ryan, Joseph Becker, Emily De Quincey, Margaret Jewell, Colonel Robert Brookline, Dr. John Snow, Sir Richard Mayne	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790878-murder-as-a-fine-art
