This is All: The Pillow Book of Cordelia Kenn	The Dance Sequence #6	Aidan Chambers	4.30	2127	232	From the winner of the Michael L. Printz Award and the Carnegie Medal, a work of astonishing intimacy and depth Using a pillow book as her form, nineteen-year-old Cordelia Kenn sets out to write out her life for her unborn daughter. What emerges is a portrait of an extraordinary girl, who writes frankly of love, sex, poetry, nature, faith, and of herself in the world. Her thoughts range widely: on Shakespeare and breasts, periods and piano playing, friendship and trees, consciousness and sleep, and much more besides. As she writes of William Blacklin, the boy she chooses as her first lover, or Julie, the teacher who encourages her spiritual life, Cordelia maddens, fascinates, and ultimately seduces the reader. This is a character never to be forgotten from a writer at the height of his powers.	816	October 25th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/590348.This_is_All
