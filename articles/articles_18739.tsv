The Oldest Living Vampire Tells All	The Oldest Living Vampire Saga #1	Joseph Duncan	3.85	867	73	"My legal name where I currently reside in the city of Liege, Belgium, in the year 2010 A.D., is Gaspar Valessi, but that is not my real name. The name I was given some 30,000 years ago, when I was born in a Paleolithic settlement in the region that is now called Germany-- the name my father gave me shortly after I was voided, bloody and howling, from my mother's womb-- is Gon." So begins the saga of the immortal Gon, a 30,000 year old vampire. This, the first volume of his memoirs, recounts his human life in Paleolithic Germany alongside his companion Brulde and his two wives Eyya and Nyala, and details the fearsome events that lead to his transformation from man to undying monster.	270	September 22nd 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20716977-the-oldest-living-vampire-tells-all
