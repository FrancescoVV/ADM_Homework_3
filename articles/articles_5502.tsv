Desires of the Dead	The Body Finder #2	Kimberly Derting	4.06	22793	1614	The missing dead call to Violet. They want to be found. Violet can sense the echoes of those who've been murdered and the matching imprint that clings to their killers. Only those closest to her know what she is capable of, but when she discovers the body of a young boy she also draws the attention of the FBI, threatening her entire way of life. As Violet works to keep her morbid ability a secret, she unwittingly becomes the object of a dangerous obsession. Normally, she'd turn to her best friend, Jay, except now that they are officially a couple, the rules of their relationship seem to have changed. And with Jay spending more and more time with his new friend Mike, Violet is left with too much time on her hands as she wonders where things went wrong. But when she fills the void by digging into Mike's tragic family history, she stumbles upon a dark truth that could put everyone in danger.	355	February 15th 2011	Violet Ambrose, Jules, Jay Heaton, Claire Amadeus, Megan Russo, Mike Russo, Sara Priest, Rafe Lowell, Ed Russo, Chelsea Morrison, Lissie Adams	Washington (state) (United States), Buckley, Washington (United States), Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7827221-desires-of-the-dead
