Chasing Tail	Lions in the City #1	Celia Kyle	3.91	1923	160	Werelioness Penelope Little has a growling lion pacing the library’s shelves. Not just any lion, either. He’s the most powerful feline in the country. And for some reason, he’s got his sights set on curvy, slightly nerdy, and totally frumpy Penny Not-So-Little. When he finally calms enough to shift… Well, gorgeous doesn’t begin to describe him. He’s sexy, sinful, and has a smile that nearly brings her to her knees. Even better, he’s all hers. Or is he? When a witch is involved in his sudden appearance, there’s no telling. **Stand alone, no cliffhangers.** Quick & Furry: Love, Laughs, and a Bit of Rawr on the Go.
