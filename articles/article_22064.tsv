All over You	Devoured #0.5	Emily Snow	4.05	17354	874	Before Sienna was devoured, before Lucas was consumed, they were all over each other . . . Lucas Wolfe is used to getting what he wants—from everyone but one person, that is—so when he meets the wardrobe assistant hired to work his band’s newest video, he’s got to have her. From the moment Sienna first obediently whispers “Yes, Mr. Wolfe”, he knows she’s perfect for him. Three days. And he’ll have her stripped down and bound to his bed. Set two years before the events of DEVOURED, ALL OVER YOU is the story of Sienna and Lucas’s first encounter.	57	November 30th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16161536-all-over-you
