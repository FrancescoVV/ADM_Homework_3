Kestrel's Midnight Song		J.R. Parker	4.01	197	43	The land of Gable--renowned for its birds, revered for its legends and secrets--is home to the grandest castle in the known world. Inside this castle, in a narrow cell atop the dungeon tower, the legendary Marauder known as James Kestrel awaits his hanging. Amidst the anticipation and speculation surrounding his execution, rumors are spreading that the Marauders will come out of hiding for the first time in seven years to free Kestrel and unleash the secret he so carefully guards. But only a wandering giant and a slave girl masquerading as an innkeeper know the truth. And everything will fall to the shoulders of a journeying shepherd boy . . . with no knowledge that his treacherous adventure will decide the pending fate of the world.	256	September 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8214792-kestrel-s-midnight-song
