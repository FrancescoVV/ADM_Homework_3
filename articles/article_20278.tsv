Smoke and Mirrors		Andrew James Pritchard	3.75	4	0	Ian Kenniger began to wonder why he had ever trusted his wife Clare, or his business associate James, or Sakun and her partners, yet no matter how he looked at those situations he would return to the same conclusion, it was because he had wanted to trust them, whether there was any reason to do so or not. It’s like when people watch a magician doing a slight-of-hand trick, or a stage hypnotist putting people under his control, they are amazed as if a coin really was pulled from out of someone’s ear, or someone was made to look like a fool. Yet it’s all done by smoke and mirrors; it all might look quite elaborate, but really all it takes is a few simple props and a bit of smooth talking to fool everyone.	99	December 2012		United States of America, Nepal, Pokhara (Nepal), Asia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17193192-smoke-and-mirrors
