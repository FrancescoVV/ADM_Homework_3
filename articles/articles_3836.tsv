Nothing Lasts Forever		Sidney Sheldon	3.85	29779	863	Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she'd need something more than the brains God gave her. Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.	384	1994	Paige Tayler, Kat Hunter, Honey Taft	United States of America, San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43325.Nothing_Lasts_Forever
