Digital Knight		Ryk E. Spoor	3.72	740	23	Jason Wood was just an information specialist - finding data for research, enhancing photos for the police, a nice, usually quiet profession whose only dangers came from and occasional crook trying to eliminate the evidence. The a body with two holes in its neck and no blood left turned up at his back door, and he found himself dealing with the kind of information that can get a man killed, or worse, much worse. Being chased by things out of myth and nightmare, Jason has only two weapons: his best friend, and his won quick wits. In a battle against darkness, the brightest weapon is the light of reason.	378	September 30th 2003		New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/638595.Digital_Knight
