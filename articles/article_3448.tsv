Passion Unleashed	Demonica #3	Larissa Ione	4.29	34741	1197	FORBIDDEN TEMPTATIONS Serena Kelley is an archaeologist and treasure hunter-and a woman with a secret. Since she was seven, she's been the keeper of a powerful charm that grants her health and immortality . . . as long as she stays a virgin. But Serena isn't all that innocent. And when a dangerously handsome stranger brings her to the brink of ecstasy, she wonders if she's finally met the one man she cannot resist. FATAL DESIRES Wraith is a Seminus demon with a death wish. But when an old enemy poisons him, he must find Serena and persuade her to give him the only known antidote in the universe-her charm. Yet, as she begins to surrender to his seductions and Wraith senses the cure is within his grasp, he realizes a horrible truth: He's falling for the woman whose life he must take in order to save his own.	454	March 31st 2009	Shade, Tayla Mancuso, Eidolon, Runa Wagner, Serena Kelley, Wraith (Demonica series), Kynan Morgan, Reaver, Lore, Gemella Endri, Luc, Karlene Lucio, Regan Cooper	Egypt, New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4701550-passion-unleashed
