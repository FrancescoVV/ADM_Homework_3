Midnight Sun [2008 Draft]		Stephenie Meyer	4.02	147013	9494	The record for the completed novel can be found here . Midnight Sun is the much anticipated retelling of Twilight from Edward Cullen's perspective. An unedited partial draft was illegally leaked onto the internet in 2008; consequently, author Stephenie Meyer put the project on indefinite hold. Shortly afterward, she posted a letter to her fans on her website including a link to the entire partial draft of the book so that those who wanted to read it could do so legally and with her consent. Note: Do not add a cover. Do not add translations. Do not add any other editions. Do not combine with editions of the full work. Do not add this book record to any series.	264	August 28th 2008	Edward Cullen, Jacob Black, Bella Swan, Billy Black, Esme Cullen, Alice Cullen, Jasper Hale, Carlisle Cullen, Rosalie Hale, Charlie Swan, Emmett Cullen, Mike Newton, Angela Weber	Washington (state) (United States), Alaska (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4502877-midnight-sun-2008-draft
