It Can't Happen Here		Sinclair Lewis, Michael R. Meyer	3.77	14957	2531	The only one of Sinclair Lewis's later novels to match the power of Main Street, Babbitt , and Arrowsmith, It Can't Happen Here is a cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America. Written during the Great Depression when America was largely oblivious to Hitler's aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a President who becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, rampant promiscuity, crime, and a liberal press. Now finally back in print, It Can't Happen Here remains uniquely important, a shockingly prescient novel that's as fresh and contemporary as today's news.	400	October 1935	Doremus Jessup, Berzelius Windrip, Shad Ledue, Francis Tasbrough, Lee Sarason, Dewey Haik	United States of America, Washington, D.C.
