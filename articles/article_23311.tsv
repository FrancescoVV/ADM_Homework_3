Confessions of an Air Hostess		Marisa Mackle	3.43	352	37	Poor Annie. Dumped by her boyfriend via text this morning while en route to the airport, she can think of better things to do than stand on a plane demonstrating emergency procedure and pointing out low-level lighting to hundreds of uninterested passengers. But what's a cabin-crew gal to do when her love life hits turbulence? Annie bravely resolves to keep smiling through her fake tan - while there's still a plane to catch, there's still pastures new to discover. And one of these days she's sure to really meet Mr Right. Isn't she? A great love story and a fantastic, loveable heroine combine to make this a romantic novel that's simply not to be missed.	288	June 14th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1229210.Confessions_of_an_Air_Hostess
