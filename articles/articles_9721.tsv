Ruining Me	Ruining #1	Nicole Reed	4.04	13931	1162	Eighteen year old Jay Stevenson is living a horrible nightmare. Two years ago, she had the world in the palm of her hand, but in one moment, it was ruined. Secrets, lies, and the worst imaginable betrayal haunt her new reality. Burying her problems under a cold façade seems to be the only way to cope until it all catches up with her. Soon, she loses control of the lonely world she built around her, and the past, present, and future collide. Three guys are there when it all comes crashing down: JT, the perfect boyfriend she never wanted to give up; Rhye, the local bad boy “rock star” who made her forget the past; and Kane, the funny and sweet tattooed bartender who wants her future. Secrets must be kept. Choices must be made. Is it possible to move forward while still chained to the wicked vices of the past?	149	September 26th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17260623-ruining-me
