The Man in the High Castle		Philip K. Dick	3.62	175891	11691	It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war â€” and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan. This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.	259	October 1962	Nobusuke Tagomi, Rudolf Wegener, Frank Frink, Juliana Frink, Robert Childan, Paul Kasoura, Betty Kasoura, Ed McCarthy, Hawthorne Abendsen, Joe Cinnadella, Wyndam-Matson	San Francisco, California (United States), California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216363.The_Man_in_the_High_Castle
