She can't hear his voice, except for the faint whispers in her mind. Most would think she's crazy, but she knows he's here. Jackson. The boy Ava thought she'd spend the rest of her life with. He's back from the dead, as proof that love truly knows no bounds.	227	January 8th 2008	Ava Bender, Jackson Montgomery, Cali, Lyric	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1832749.I_Heart_You_You_Haunt_Me
