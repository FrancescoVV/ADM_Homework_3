Breathe, Annie, Breathe	Hundred Oaks	Miranda Kenneally	4.08	9085	980	From the bestselling author of Catching Jordan comes a contemporary YA you won't forget. The finish line is only the beginning.… Annie hates running. No matter how far she jogs, she can't escape the guilt that if she hadn't broken up with Kyle, he might still be alive. So to honor his memory, she starts preparing for the marathon he intended to race. But the training is even more grueling than Annie could have imagined. Despite her coaching, she's at war with her body, her mind-and her heart. With every mile that athletic Jeremiah cheers her on, she grows more conflicted. She wants to run into his arms...and sprint in the opposite direction. For Annie, opening up to love again may be even more of a challenge than crossing the finish line.	306	July 15th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16045306-breathe-annie-breathe
