Last Stand at Saber River		Elmore Leonard	3.79	797	69	A quiet, haunted man, Paul Cable walked away from a lost cause hoping to pick up where he left off. But things have changed in Arizona since he first rode out to go fight for the Confederacy. Two brothers—Union men—have claimed his spread and they're not about to give it back, leaving Cable and his family no place to settle in peace. It seems this war is not yet over for Paul Cable. But no one's going to take away his land and his future—not with their laws, their lies, or their guns.	256	1959			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/288958.Last_Stand_at_Saber_River
