The Eyes of Kid Midas		Neal Shusterman	3.56	818	77	What if a seventh grader could have everything he wanted? He'd make ice-cream cones materialize out of nowhere and zap up every video game he'd ever wanted, right? But what if he was also tired of being bullied and all it took to change that was to put on a pair of sunglasses? Kevin Midas's new look is more than just for style -- he's out for revenge!	182	1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/454575.The_Eyes_of_Kid_Midas
