Secrets from the Vinyl Cafe	Vinyl Cafe #5	Stuart McLean	4.20	992	79	Every family has its secrets.When you commit acts of arson during Christmas dinner, attempt to start a life of crime by shoplifting a lipstick, or sink your false teeth into the forbidden pleasure of corn on the cob, it’s hard to come clean. But Stuart McLean has got the goods on Dave and his family.Morley, for example, is reluctant to talk about her beauty parlour betrayal and that other man in her life—Mathieu—while Dave tries to avoid mentioning his assault on an innocent dentist. These are the things they wouldn’t tell you themselves: lies, white and otherwise, aliases, double lives, and all manner of petty crimes and everyday transgressions. These are the Secrets from the Vinyl Cafe .	274	September 27th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1591730.Secrets_from_the_Vinyl_Cafe
