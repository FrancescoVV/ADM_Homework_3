Rx		Tracy Lynn	3.54	2387	161	Thyme Gilchrest is an honors student. Thyme Gilchrest is popular. Thyme Gilchrest is on student council. Thyme Gilchrest is a drug dealer. Like piecing together a logic puzzle, Thyme has organized a complex trading system that enables her to obtain the meds her friends need. They all come to her to diagnose their problems and provide the "cure" -- be it Prozac, Ritalin, Vicodin...She's therapist, doctor, and pharmacist all in one. She helps people. And that makes her feel a little more in control -- a little more capable of dealing with her own frantic high school life. Because Thyme Gilchrest is nothing if not good at dealing.	272	December 1st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183087.Rx
