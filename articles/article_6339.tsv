Five Point Someone: What Not to Do at IIT		Chetan Bhagat	3.43	82978	2213	Five Point Someone is a story about three friends in IIT who are unable to cope. The book starts with a disclaimer, “This is not a book to teach you how to get into IIT or even how to live in college. In fact, it describes how screwed up things can get if you don’t think straight.” Three hostelmates – Alok, Hari and Ryan get off to a bad start in IIT – they screw up the first class quiz. And while they try to make amends, things only get worse. It takes them a while to realize: If you try and screw with the IIT system, it comes back to double screw you. Before they know it, they are at the lowest echelons of IIT society. They have a five-point-something GPA out of ten, ranking near the end of their class. This GPA is a tattoo that will remain with them, and come in the way of anything else that matters – their friendship, their future, their love life. While the world expects IITians to conquer the world, these guys are struggling to survive. Will they make it? Do under performers have a right to live? Can they show that they are not just a five-point-somebody but a five-point-someone?	267	2004	Hari, Ryan Cooper, Alok, Neha, Professor Cherian, Venkat	IIT Delhi	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105576.Five_Point_Someone
