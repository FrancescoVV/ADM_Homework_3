Paige Turned	Paige Alder #3	Erynn Mangum	4.30	410	48	Despite her valiant efforts, Paige Alder seems stuck in chaos. Her new job as youth intern keeps her hopping from coffee shop to coffee shop all summer long, but at least she's loving the one-on-one time she gets to spend with the girls. The unfortunate side-effect is that now, four weeks of laundry fills her apartment. Plus, she barely has time to help her sister and best friend with their weddings! And even worse? Something is definitely wrong between her and Tyler. She apologized for what he thought he saw happen with Luke. Can't they move past it? Or could there be something he's not telling her--something that could change everything?This is the third and final book in the Paige Alder series.	288	March 11th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18124599-paige-turned
