When God Was a Rabbit		Sarah Winman	3.71	36598	3337	When God was a Rabbit is an incredibly exciting debut from an extraordinary new voice in fiction. Spanning four decades, from 1968 onwards, this is the story of a fabulous but flawed family and the slew of ordinary and extraordinary incidents that shape their everyday lives. It is a story about childhood and growing up, loss of innocence, eccentricity, familial ties and friendships, love and life. Stripped down to its bare bones, itâ€™s about the unbreakable bond between a brother and sister.	325	March 3rd 2011	Elly, Ginger, Charlie Harris, Jenny Penny, Nancy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8874743-when-god-was-a-rabbit
