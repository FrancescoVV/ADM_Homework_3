Speaking from Among the Bones	Flavia de Luce  #5	Alan Bradley	4.17	32496	3672	Eleven-year-old amateur detective and ardent chemist Flavia de Luce is used to digging up clues, whether they’re found among the potions in her laboratory or between the pages of her insufferable sisters’ diaries. What she is not accustomed to is digging up bodies. Upon the five-hundredth anniversary of St. Tancred’s death, the English hamlet of Bishop’s Lacey is busily preparing to open its patron saint’s tomb. Nobody is more excited to peek inside the crypt than Flavia, yet what she finds will halt the proceedings dead in their tracks: the body of Mr. Collicutt, the church organist, his face grotesquely and inexplicably masked. Who held a vendetta against Mr. Collicutt, and why would they hide him in such a sacred resting place? The irrepressible Flavia decides to find out. And what she unearths will prove there’s never such thing as an open-and-shut case.	378	January 29th 2013	Flavia de Luce, Ophelia de Luce, Daphne de Luce, Dogger, Mrs. Mullet, Inspector Hewitt, Colonel de Luce, Ophelia 'Feely' de Luce, Daphne 'Daffy' de Luce, Marmaduke Parr, Dieter Schrantz, Crispin Savoy Collicutt, Denwyn Richardson, Antigone Hewitt, Adam Tradescant Sowerby, Constable Linnet, Vivian Joyous aka Jocelyn Ridley-Smith, Miss Tanty, Patsy Pickery, Cassandra Cottlestone, Cynthia Richardson, Tarquin de Luce, Margaret Mullet, Sheila Foster, Quentin Ridley-Smith		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642963-speaking-from-among-the-bones
