Savor	The Empire Chronicles #4	Alyssa Rose Ivy	4.31	964	52	Jared is Vera's perfect manâ€”until he opens his mouth. An incredible body and set of wings can only go so far when everything he says seems designed to make her mad. Still, she can't deny her intense attraction or the fact that he is the closest thing she has to a friend. Jared doesn't go for bear shifters, especially ones that are related to his ex, but he can't resist Vera's charm or the way she understands him better than anyone else. As suspicions build and loyalties are tested, Vera and Jared realize that they may not be able to trust anyone but each other.		April 28th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23433197-savor
