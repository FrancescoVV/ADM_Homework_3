13 Treasures	Thirteen Treasures #1	Michelle Harrison	4.04	9182	992	No one else can see the evil fairies that rouse Tanya from her sleep, torturing her at the slightest mention of their existence, but they are as real to the 13-year-old as anything she's ever known. She cannot rid herself of them, nor can she ignore them. But it is her insistence on responding to them that has her banished to her grandmother's secluded countryside manor. There is much to explore and even more to fear in the woods surrounding the estate. But, the forest isn't the only source of dark secrets, and Tanya soon finds herself entangled in a mystery that could trap her in the fairy realm forever.	368	January 5th 2009	Raven, Amos, Tanya, Fabian, Rowan, Warwick, Gredin, Mad Morag, Feathercap, Florence		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6581334-13-treasures
