Monstrous Regiment	Discworld #31	Terry Pratchett	4.19	62702	1870	Polly Perks joins the Discworld army to find her brother Paul. "Ozzer" cuts off her blonde braids, dons male garb, belches, scratches, and masters macho habits - aided by well-placed pair of socks. The legendary and seemingly ageless Sergeant Jackrum accepts her plus a vampire, troll, zombie, religious fanatic, and two close "friends". The best man for the job may be a woman.	496	September 25th 2003	Sam Vimes, William de Worde, Angua von Ãœberwald, Otto Chriek, Reg Shoe, Polly Perks, Buggy Swires, Nuggan, Strappi, Jackrum, Maladicta, Igorina, Jade, Tonker Halter, Shufti Manickle, Wazzer Goom, Lofty Tewt	Discworld, Borogravia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34511.Monstrous_Regiment
