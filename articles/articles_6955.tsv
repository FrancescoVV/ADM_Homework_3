My Swordhand is Singing	My Swordhand is Singing #1	Marcus Sedgwick	3.64	2550	365	WHEN TOMAS AND HIS SON, Peter, settle in Chust as woodcutters, Tomas digs a channel of fast-flowing waters around their hut, so they have their own little island kingdom. Peter doesn't understand why his father has done this, nor why his father carries a long, battered box, whose mysterious contents he is forbidden to know. But Tomas is a man with a past: a past that is tracking him with deadly intent, and when the dead of Chust begin to rise from their graves, both father and son must face a soulless enemy and a terrifying destiny.	224	July 25th 2006		Khust (Ukraine), Romania	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1840934.My_Swordhand_is_Singing
