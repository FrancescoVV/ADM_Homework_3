Last Rite	Personal Demons #3	Lisa Desrochers	3.95	1649	142	In this final installment of the thrilling, edgy Personal Demons series, the battle between Heaven and Hell has become critical, and Frannie Cavanaugh is right at the center of it. With the help of the powerful angel Gabe and demon-turned-mortal Luc, Frannie has been able to stay one step ahead of the forces of Hell. But when the demons killed Frannie's best friend and destroyed her brother, they raised the stakes. If Frannie wants to keep her family and friends safe, she knows she has no choice but to go on the run. Their best defense is the power Frannie has been struggling to master, but her attempts to hone her skill go horribly awry. If Frannie doesn't learn fast, the consequences could be devastating--even apocalyptic. What happens when you can't outrun Hell...or trust the ones you love?	365	May 8th 2012	Frannie Cavanaugh, Luc Cain		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13037689-last-rite
