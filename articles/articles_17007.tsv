Intron Depot	Intron Depot	Masamune Shirow	4.13	189	7	Japanese artist Masamune Shirow is well known to discriminating comics readers. American editions of his spectacular graphic epics have been highly praised and voraciously collected. Now, his gorgeous and highly detailed color art has been collected for the first time into a single, handsome trade paperback. Beautifully printed in Japan and featuring text in both Japanese and English, this package features nearly two hundred full-color Shirow works, 47 published for the first time anywhere in the world! This book is a nearly complete archive of Shirow's color work from 1981 to 1991, including material from Appleseed, Dominion, Black Magic, Orion, and much more. This is an absolute must for fans of Shirow, science-fiction and fantasy art, and manga.	117	July 14th 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111630.Intron_Depot
