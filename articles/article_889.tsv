The Bhagavad Gita		Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, Simon Brodbeck, Juan Mascar√≥	4.13	55390	2022	The Bhagavad Gita is an early epic poem that recounts the conversation between Arjuna the warrior and his charioteer Krishna, the manifestation of God. In the moments before a great battle, the dialogue sets out the important lessons Arjuna must learn to change the outcome of the war he is to fight, and culminates in Krishna revealing to the warrior his true cosmic form, counselling him to search for the universal perfection of life. Ranging from instructions on yoga postures to dense moral discussion, the Gita is one of the most important Hindu texts, as well as serving as a practical guide to living well.	160	-400	Arjuna, Krishna, Sanjaya, King Dhrtarastra, Dhrstadyumna, Dronacharya	India	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99944.The_Bhagavad_Gita
