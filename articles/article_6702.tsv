One Day You Will (An Attorney J.B. Graybourne Novel #2)		Kristofer Clarke	4.38	16	4	Syreeta Mercer, a successful Lawyer from Atlanta, lived her life as daddy’s little girl, and she wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. She’s known only one man as her father, but two weeks after laying him to rest, she is startled by the news that this might not be her truth and everyone else’s lie. Against her mother’s wishes and warnings, Syreeta embarks on her own search that may result in more harm than good, revealing a reality from which she has been protected. Is she better off leaving well enough alone? Jelani Graybourne was the man of many women's dreams. He’s lived a successful, mistake-free life, until he met the one mistake that was Samantha Wells. She’s made promises she always kept. Now, she’s back, and unlike her first time around, loving Jelani might not be the first thing on her mind. If she has her way, her plan could topple the foundation on which the Graybourne brand is built. Jelani was able to avoid her ruin once, but could he avert her devious plot again? Is there someone else with an equally malicious intent?	250	February 24th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35717446-one-day-you-will
