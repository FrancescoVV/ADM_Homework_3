With All My Soul	Soul Screamers #7	Rachel Vincent	4.31	8783	831	What does it mean when your school is voted the most dangerous in America? It's time to kick some hellion butt... After not really surviving her junior year (does "undead" count as survival?), Kaylee Cavanaugh has vowed to take back her school from the hellions causing all the trouble. She's going to find a way to turn the incarnations of Avarice, Envy and Vanity against one another in order to protect her friends and finish this war, once and forever. But then she meets Wrath and understands that she's closer to the edge than she's ever been. And when one more person close to her is taken, Kaylee realizes she can't save everyone she loves without risking everything she has....	377	March 19th 2013	Kaylee Cavanaugh, Nash Hudson, Emma Marshall, Tod Hudson, Sabine Campbell		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13508069-with-all-my-soul
