No One Here Gets Out Alive		Danny Sugerman, Jerry Hopkins	3.92	38686	794	Here is Jim Morrison in all his complexity-singer, philosopher, poet, delinquent-the brilliant, charismatic, and obsessed seeker who rejected authority in any form, the explorer who probed "the bounds of reality to see what would happen..." Seven years in the writing, this definitive biography is the work of two men whose empathy and experience with Jim Morrison uniquely prepared them to recount this modern tragedy: Jerry Hopkins, whose famous Presley biography, Elvis, was inspired by Morrison's suggestion, and Danny Sugerman, confidant of and aide to the Doors. With an afterword by Michael McClure.	384	1980	Jim Morrison, Bill Siddons, Danny Fields, Patricia Kennely	Los Angeles, California (United States), New York City, New York (United States), San Francisco, California (United States), Paris (France) Sunset Strip, Hollywood, California (United States) Albuquerque, New Mexico (United States), Paris (France), Sunset Strip, Hollywood, California (United States), Albuquerque, New Mexico (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/691520.No_One_Here_Gets_Out_Alive
