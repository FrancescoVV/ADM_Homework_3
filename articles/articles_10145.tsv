The Truth About Alice		Jennifer Mathieu	3.64	13586	2502	Everyone knows Alice slept with two guys at one party. But did you know Alice was sexting Brandon when he crashed his car? It's true. Ask ANYBODY. Rumor has it that Alice Franklin is a slut. It's written all over the bathroom stall at Healy High for everyone to see. And after star quarterback Brandon Fitzsimmons dies in a car accident, the rumors start to spiral out of control. In this remarkable debut novel, four Healy High students—the girl who has the infamous party, the car accident survivor, the former best friend, and the boy next door—tell all they know. But exactly what is the truth about Alice? In the end there's only one person to ask: Alice herself.	209	June 3rd 2014		Healy, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068341-the-truth-about-alice
