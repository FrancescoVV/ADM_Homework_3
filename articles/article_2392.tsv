The Sugar Queen		Sarah Addison Allen	3.98	49446	5617	Twenty-seven-year-old Josey is sure of three things: winter in her North Carolina hometown is her favorite season; she's a sorry excuse for a Southern belle; and sweets are best eaten in the privacy of her hidden closet. For while Josey has settled into an uneventful life in her mother's house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary treats and paperback romances she escapes to each night ...Until she finds her closet harboring none other than local waitress Della Lee Baker, a tough-talking, tender-hearted woman who is one part nemesis - and two parts fairy godmother ...	290	May 20th 2008	Josey Cirrini, Della Lee Baker, Chloe Finley	Bald Slope, North Carolina (United States), North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11648261-the-sugar-queen
