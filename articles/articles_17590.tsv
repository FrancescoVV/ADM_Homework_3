The Sorrow's Garden		Anthony Carinhas	4.27	60	20	Successful and well-known as an architect and writer in 1938 Leipzig, Germany, the talented and skilled Radulf is repulsed by the chaotic nature of other people's selfish living. Ironically, he is tormented by a dark secret lurking deep within the shadows of his own psyche: the fact that his own character is completely devoid of principles and morals. Radulf is driven to hone other skills in an extremely sinister craft-a pastime that both amuses and consumes him-in spite of the destruction it may cause. Antagonized by a hidden world haunted by disturbing nightmares, he is compelled to lure carefully-selected individuals into his tailor-made illusions where he wins their trust and preys with lust upon their innocence and trusting nature.	106	April 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54954209-sorrow-s-garden
