Zany Hijinx!		Tom Waters	4.00	2	0	Zany Hijinx is the evolution of Tom Watersa contribution as an essayist over the course of ten years. From young adulthood to his mid-20s, we get his personal, quirky viewpoint on a number of subjects: dentists, college, dating, fashion trends, hunting, football, and a score of other bizarre, off-beat rants. Irreverant, obnoxious, outspoken, and critically awarded and praised, Watersa work has appeared in The Buffalo News, ArtVoice, and Night Life magazine.	466	February 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2338189.Zany_Hijinx_
