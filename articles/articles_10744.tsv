The Winds of War & War & Remembrance		Herman Wouk	4.57	893	44	These two classic works capture the tide of world events even as they unfold the compelling tale of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom. The multimillion-copy bestsellers that capture all the drama, romance, heroism, and tragedy of the Second World War  and that constitute Wouk's crowning achievement  are available for the first time in trade paperback.
