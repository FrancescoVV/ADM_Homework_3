Going Back to Zen: Where to Find Peace So You Can Live Like Mad		Janine Vance	4.96	53	21	We live in a world that glorifies and glamorizes whoever has the most money, and whoever shines the most brightly. But is being top dog synonymous with happiness? The evidence suggests, no. If so, the richest among us would be immune to humiliation, grief, depression, and anxiousness etc.. All of these emotions are significant parts of the human condition regardless of age, economic status, religion, and ethnic background. I have found that comfort, acceptance, and humor prevails like wind beneath gilded wings. Sometimes, the higher we climb on that corporate ladder, the more we fear the potential fall. When we are on the bottom rung, we can appreciate the ground below which houses our roots. When forced to see from the ground up (or the back alley), we are led to a transformational and fulfilling life. For myself, this evolution has led me to my ethnic roots and recoup all that it provides.	152	September 28th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42172916-going-back-to-zen
