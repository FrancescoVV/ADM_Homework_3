The Scribblings of a Madcap Shambleton		Noel Fielding	4.25	658	54	A beautiful and hilarious new book of artwork from the star of The Mighty Boosh Noel Fielding's book channels the creative influences of Henri Rousseau, Roy Lichtenstein, and Salvador Dalí, through the comedian's strange, singular, and surreal mind. Hilarious and beautifully produced, this is a visual feast which will delight and entertain Noel's many impassioned fans. "Growing up in the jungles of India there was no need for drawing or painting. I would sometimes arrange ants into primitive still lives or scratch out portraits onto the trunks of trees. Things changed when I was 11, a lame tiger who owned a stationery shop gave me the keys to his stock room, I would roll around in acrylic and oil pastels in reverie, licking canvases and tucking coloured pencils into my wild hair. It was here I learned how to draw and paint well enough to be accepted into Croyden Art College. There, Dexter Dalwood (Turner Prize nominee) taught me and after two years under his supreme tutelage and much hard graft he advised me to become a comedian." — Noel Fielding	300	October 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11380935-the-scribblings-of-a-madcap-shambleton
