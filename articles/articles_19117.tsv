In the Dark		Sasha Lynn	5.00	2	0	The summer I turned eighteen, my world exploded. I was forbidden to go to college by my strict parents and was forced to stay home and help them run the farm. I gave up my dreams of higher education and a career of my own, obeying my parents and promising to become a wife and mother, and nothing else. I expected my parents would become more controlling than ever once I turned eighteen. I expected my father to hire more work hands for the acres of land and other work that needed to be done. I expected to be at my parent's beck and call. What I didn't expect was to meet the most beautifully tortured soul in a work hand that summer. And I most certainly did not expect to fall in love with him.	268	June 14th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40545344-in-the-dark
