The Killings At Badger's Drift	Chief Inspector Barnaby #1	Caroline Graham	3.95	6540	541	Badger's Drift is an ideal English village, complete with vicar, bumbling local doctor, and kindly spinster with a nice line in homemade cookies. But when the spinster dies suddenly, her best friend kicks up an unseemly fuss, loud enough to attract the attention of Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby. And when Barnaby and his eager-beaver deputy start poking around, they uncover a swamp of ugly scandals and long-suppressed resentments seething below the picture-postcard prettiness. In the grand tradition of the quietly intelligent copper, Barnaby has both an irresistibly dry sense of humor and a keen insight into what makes people tick. Badger's Drift marks Barnaby's debut, and offers ample proof that Caroline Graham may indeed be simply the best detective writer since Agatha Christie (Sunday Times of London).	256	1987			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256936.The_Killings_at_Badger_s_Drift
