The Gift		Vladimir Nabokov, Michael Scammell, Dmitri Nabokov	4.01	3330	206	The Gift is the last of the novels Nabokov wrote in his native Russian and the crowning achievement of that period in his literary career. It is also his ode to Russian literature, evoking the works of Pushkin, Gogol, and others in the course of its narrative: the story of Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, an impoverished émigré poet living in Berlin, who dreams of the book he will someday write--a book very much like The Gift itself.	403	1938	Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, Elizaveta Pavlovna, Zina Mertz	Berlin (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8147.The_Gift
