When Tillie is enlisted to help tame Mack's rugged behavior by tutoring him in the ways of refined society, the resulting sparks threaten Tillie's efforts to be chosen as Edith Vanderbilt's lady's maid. But the stakes rise even higher when Mack and Tillie become entangled in a cover-up at the town orphanage. They could both lose their jobs...and their hearts.	363	2010	Tillie Reese, Mack Danvers, Mackenzie Danver, Ora Lou Danvers, Mrs Winters, Lucy Lewers, Dixie Brown, Edith Stuyvesant Dresser Vanderbilt, Earl Danver, George Washington Vanderbilt III, Forbus Sloop, Mrs Sloop, Captain Hovious, Mr. Tarwater, Doc Kuppenheimer, Artie Alsup, Aaron James, Pilkerton, Allan Reese, Daphne Devine, Ora Lou Danver, Mrs. Reese, Mary Pamela DePriest, Leonard Vaughan, Ikey, Herbert Reese, Irene Martin, Louis Blomberg, Mr. Sterling, Tolene, Alice Breeding, Homer Nash, Bubby	Asheville, North Carolina (United States), North Carolina (United States), Biltmore House (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6973771-maid-to-match
