Storm	Ashes & Embers #1	Carian Cole	4.09	10474	1243	I had no idea crashing into a ditch would change my life forever. Fate had other plans, and I never stood a chance. A series of weather and road mishaps left me trapped in the middle of a blizzard with a complete stranger in the back of a pickup truck. For forty-eight freakin' hours. A stranger with long hair, tattoos, and rippling with muscle. A stranger with an insanely sexy voice and a smile that turned my insides to jelly. A stranger who held me in his arms, calmed me, and then set a fire in me that I couldn't put out. I didn't know I was trapped with America's favorite bad boy guitarist, Storm Valentine. And he was in no rush to reveal his secret. He's used to getting everything he wants, and for some reason, he's decided he wants me. Some people chase storms for the beautiful thrill. What happens when the storm chases you?	244	September 28th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42832526-storm
