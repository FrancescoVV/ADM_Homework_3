Grief is the Thing with Feathers		Max Porter	3.87	26011	3676	In a London flat, two young boys face the unbearable sadness of their mother's sudden death. Their father, a Ted Hughes scholar and scruffy romantic, imagines a future of well-meaning visitors and emptiness. In this moment of despair they are visited by Crow - antagonist, trickster, healer, babysitter. This self-described sentimental bird is attracted to the grieving family and threatens to stay until they no longer need him. As weeks turn to months and physical pain of loss gives way to memories, this little unit of three begin to heal. In this extraordinary debut - part novella, part polyphonic fable, part essay on grief, Max Porter's compassion and bravura style combine to dazzling effect. Full of unexpected humour and profound emotional truth, Grief is the Thing with Feathers marks the arrival of a thrilling new talent.	114	August 24th 2015	Crow (Gittwf), Dad (Gittwf), Boys (Gittwf)	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25334576-grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers
