In StrengthsFinder 2.0, Gallup unveils the new and improved version of its popular online assessment. With hundreds of strategies for applying your strengths, StrengthsFinder 2.0 will change the way you look at yourself and the world forever.	174	January 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56454.Strengths_Finder_2_0
