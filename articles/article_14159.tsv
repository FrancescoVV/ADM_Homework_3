Bound by Honor	Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles #1	Cora Reilly	4.05	34834	2662	A modern mafia fairytale. Born into one of the leading mob families in Chicago, Aria Scuderi is a mafia princess known for her beauty. What many consider a gift means her doom when she’s forced to marry Luca Vitiello to bring peace between two mafia dynasties. Luca is the future Capo of the New York Famiglia, a man known for his brutality—and for crushing his cousin’s throat with his bare hands. Aria is terrified of marrying a monster like him. He may be one of the most sought-after bachelors in New York, thanks to his good looks, wealth and predator-like charisma. But Aria knows the bad boy aura isn’t just a game; blood and death lurk beneath Luca’s striking gray eyes and arrogant smile. In her world a handsome exterior often hides the monster within; a monster who can just as easily kill as kiss you. Yet, there’s no escaping the arranged bond, much less a man like Luca. He’d follow her to the end of the world. Her only chance to survive in a marriage with Luca is to gain his affection and work her way into his heart—even when rumor has it that Luca doesn’t have a heart to begin with. A mafia princess known for her beauty given to a monstrous man. Even monsters have a heart. She has every intention of working her way into his.	273	December 6th 2014	Aria Scuderi, Luca Vitiello, Gianna Scuderi, Matteo Vittiello, Aria Scuderi	Chicago, Illinois (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51525075-bound-by-honor
