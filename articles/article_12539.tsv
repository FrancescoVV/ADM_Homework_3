He’s carried out his duty for two thousand years and never faltered once. Until he meets Nicole St. James.

Six months later, he finally manages to track Nicole to a bar in Mexico. He’s stunned to discover that the woman he remembers has undergone a dramatic change—she’s become a vampire. And when he realizes that she’s the target of all manner of enemies—other vampires, demons, even shifters—he’ll do whatever it takes to protect her, even if all hell breaks loose…	305	January 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10418404-angel-of-darkness
