A Kiss at Midnight	Fairy Tales #1	Eloisa James	3.80	16767	1541	Miss Kate Daltry doesn't believe in fairy tales . . . or happily ever after. Forced by her stepmother to attend a ball, Kate meets a prince... and decides he's anything but charming. A clash of wits and wills ensues, but they both know their irresistible attraction will lead nowhere. For Gabriel is promised to another womanâ€”a princess whose hand in marriage will fulfill his ruthless ambitions. Gabriel likes his fiancee, which is a welcome turn of events, but he doesn't love her. Obviously, he should be wooing his bride-to-be, not the witty, impoverished beauty who refuses to fawn over him. Godmothers and glass slippers notwithstanding, this is one fairy tale in which destiny conspires to destroy any chance that Kate and Gabriel might have a happily ever after. Unless a prince throws away everything that makes him noble... Unless a dowry of an unruly heart trumps a fortune... Unless one kiss at the stroke of midnight changes everything.	370	July 27th 2010	Katherine Daltry, Gabriel Albrecht-Frederick William von Aschenberg, Jonas Berwick, Mariana Daltry, Victoria Daltry	Lancashire, England, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6957682-a-kiss-at-midnight
