A Fall of Water	Elemental Mysteries #4	Elizabeth   Hunter	4.35	11994	632	“No secret stays hidden forever.” Still grieving from their loss in the far East, Giovanni Vecchio and Beatrice De Novo discover that for them, all roads really do lead to Rome. But nothing is quite as it seems in the Eternal City. Joined by Carwyn and Tenzin, unexpected clashes greet them almost immediately, and rivalries churn beneath the glittering facade of the old Roman court. They quickly realize that allies might be enemies, and ancient rivals could hold the key to a deadly secret. Giovanni and Beatrice will be forced to call on old alliances, ancient power, and fierce cunning to survive for the eternity they both desire. Sometimes, finding the end means going back to the beginning. Fire, Earth, Wind, and Water finally meet with devastating results in the conclusion of the Elemental Mysteries.	420	June 1st 2012	Beatrice De Novo, Giovanni 'Gio' Vecchio		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24558550-a-fall-of-water
