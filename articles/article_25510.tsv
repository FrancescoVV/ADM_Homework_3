DOCTOR MARI TEACHES ABOUT HEALTHY CONCEPTS OF GOD (Psychological Wholeness Series, #3)		Denise Marie Mari	5.00	1	0	Today, we find many adults and children who cannot really say “in God we trust.” Rather than taking responsibility for their own faults and weaknesses, the blame for all types of individual and family misfortunes has been placed unfairly upon the shoulders of God. Given this climate of antagonism, God’s reputation has become increasingly tarnished. In this book, health professional Denise Marie Mari, Ph.D. helps people un-cloud their views of God and reconnect with the Best Friend anyone can have. All proceeds from this book go to support clergy/religious programs of the House of Hope International. www.Lulu.com/spotlight/DoctorMari	12	December 17th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23931668-doctor-mari-teaches-about-healthy-concepts-of-god
