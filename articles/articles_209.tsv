Schindler's List		Thomas Keneally	4.34	145314	2281	In the shadow of Auschwitz, a flamboyant German industrialist grew into a living legend to the Jews of Cracow. He was a womaniser, a heavy drinker and a bon viveur, but to them he became a saviour. This is the extraordinary story of Oskar Schindler, who risked his life to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland and who was transformed by the war into a man with a mission, a compassionate angel of mercy.	429	October 18th 1982	Oskar Schindler, Amon Leopold Göth	Krakow (Kraków) (Poland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375013.Schindler_s_List
