Sevara: Dawn of Hope		Damian Wampler	3.67	43	28	When fifteen-year-old Sevara refuses to marry, she's kicked out of her orphanage and left on the streets of Plexus with nothing. She doesn't last long on the outside. Luckily, someone has been watching her. A shapeshifting immortal gives Sevara a second chance at life, and a powerful set of gifts. But when Sevara begins a doomed love affair with the man she could have married, she must choose between protecting the city and saving the only man she's ever loved. This is the beginning of a fantasy adventure that will span hundreds of lifetimes. With a strong female lead, this coming of age adventure is a haunting and heart-pounding thrill-ride.	274	July 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25829774-sevara
