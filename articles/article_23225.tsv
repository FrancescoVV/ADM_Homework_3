Kick Me: Adventures in Adolescence		Paul Feig	3.80	4120	276	Written in side-splitting and often cringe-inducing detail, Paul Feig takes you in a time machine to a world of bombardment by dodge balls, ill-fated prom dates, hellish school bus rides, and other aspects of public school life that will keep you laughing in recognition and occasionally sighing in relief that you arenâ€™t him. Kick Me is a nostalgic trip for the inner geek in all of us.	288	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95532.Kick_Me
