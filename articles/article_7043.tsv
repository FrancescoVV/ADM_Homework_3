Craving Constellations	The Aces #1	Nicole Jacquelyn	4.01	18890	1208	"How is it, that someone can make decision after decision attempting to get away from their past and somehow end up right back where they started?" When Brenna decided to leave the only life she'd ever known, she never thought she'd ever be back. Now, five years later she's running from her clean cut husband straight back to the motorcycle club that raised her... and the man she left behind. She left with a secret, and as soon as she returns the truth will break her carefully constructed life wide open.	305	August 27th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17859911-craving-constellations
