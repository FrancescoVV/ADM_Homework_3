Sharp Objects		Gillian Flynn	3.98	683521	45067	Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces a troubling assignment: she must return to her tiny hometown to cover the unsolved murder of a preteen girl and the disappearance of another. For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story—and survive this homecoming.	254	2006	Camille Preaker, Frank Curry, Amma Crellin, Adora Crellin, Chief Bill Vickery, Alan Crellin, Marian Crellin, Richard Willis, Ann Nash, Natalie Keene, John Keene, Meredith Wheeler, Katie Lacey, James Capisi, Annabelle Gasser and Jackie O'Neele, Gayla (Sharp Objects), Kylie, Kelsey and Kelsey	Wind Gap, Missouri (United States), Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18045891-sharp-objects
