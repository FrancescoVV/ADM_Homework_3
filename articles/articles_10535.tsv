Nobody Does it Better	Gossip Girl #7	Cecily von Ziegesar	3.62	11375	213	Welcome to New York City's Upper East Side, where my friends and I get everything - and everyone - we want. Snagging the latest Marc Jacobs bag or your best friend's boyfriend isn't always pretty, but it's always hot. Enter the world of Gossip Girl - a world where everyone is gorgeous, everything is fabulous, and jealousy and betrayal are everywhere you look. It's springtime and our lives are really heating up. Everybody's into college, and it's obviously time to party - as if we hadn't been doing that already! Now that B's finally lost her virginity to N, she can't wait to do it again (and again). But will B and N's love affair continue? And will B finally get into Yale? Or will N and S hook up and leave B alone in the city? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: love is in the air, and it smells a lot like Gucci Envy. You know you love me, gossip girl	231	May 2005	Serena van der Woodsen, Blair Waldorf, Nate Archibald, Charles "Chuck" Bass, Dan Humphrey, Jenny Humphrey, Vanessa Abrams		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22191.Nobody_Does_it_Better
