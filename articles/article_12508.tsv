One Foot in Eden		Ron Rash	4.13	4582	537	Will Alexander is the sheriff in a small town in southern Appalachia, and he knows that the local thug Holland Winchester has been murdered. The only thing is the sheriff can find neither the body nor someone to attest to the killing. Simply, almost elementally told through the voices of the sheriff, a local farmer, his beautiful wife, their son, and the sheriff's deputy, One Foot in Eden signals the bellwether arrival of one the most mature and distinctive voices in southern literature.	214	2002		South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545981.One_Foot_in_Eden
