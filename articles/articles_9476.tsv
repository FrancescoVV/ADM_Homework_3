Showdown	Paradise #1	Ted Dekker	3.94	13343	518	Welcome to Paradise. Epic battles of good and evil are happening all around us. Today that battle comes to town with the sound of lone footsteps clacking down the blacktop on a hot, lazy summer afternoon. The black-cloaked man arrives in the sleepy town of Paradise and manages to become the talk of the town within the hour. Bearing the power to grant any unfulfilled dream, he is irresistible. Seems like bliss . . . but is it? Or is hell about to break loose in Paradise?	367	January 15th 2005	Marsuvees Black, Billy Rediger		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/456057.Showdown
