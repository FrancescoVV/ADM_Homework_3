Wraithblade	The Wraithblade Saga #1	S.M. Boyce	4.76	34	20	Tonight, a merciless king dies alone in the forest. Tonight, a usurper rises from the ranks of trusted noblemen. Tonight, deadly enchantments are unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. At the center of it all is the most ruthless and powerful magic this land has ever seen. A specter of death. An undead warlord who now sits in the eye of an approaching storm, pulling on the strings of chaos. The Wraith King. But even an undead king’s power has limits, and he fuses with a mortal to survive. Though this blesses his new host with godlike abilities, all magic comes at a cost. As the weeks blur by, a question arises: will the mortal remain in control? Or will the ghost overtake the man who now holds the reins to his power? Are you ready to wield the Wraithblade? Gather your allies and pray to your gods if you have them, because it’s time to find out. Publisher's Note: At 235,000 words, Wraithblade is a sprawling epic that will snare your senses and whisk you away to a world you'll never want to leave. Betrayal. Monsters. Destruction. Shame. Enemies turned allies. Friends turned adversaries. Don't get too comfortable as you flip through these pages... because each twist or turn might well shatter everything you think you know.
