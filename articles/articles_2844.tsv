The Rings of Saturn		W.G. Sebald, Michael Hulse	4.25	10493	1108	The Rings of Saturn — with its curious archive of photographs — records a walking tour along the east coast of England. A few of the things which cross the path and mind of its narrator (who both is and is not Sebald) are lonely eccentrics, Sir Thomas Browne's skull, a matchstick model of the Temple of Jerusalem, recession-hit seaside towns, wooded hills, Joseph Conrad, Rembrandt's "Anatomy Lesson," the natural history of the herring, the massive bombings of WWII, the dowager empress Tzu Hsi, and the silk industry in Norwich.	296	1995	Joseph Conrad	East Anglia, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434903.The_Rings_of_Saturn
