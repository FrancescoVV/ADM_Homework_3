Stephanie's Ponytail		Robert Munsch, Michael Martchenko	4.27	3625	323	None of the kids in her class wear a ponytail, so Stephanie decides she must have one. The loud, unanimous comment from her classmates is: “Ugly, ugly, very ugly.” Steadfast, when all the girls have copied her ponytail, she resolves to try a new style. With true Munsch flair, each of Stephanie’s ponytails is more outrageous than the last, while the cast of copycats grows and grows.	24	May 1st 1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/285740.Stephanie_s_Ponytail
