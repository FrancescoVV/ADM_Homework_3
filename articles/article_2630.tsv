Out of the Dust		Karen Hesse	3.75	69603	4744	When Billie Jo is just fourteen she must endure heart-wrenching ordeals that no child should have to face. The quiet strength she displays while dealing with unspeakable loss is as surprising as it is inspiring. Written in free verse, this award-winning story is set in the heart of the Great Depression. It chronicles Oklahoma's staggering dust storms, and the environmental--and emotional--turmoil they leave in their path. An unforgettable tribute to hope and inner strength.	227	January 1st 1997	Billie Jo	United States of America, Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25346.Out_of_the_Dust
