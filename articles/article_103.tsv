Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire	Harry Potter #4	J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPr√©	4.56	2609448	46844	Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream). He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for hundreds of years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly.	734	July 8th 2000	Sirius Black, Draco Malfoy, Ron Weasley, Petunia Dursley, Vernon Dursley, Dudley Dursley, Severus Snape, Rubeus Hagrid, Lord Voldemort, Minerva McGonagall, Neville Longbottom, Fred Weasley, George Weasley, Percy Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Arthur Weasley, Molly Weasley, Cho Chang, Cornelius Fudge, Sybil Trelawney, Ludo Bagman, Bartemius Crouch, Bartemius Crouch, Jr., Fleur Delacour, Cedric Diggory, Viktor Krum, Bellatrix Lestrange, Alastor Moody, Rita Skeeter, Charlie Weasley, Bill Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger	London, England (United Kingdom), Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6.Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire
