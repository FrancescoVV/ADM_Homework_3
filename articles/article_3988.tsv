Swallowing Darkness	Merry Gentry #7	Laurell K. Hamilton	4.15	27869	770	I am Meredith, princess of faerie, wielder of the hands of Flesh and Blood, and at long last, I am with child–twins, fathered by my royal guard. Though my uncle, Taranis, King of Light and Illusion, claims that he is the true father since he abducted me from my home, betrayed, and defiled me. And now he has branded my guards as a threat to my unborn children. Bearing an heir has placed me halfway to my aunt’s throne, that much closer to my reign over the Unseelie Court–and well ahead of her son, my cousin Cel, in this race. Now I must stay alive to see my children born and claim my place as queen. But not all in faerie are pleased with the news, and conspirators from every court in the realm plot against me and mine. They seek to strip my guards, my lovers, from me by poisoned word or cold steel. But I still have supporters, and even friends, among the goblins and the sluagh, who will stand by me. I am Meredith Nic Essus, and those who would defy and destroy me are destined to pay a terrible price—for I am truly my father’s daughter. To protect what is mine, I will sacrifice anything—even if it means waging a great battle against my darkest enemies and making the most momentous decision ever made as princess of faerie.	365	November 4th 2008	Meredith "Merry" Gentry, Frost (Killing Frost), Mistral, Sholto, Doyle (Queen's Darkness), Rhys (Cromm Crauch), Galen (A Kiss of Shadows)	Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2798094-swallowing-darkness
