At the start of this heart-pounding new installment of the bestselling House of Night series, Zoey’s friends have her back again and Stevie Rae and the red fledglings aren’t Neferet’s secrets any longer. But an unexpected danger has emerged. Neferet guards her powerful new consort, Kalona, and no one at the House of Night seems to understand the threat he poses. Kalona looks gorgeous, and he has the House of Night under his spell. A past life holds the key to breaking his rapidly spreading influence, but what if this past life shows Zoey secrets she doesn’t want to hear and truths she can’t face?	323	2009	Zoey Redbird, Nyx (House of Night), Erik Night, Stevie Rae Johnson, Neferet, Heath Luck, Aphrodite LaFont, Kalona, Sylvia Redbird, Darius Langley	Tulsa, Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4134071-hunted
