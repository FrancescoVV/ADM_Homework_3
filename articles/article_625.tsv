Sense and Sensibility		Jane Austen, Tony Tanner, Ros Ballaster	4.07	961251	16840	'The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!' Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love—and its threatened loss—the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love. This edition includes explanatory notes, textual variants between the first and second editions, and Tony Tanner's introduction to the original Penguin Classic edition.	409	October 30th 1811	Elinor Dashwood, Marianne Dashwood, Edward Ferrars, Colonel Brandon, Lady Middleton, John Middleton, Mr. Dashwood, Mrs. John Dashwood, Mrs. Dashwood, John Willoughby	Devonshire, England, Sussex, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility
