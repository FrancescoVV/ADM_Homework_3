Eloise	Kay Thompson's Eloise	Kay Thompson, Hilary Knight	4.17	24098	567	Meet Eloise, the precocious darling of the Plaza Hotel! Eloise is a little girl who lives at The Plaza Hotel in New York. She is not yet pretty but she is already a Person. Henry James would want to study her. Queen Victoria would recognize her as an Equal. The New York Jets would want to have her on their side. Lewis Carroll would love her (once he got over the initial shock). She knows everything about The Plaza. She is interested in people when they are not boring. She has Inner Resources. If you take her home with you, you will always be glad you did.	65	1955	Mr. Salomone, Weenie, Skipperdee, Thomas, Bill, Nanny, Ren√©, Johanna, Joe, Vincent, Philip, Lily, Eloise		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/782854.Eloise
