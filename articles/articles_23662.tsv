When God Walked the Earth		Rick Joyner	4.32	76	6	After creation itself, the greatest miracle was when God Himself became a Man and walked upon the earth. He did this to show man how to become "a new creation," ascending into the heavenly realm with a spiritual nature. This book is about that most remarkable time from the perspective of both men and angels.	142	August 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2587444-when-god-walked-the-earth
