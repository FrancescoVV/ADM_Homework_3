The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power		Daniel Yergin	4.42	8666	752	The Prize recounts the panoramic history of oil -- and the struggle for wealth and power that has always surrounded oil. This struggle has shaken the world economy, dictated the outcome of wars, and transformed the destiny of men and nations. The Prize is as much a history of the twentieth century as of the oil industry itself. The canvas of history is enormous -- from the drilling of the first well in Pennsylvania through two great world wars to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Operation Desert Storm.	885	January 15th 1991		Kuwait, Middle East	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169354.The_Prize
