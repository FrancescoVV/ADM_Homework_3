Summer Lightning	Blandings Castle #4	P.G. Wodehouse	4.23	4387	355	The Honourable Galahad Threepwood has decided to write his memoir—a tell-all that could destroy polite society. Everyone wants this manuscript gone, particularly Lord Emsworth’s neighbor Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, who would do anything to keep the story of the prawns buried in the past. But the memoir isn’t the only problem. A chorus girl disguised as an heiress, a double-dealing detective, a stolen prize-winning sow, and a crazy ex-secretary are only a few of the complications that must be dealt with before everyone can have their happy ending.	288	July 1st 1929	Clarence Threepwood, Sebastian Beach, Rupert Baxter, Constance Keeble, Galahad Threepwood, George Alexander Pyke, Percy Frobisher Pilbeam, Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, Empress of Blandings, George Cyril Wellbeloved, Mac, Thomas, Alfred Voules, Puffy Benger, Julia Fish, Ronald Overbury Fish, Hugo Carmody, Pride of Matchingham, Sue Brown, Dolly Henderson, Pirbright, James, Millicent Threepwood, Mortimer Mason, Bashford, Bashford, Sally Field, McTeague, P.C.
