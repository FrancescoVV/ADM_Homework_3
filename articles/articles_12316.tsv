Kristy's Great Idea	Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novels #1	Raina Telgemeier, Ann M. Martin	4.18	39502	1331	In this new graphic novel edition of the very first Baby-Sitters Club book, Raina Telgemeier captures all the drama of the original in warm, spunky illustrations. Witness Kristy's eureka moment, when she gets the idea for a "baby-sitters club" and enlists her best friends, shy Mary Anne and artistic Claudia, in an exciting new venture. But the baby-sitting business isn't the only thing absorbing their attention: Kristy is having a hard time accepting her stepdad-to-be, and the newest member of the gang, Stacey, seems to be hiding a secret.	186	April 1st 2006		Stoneybrook, Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38424.Kristy_s_Great_Idea
