The Iceman Cometh		Eugene O'Neill, Harold Bloom	3.95	7614	251	Eugene O'Neill was the first American playwright to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. He completed The Iceman Cometh in 1939, but he delayed production until after the war, when it enjoyed a modest run in 1946 after receiving mixed reviews. Three years after O'Neill's death, Jason Robards starred in a Broadway revival that brought new critical attention to O'Neillâ€™s dark play. In the half century since, The Iceman Cometh has gained in stature. Kevin Spacey and James Earl Jones have played Hickey. The Iceman Cometh focuses on a group of alcoholics who endlessly discuss but never act on their dreams, and Hickey, the traveling salesman determined to strip them of their pipe dreams.	236	January 1st 1946	Cora, Pearl, Harry Hope, Ed Mosher, Pat McGloin, Willie Oban, Joe Mott, Piet Wetjoen (The General), Cecil Lewis (The Captain), James Cameron (Jimmy Tomorrow), Hugo Kalmar, Larry Slade, Rocky Pioggi, Don Parritt, Margie, Chuck Morello, Theodore Hickman (Hickey), Moran, Lieb	Greenwich Village, New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111734.The_Iceman_Cometh
