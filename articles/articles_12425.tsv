Full Moon	Blandings Castle #7	P.G. Wodehouse	4.17	2451	183	When the moon is full at Blandings, strange things happen: among them the commissioning of a portrait of The Empress, twice in succession winner in the Fat Pigs Class at the Shropshire Agricultural Show. What better choice of artist, in Lord Emsworth's opinion, than Landseer. The renowned painter of The Stag at Bay may have been dead for decades, but that doesn't prevent Galahad Threepwood from introducing him to the castle - or rather introducing Bill Lister, Gally's godson, so desperately in love with Prudence that he's determined to enter Blandings in yet another imposture. Add a gaggle of fearsome aunts, uncles and millionaires, mix in Freddie Threepwood, Beach the Butler and the gardener McAllister, and the moon is full indeed.	272	1947	Clarence Threepwood, Sebastian Beach, Galahad Threepwood, Freddie Threepwood, Angus McAllister, Empress of Blandings, Hermione Wedge, Veronica Wedge, Egbert Wedge, Prudence Garland, Tipton Plimsoll, Dora Garland, William Galahad Lister, Edward Jimpson Murgatroyd, Edwin Pott, Charles, Thomas, Berkeley Bagshott, Bellamy, George J.
