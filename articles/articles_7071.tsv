After being left at the altar, Jade Roberts seeks solace at her best friend’s ranch on the Colorado western slope.

Having never fully healed from a horrific childhood trauma, he simply exists, taking from women what is offered and giving nothing in return...until Jade Roberts catapults into his life. She is beautiful, sweet, and giving, and his desire for her becomes a craving he fears he'll never be able to satisfy. Passion sizzles between the two lovers...but long-buried secrets haunt them both and may eventually tear them apart.	288	May 3rd 2016		Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34515463-craving
