The Secret Journals of Adolf Hitler, Volume 1: The Anointed		A.G. Mogan	4.25	162	42	What happenings and environments wrought the most hated man in history? How does a child become a young man who evolved into a self-proclaimed messiah? Why did this one man become a psychotic who was responsible for the deaths of more than 50 million people? This book follows the first, formative years of Adolf Hitlerâ€™s life. Presented as a personal journal, this is a fact-supported re-telling of a desperate existence, as viewed by Hitler, and tracks the points of pain that forged his beliefs. From a childhood of abuse and cheating death to an agonizing unrequited love to torturous years as a beggar in Vienna to finally finding his destiny. Enflamed by delusions, Hitler embraced the powers he believed guided his life. This is a story of dire happenstances that broke a mind and spirit, created beliefs that twisted innocence, ultimately morphing into a malicious brew that changed the world forever. This is the one story that's never been told.	384	September 19th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39279312-the-secret-journals-of-adolf-hitler-volume-1
