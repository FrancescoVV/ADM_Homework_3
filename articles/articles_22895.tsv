Cards of Love: Three of Swords		Willow Winters	4.22	475	199	From USA Today bestselling author, Willow Winters, comes a seductive and emotionally captivating, second chance romance. It’s impossible to get over what we had. He was everything – irresistibly handsome, ruthlessly elite, and seemingly untouchable - while I was nothing. Yet he protected me when I was at my lowest; more than that, he wanted me. He devoured me… and I did the same to him. Until it all fell apart and I ran as far away from Madox as I could. After all, the two of us were never meant to be together. I never thought I’d see him again, years later. Let alone be under him in the way I’ve craved since we said goodbye. The attraction between us still burns like fire, but time can’t change the past. And I don’t know if it’s possible for us to mend all of our broken pieces.	156	December 3rd 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43127287-cards-of-love
