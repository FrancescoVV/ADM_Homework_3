Quicksilver	Hungry Moon #1	Claudy Conn	3.68	1195	104	Ravena MacAllister doesn’t want to admit what she is. She wants to continue pretending she’s just human … only human, like her mother, like her friends. But she isn’t human. Heartbreak and betrayal send her off rushing to Scotland, to a familiar haven where she has spent so many summers with her father, but she soon discovers that everything has changed. From the moment she meets Quinn MacValdane, shock waves travel through him to her and back again, wrapping them in a tide of passion she had never dreamt possible. But if they are to have a future together, she must confront who and what she is, for she will need to call on the powers within her as she becomes embroiled in an adventure that will alter her life forever. The time for pretending is over.	270	November 21st 2012	Quinn MacValdane, Whelan MacPoole, Ravena MacAllister		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16168599-quicksilver
