The Gathering	Darkness Rising #1	Kelley Armstrong	4.01	59555	3399	Sixteen-year-old Maya is just an ordinary teen in an ordinary town. Sure, she doesn't know much about her background - the only thing she really has to cling to is an odd paw-print birthmark on her hip - but she never really put much thought into who her parents were or how she ended up with her adopted parents in this tiny medical-research community on Vancouver Island. Until now . Strange things have been happening in this claustrophobic town - from the mountain lions that have been approaching Maya to her best friend's hidden talent for "feeling" out people and situations, to the sexy new bad boy who makes Maya feel... different . Combine that with a few unexplained deaths and a mystery involving Maya's biological parents and it's easy to suspect that this town might have more than its share of skeletons in its closet.	359	April 12th 2011	Maya Delaney, Daniel Bianchi, Serena, Rafael "Rafe" Martinez, Nicole Tillson, Sam Russo, Corey Carling, Hayley Morris, Annie Martinez	Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7896345-the-gathering
