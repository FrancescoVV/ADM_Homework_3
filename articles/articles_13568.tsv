Rashed, My Friend		Muhammed Zafar Iqbal, Yeshim Iqbal	4.54	1962	62	1971 was a turning point in the sub-continent's history: it was when everything changed and Bangladesh came into existence. For nine months from March to December, the people of the country sacrificed their lives and all else that they had for their freedom in a way never before seen in the history of the world. This is the story of the Liberation War of Bangladesh, seen through the eyes of a child. A story of friendship. A story of sacrifice. A story of courage. A story of freedom. [This is the English translation of "Amar Bondhu Rashed" done by the author, Muhammed Zafar Iqbal's daughter Yeshim Iqbal.]	128	February 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4785973-rashed-my-friend
