The Greater Number		Paul Loh	4.75	4	1	Zombies are running rampant all over the world. They've been reduced to their basest instincts and can tell the living from the dead by the smell of fear. They behave like animals with a pack mentality. A man who thinks he has been chosen by fate to lead them has no fear. He believes he is the Hand of Karma, sent to rid the world of humanity's evil. Can anyone stop him?	56	July 10th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17662594-the-greater-number
