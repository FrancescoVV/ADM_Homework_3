The Snowman		Raymond Briggs	4.24	16749	617	Illustrated in full color, this is a wordless story. The pictures have "the hazy softness of air in snow." A little boy rushes out into the wintry day to build a snowman, which comes alive in his dreams that night. The boy invites him home and in return is taken on a flight high above the countryside.	32	November 12th 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/489972.The_Snowman
