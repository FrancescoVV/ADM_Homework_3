Still Life with Woodpecker		Tom Robbins	4.03	74086	2811	Still Life with Woodpecker is a sort of a love story that takes place inside a pack of Camel cigarettes. It reveals the purpose of the moon, explains the difference between criminals and outlaws, examines the conflict between social activism and romantic individualism, and paints a portrait of contemporary society that includes powerful Arabs, exiled royalty, and pregnant cheerleaders. It also deals with the problem of redheads.	288	October 1980		Hawaii (United States), Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9566.Still_Life_with_Woodpecker
