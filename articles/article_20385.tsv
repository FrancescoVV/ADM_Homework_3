Fast Times at Ridgemont High		Cameron Crowe	3.97	736	86	This is a true story. In the fall of 1979 Cameron Crowe at 22 years of age walked into the office of Principal William Gray's office and asked permission to attend classes for the full length of the school year to research a book he was to write of his experiences inside the walls of Ridgemont High and Redondo Beach, California. This is the day-by-day journal of horny and wasted semi-blank adults who don't know a thing about their future.	253	September 1981			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272716.Fast_Times_at_Ridgemont_High
