Spellsinger	Spellsinger #1	Alan Dean Foster	3.86	6559	199	Among sentient animals and humans, hardheaded and hard-shelled wizard Clothahump searches across dimensions for a wizard to defeat looming armies of Plated Folk. Jonathan-Thomas Meriweather, part-time wannabe rock guitarist and janitor, makes magic to his well-worn rock repertoire on his duar instrument. While lyrics may be righteous, the magic is too often something else.	352	March 1st 1983	Jonathan Thomas Meriweather, Clothahump, Mudge, Talea		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126503.Spellsinger
