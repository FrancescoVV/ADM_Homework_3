The Red Knight	The Traitor Son Cycle #1	Miles  Cameron	4.11	15087	1094	Twenty eight florins a month is a huge price to pay, for a man to stand between you and the Wild. Twenty eight florins a month is nowhere near enough when a wyvern's jaws snap shut on your helmet in the hot stink of battle, and the beast starts to rip the head from your shoulders. But if standing and fighting is hard, leading a company of men - or worse, a company of mercenaries - against the smart, deadly creatures of the Wild is even harder. It takes all the advantages of birth, training, and the luck of the devil to do it. The Red Knight has all three, he has youth on his side, and he's determined to turn a profit. So when he hires his company out to protect an Abbess and her nunnery, it's just another job. The abby is rich, the nuns are pretty and the monster preying on them is nothing he can't deal with. Only it's not just a job. It's going to be a war...	650	September 1st 2012	Royal Guard, Alcaeus Comnena, Skinch, black warrior, Gwillam, Allan Pargeter, Sister Hawisia, Bill Fuller, Nat Tyler, Thaddeus Pyel, Lissen Carak, Ser John Crayford, Toby Pardieu, Ser Willem Greville, Gerald Random, Thurkan, Judas Beard, Prudentia, Ser John Poultney, Alan Big Nose, Ser George Brewes, Fran Lanthorn, Nita Qwan, Father Jerome, Gawin Morion, Richard Plangere, Skadai, Sieur de Ruth, Old Bob, Sidhi, Hawthor Veney, Kanny, Walter La Tour, Boglins, Ranald Lachlan, Bill Redmede, Abenacki, Eustachios, Royal Steward, Rebecca Almspend, Sister Amicia, Ian Cowpat, Blessed Virgin, Exrech, Lorica, Gaston d'Eu, Long Paw, Diccon Alweather, Master Pyle, Kaitlin Lanthorn, Ser Knight, Daniel Favor, Edward Despansay, Carlus, Kitty Carter, John le Bailli, Sister Miram, Edard Blodget, Ser Mark Wishart, Albin Plain, Galahad Acon, Ser Tancred, gentles, Skahas Gaho, Jehannes, Ser Milus, Hard Hands, Low Sym, Kill Thorn, Hywel Writhe, Hector Lachlan, Michael Ranulfson, Harold Redmede, shop boy, Ser Driant, Gelfred, Francis Atcourt, Will Flodden, Albinkirk		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13616278-the-red-knight
