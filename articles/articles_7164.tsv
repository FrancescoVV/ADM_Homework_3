Montana Sky		Nora Roberts	4.08	43545	1050	When Jack Mercy died, he left behind a ranch worth nearly twenty million dollars. Now his three daughters—each born of a different mother, and each unknown by the others—are gathered to hear the reading of the will. But the women are shocked to learn that before any of them can inherit, they must live together on the ranch for one year. For Tess, a screenwriter who just wants to collect her cash and get back to Hollywood, it’s a nightmare. For Lily, on the run from her abusive ex-husband, it’s a refuge. And for Willa—who grew up on the ranch—it’s an intrusion into her rightful home.They are sisters…and strangers. Now they face a challenge: to put their bitterness aside and live like a family. To protect each other from danger—and unite against a brutal enemy who threatens to destroy them all…	438	March 12th 1996	Willa Mercy, Ben McKinnon, Lily Mercy, Adam Wolfchild, Tess Mercy, Nathan Torrence	Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114144.Montana_Sky
