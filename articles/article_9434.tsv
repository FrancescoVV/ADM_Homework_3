The Rake	Lessons in Love #1	Suzanne Enoch	3.86	7693	369	Three determined young ladies vow to give three of London's worst rakes their comeuppance ― but when these rogues turn the tables, who truly learns a lesson in love? Once upon a time, the notorious Viscount Dare charmed Lady Georgiana Halley out of her innocence ― to win a wager, no less! ― and now he must pay dearly. The plan is simple: She will use every seductive wile she knows to win Dare's heart...and then break it. But his smoldering gaze once again tempts Georgiana to give in to desire ― and when he astonishes her with a marriage proposal, she wonders: Is he playing yet another game...or could it truly be love this time?	375	June 4th 2002	Greydon Brakenridge, Duke of Wycliffe, Georgina Halley, Tristan Carroway		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823583.The_Rake
