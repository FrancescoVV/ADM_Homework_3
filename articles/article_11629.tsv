Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment		Martin E.P. Seligman	3.95	9850	411	A national bestseller, Authentic Happiness launched the revolutionary new science of Positive Psychology—and sparked a coast-to-coast debate on the nature of real happiness. According to esteemed psychologist and bestselling author Martin Seligman, happiness is not the result of good genes or luck. Real, lasting happiness comes from focusing on one’s personal strengths rather than weaknesses—and working with them to improve all aspects of one’s life. Using practical exercises, brief tests, and a dynamic website program, Seligman shows readers how to identify their highest virtues and use them in ways they haven’t yet considered. Accessible and proven, Authentic Happiness is the most powerful work of popular psychology in years.	336	August 27th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28012.Authentic_Happiness
