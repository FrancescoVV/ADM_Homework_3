That, Which Clouds the Soul		Nicolas Ryan Moore	4.50	26	1	The Pious Commonwealth rules within the walls of The City. All is well for those who abide by their rules and laws. Those who donâ€™t, have much to fear, however. Not only will they have to answer to The Pious Commonwealth, but they will have to answer to The Holy Being, above them. That fear keeps them in line. That fear runs The City. In Nicolas Ryan Moore's debut novella, we follow a man and a woman as they are paired together in a controlled society and attempt to get by, day-to-day, only to start seeing that perhaps there are cracks in the world they live in.	120	April 17th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34813838-that-which-clouds-the-soul
