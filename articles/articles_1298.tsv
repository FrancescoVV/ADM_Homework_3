The Cuckoo's Calling	Cormoran Strike #1	Robert Galbraith	3.87	484582	33402	After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.	456	April 18th 2013	Cormoran Strike, Robin Ellacott, Matthew Cunliffe, Lula Landry, John Bristow, Tony Landry, Lady Yvette Landry Bristow, Sir Alec Bristow, Evan Duffield, Freddy Bestigui, Marlene Higson, Jonny Rokeby, Charlotte Campbell, Leda Strike, Eric Wardle, Graham "Hardy" Hardacre, Linda Ellacott, Detective Inspector Roy Carver	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16160797-the-cuckoo-s-calling
