Roughing It		Mark Twain, Henry B. Wonham	3.89	7938	739	Though known throughout the world for his fictional novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain was also a skilled chronicler of his own life and experiences. In his youth, Twain traveled extensively throughout the untamed American West with his brother, working his way from town to town in a variety of jobs, including gold prospector, reporter, and lecturer. Roughing It is Twain's personal recollection of his wanderlust years. It is a wildly humorous adventure yarn that combines hard facts with a healthy dose of the author's unique perspective, one that helped define the course of American literature.	560	February 1872	Samuel "Mark Twain" Clemens, Mr. Higbie, Jules Beni, Mr. Ballou, Young Claggett <sic>, Oliphant, Col.
