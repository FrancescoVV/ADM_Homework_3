The Day of the Scorpion	The Raj Quartet #2	Paul Scott	4.30	1417	107	In "The Day of the Scorpion," Scott draws us deeper in to his epic of India at the close of World War II. With force and subtlety, he recreates both private ambition and perversity, and the politics of an entire subcontinent at a turning point in history. As the scorpion, encircled by a ring of fire, will sting itself to death, so does the British raj hasten its own destruction when threatened by the flames of Indian independence. Brutal repression and imprisonment of India's leaders cannot still the cry for home rule. And in the midst of chaos, the English Laytons withdraw from a world they no longer know to seek solace in denial, drink, and madness.	493	1968	Hari Kumar, Mohammed Ali Kasim, Mildred Layton, Count Bronowsky, Captain Rowan, Mabel Layton, Barbie Batchelor, Sarah Layton, Susan Layton, Ronald Merrick, Ahmed Kasim, Nigel Rowan	India	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1000718.The_Day_of_the_Scorpion
