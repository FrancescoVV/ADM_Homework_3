Sometimes Never	Sometimes Never #1	Cheryl McIntyre	3.93	17228	788	Hope didn't have the best role model when it came to relationships. She’s content with her current no-strings-attached extracurricular activity with the lead singer of her band. She’s never believed in love and commitment. Mason starts his eighth school in five years anticipating nothing more than the usual—boring classes, fighting more than making friends, and girls happily willing to succumb to his easy smile. He’s never put much stock into love at first sight—until he sees her. Regardless of their painful pasts, Hope and Mason discover that sometimes never can become forever. *This is a mature young adult. Recommended for 17+ due to sensitive subject material, harsh language, and sexual situations.	482	December 18th 2012	Mason Patel, Hope Love, Park Reed		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16762211-sometimes-never
