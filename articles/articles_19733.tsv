Tituba		William Miller, Leonard Jenkins	3.57	49	2	In the winter of 1692, trouble erupted in Salem Village. The fits and dreams of two young girls set off a witch-hunt. More than eighty villagers found themselves charged with witchcraft; twenty-five lost their lives. At the center of the storm stood Tituba, a West Indian slave who was among the first accused. This is the story of her struggle and the profound questions she confronted: Was her folk wisdom really witchcraft? Would she have to offer a false confession to save her life? And where, amid so much anger and turmoil, could she turn for hope and strength?	32	October 15th 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256390.Tituba
