Auvreria		Viktoriya Molchanova	3.78	18	11	Nicole is just your average teen. That is, until extraordinary events start happening. Her adventures take her to the center of the universe and the outer limits of her own potential, and along the way she discovers that not only is life full of excitement and possibility, but people are capable of things far beyond their wildest dreams. Auvreria is a dizzying ride through space, time, and fantastic realms, an education in magic, and a story of two sisters who save the universe by looking out for each other.	145	January 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20633591-auvreria
