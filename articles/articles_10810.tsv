The Anonymous Man	The Anonymous Man #1	Vincent L. Scarsella	3.82	411	26	What if one day you could become anonymous, free of obligations, free to do what you have always wanted to do? That's exactly what Jerry Shaw pulls off after faking his death to collect on a $4 million life insurance policy. But just when Jerry thinks he has escaped his former life, he is betrayed by his co-conspirators, his wife and best friend, and learns that a tenacious insurance company investigator is hot on his heels. You won't be able to put down this twisting and suspenseful novel, wondering if Jerry will ultimately get to do what he has always wanted, to become anonymous, just like the hero of his comic book creation, The Anonymous Man, and then not only draw his further adventures, but live them.
