Perfect	Flawed #2	Cecelia Ahern	4.22	14346	1562	Celestine North is Flawed. Ever since Judge Crevan declared her the number one threat to the public, she has been a ghost, on the run with Carrick, the only person she can trust. But Celestine has a secretâ€”one that could bring the entire Flawed system crumbling to the ground. A secret that has already caused countless people to go missing. Judge Crevan is gaining the upper hand, and time is running out for Celestine. With tensions building, Celestine must make a choice: save just herself or risk her life to save all Flawed people.	341	April 4th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28116714-perfect
