A Demon Bound	Imp #1	Debra Dunbar	3.94	7069	575	Samantha Martin is an imp, enjoying an extended vacation from Hel. All she wants to do is drink beer by the pool, play mischievous pranks on the humans, and get her hot neighbor in the sack. It’s a relaxing break from her infernal home, as long as she manages to avoid the angels, who won’t hesitate to execute her on sight. But when her naughty hellhound lands her in trouble with the local werewolf pack, Sam is blackmailed into helping track and catch a killer. The steps she must take to appease the werewolves will put her right in the crosshairs of the angels. And with angels, there is no second chance.	291	July 17th 2012	Samantha Martin	Maryland (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17979809-a-demon-bound
