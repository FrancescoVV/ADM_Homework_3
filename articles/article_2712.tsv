Prozac Nation		Elizabeth Wurtzel	3.60	54904	1889	A harrowing story of breakdowns, suicide attempts, drug therapy, and an eventual journey back to living, this poignant and often hilarious book gives voice to the high incidence of depression among America's youth. A collective cry for help from a generation who have come of age entrenched in the culture of divorce, economic instability, and AIDS, here is the intensely personal story of a young girl full of promise, whose mood swings have risen and fallen like the lines of a sad ballad.	368	1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227603.Prozac_Nation
