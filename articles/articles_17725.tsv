CRAPLET The Abbreviated Tales of S.R. Tooms		Stacy Macy	4.67	3	0	You have stumbled upon A Child's Heart... a book of short, entirely spooky and at times gutbustingly amusing stories. Each entry ranges in length from a single paragraph up to several pages of nonstop thrilling entertainment. S.R. Tooms himself has assured each tale is certain to titillate, offend, or disgust. A masterful collection of flash fiction running the gamut of human emotion, where only one thing is certain: You will be unable to put this book down once the cover has been lifted... and you'll never forget the narratives within once it closes. To say nothing of the nightmares that will undoubtedly befall you...	87	November 27th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22403786-a-child-s-heart
