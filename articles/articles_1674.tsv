Tales of the City	Tales of the City #1	Armistead Maupin	4.03	37189	2757	San Francisco, 1976. A naïve young secretary, fresh out of Cleveland, tumbles headlong into a brave new world of laundromat Lotharios, pot-growing landladies, cut throat debutantes, and Jockey Shorts dance contests. The saga that ensues is manic, romantic, tawdry, touching, and outrageous—unmistakably the handiwork of Armistead Maupin.	272	1978	Mary Ann Singleton, Michael Tolliver, Anna Madrigal, Mona Ramsey, Brian Hawkins	San Francisco, California (United States), California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16255.Tales_of_the_City
