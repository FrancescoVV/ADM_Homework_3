Lawyers Gone Bad	Lawyers Gone Bad #1	Vincent L. Scarsella	3.72	348	24	“Lawyers Gone Bad,” is the story of beleaguered attorney disciplinary counsel, Dean Alessi, and his trusty investigator, Stu Foley, in their fight against lawyers gone bad – that is lawyers who commit ethical and criminal wrongs, in this case, the local District Attorney who may have committed the ultimate ethical wrong - murder. Novelist Vince Scarsella draws on his real life experiences of over 18 years as head of the Eighth Judicial District Grievance Committee in Buffalo, New York to craft a gripping, suspenseful novel about lawyers gone bad. But the story is more than a crime novel. It concerns friendship, loss, unrequited love, and ultimately, justice. And it also seeks to answer the question, does what goes around, come around?	308	November 11th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29360307-lawyers-gone-bad
