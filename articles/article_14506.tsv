The Queen Is Dead	The Immortal Empire #2	Kate Locke	4.10	3032	296	Nothing lasts forever---and immortality isn't all its cracked up to be. When her brother Val gets in over his head in an investigation of Half-Blood disappearances and goes missing himself, it's up to Xandra, newly crowned Goblin Queen, to get him back and bring the atrocities to light. Xandra must frequent the seediest parts of London, while also coping with what she is, the political factions vying for her favor, and the all too-close scrutiny of Queen Victoria, who wants her head. Add this to being a suspect in a murder investigation, a werewolf boyfriend with demands of his own, and a mother hell bent on destroying the monarchy, and Xandra barely knows which way is up. One thing she does know is that she's already lost one sibling, she's not about to lose another.	333	February 5th 2013		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14781171-the-queen-is-dead
