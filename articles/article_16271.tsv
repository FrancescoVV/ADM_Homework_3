The Clocks	Hercule Poirot #37	Agatha Christie, Robin  Bailey	3.74	24784	1214	Sheila Webb, typist-for-hire, has arrived at 19 Wilbraham Crescent in the seaside town of Crowdean to accept a new job. What she finds is a well-dressed corpse surrounded by five clocks. Mrs. Pebmarsh, the blind owner of No. 19, denies all knowledge of ringing Sheila's secretarial agency and asking for her by name -- yet someone did. Nor does she own that many clocks. And neither woman seems to know the victim. Colin Lamb, a young intelligence specialist working a case of his own at the nearby naval yard, happens to be on the scene at the time of Sheila Webb's ghastly discovery. Lamb knows of only one man who can properly investigate a crime as bizarre and baffling as what happened inside No. 19 -- his friend and mentor, Hercule Poirot.	8	November 7th 1963	Sheila Webb, Inspector Hardcastle, Colin Lamb, Millicent Pebmarsh, Edna Brent, Melvina Rival, Geraldine Brown, Miss Martindale, Hercule Poirot	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/388018.The_Clocks
