Death at La Fenice	Commissario Brunetti #1	Donna Leon	3.85	24614	2180	There is little violent crime in Venice, a serenely beautiful floating city of mystery and magic, history and decay. But the evil that does occasionally rear its head is the jurisdiction of Guido Brunetti, the suave, urbane vice-commissario of police and a genius at detection. Now all of his admirable abilities must come into play in the deadly affair of Maestro Helmut Wellauer, a world-renowned conductor who died painfully from cyanide poisoning during an intermission at La Fenice. But as the investigation unfolds, a chilling picture slowly begins to take shape--a detailed portrait of revenge painted with vivid strokes of hatred and shocking depravity. And the dilemma for Guido Brunetti will not be finding a murder suspect, but rather narrowing the choices down to one. . . .	270	June 19th 1992	Commissario Guido Brunetti, Paola Brunetti, Helmut Wellauer, Deputy police chiefs Vice-Questore Patta, Flavia Petrelli, Chiara Brunetti	Venice (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68099.Death_at_La_Fenice
