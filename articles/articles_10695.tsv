Beauty and the Beastly Earl	A Fairytale Retelling #2	Regina James	4.26	62	7	Without a dowry, Lady Jane knew not to count on her looks to land her a husband. When her mother summons her back to London and she receives a proposition from an Earl she’s never met, she wonders what sort of man would send someone to propose on his behalf? What sort of man would marry a woman he’s never met before? With little options, she agrees she will at least meet the Earl, but nothing could prepare her for the surprise in store for her… Lord Edward had no need for a wife and is only searching for a one because of the ridiculous clause his father left in his will. Adamant that his marriage would be in name only, he sends his best friend to find him the most unmarriageable woman in all of London. Certainly the beauty his friend brings to his country estate could not fit this description. Edward must get rid of her and fast…before he falls in love with a beauty who could never return the affections of a beastly earl.	103	September 11th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41829493-beauty-and-the-beastly-earl
