Happy Again	This Is What Happy Looks Like #1.5	Jennifer E. Smith	3.92	4227	630	Ellie O'Neill and Graham Larkin fell hard for each other when a misspelled email address unexpectedly brought them together. Now, over a year has passed since they said goodbye with the promise to stay in touch, and their daily emails have dwindled to nothing. Ellie is a freshman in college and has told herself to move on, and Graham has kept himself busy starring in more movies, as well as a few tabloid columns. But fate brought these two together once beforeâ€”and it isn't done with them yet. In this sequel novella to This Is What Happy Looks Like , Jennifer E. Smith revisits two beloved characters to tell the story of one magical night in Manhattan. When Ellie and Graham come face to face once more, can they get past the months of silence and the hurt feelings to find their happily-ever-after again?	84	April 14th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25116648-happy-again
