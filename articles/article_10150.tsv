The Thurber Carnival		James Thurber, Michael J. Rosen	4.23	2937	181	"An authentic American genius. . . . Mr. Thurber belongs in the great lines of American humorists that includes Mark Twain and Ring Lardner." --Philadelphia Inquirer James Thurber’s unique ability to convey the vagaries of life in a funny, witty, and often satirical way earned him accolades as one of the finest humorists of the twentieth century. A bestseller upon its initial publication in 1945, The Thurber Carnival captures the depth of his talent and the breadth of his wit. The stories compiled here, almost all of which first appeared in The New Yorker, are from his uproarious and candid collection My World and Welcome to It --including the American classic "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"--as well as from The Owl in the Attic , The Seal in the Bathroom , Men, Women and Dogs . Thurber’s take on life, society, and human nature is timeless and will continue to delight readers even as they recognize a bit of themselves in his brilliant sketches.	425	1945		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72996.The_Thurber_Carnival
