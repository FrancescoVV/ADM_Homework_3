A Rose for Virtue		Norah Lofts	3.69	180	17	Hortense Beauharnais finds herself rubbing shoulders with royalty as her mother remarries to become Napoleon Bonaparte's wife. As Napoleon struggles for power on the battlefields of Europe, so Hortense charts her way through the French court -- a chessboard world where the motives are jealousy and greed and the prizes are thrones of conquered countries. Despite attempts to retain her individuality, Hortense finds herself married to Napoleon's brother Louis, but her heart is with Charles de Flahaut, a gallant young officer. Unwilling to cross her stepfather, Hortense must wait and see if time will take her to her lover.		1971	Hortense de Beauharnais		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1034995.A_Rose_for_Virtue
