Dark Triumph	His Fair Assassin #2	Robin LaFevers	4.13	38973	3584	I lean forward, pushing my body out past the battlements. The wind plucks at my cloak, buffets against me, as if it would carry me off in flight, just like the birds or the knight's soul. Let go, it cries, I will take you far, far away. I want to laugh at the exhilarating feeling, I will catch you, it whistles seductively. The convent has returned Sybella to a life that nearly drove her mad. Her father's rage and brutality are terrifying, and her brother's love is equally monstrous. When she discovers an unexpected ally imprisoned in the dungeons, will a a daughter of Death find something other than vengeance to live for?	387	April 2nd 2013	Ismae Rienne, Gavriel Duval, Sybella d'Albret, Benebic de Waroch		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9943270-dark-triumph
