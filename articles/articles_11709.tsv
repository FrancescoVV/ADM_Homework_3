The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements		Eric Hoffer	4.22	7692	1181	A stevedore on the San Francisco docks in the 1940s, Eric Hoffer wrote philosophical treatises in his spare time while living in the railroad yards. The True Believer -- the first and most famous of his books -- was made into a bestseller when President Eisenhower cited it during one of the earliest television press conferences. Completely relevant and essential for understanding the world today, The True Believer is a visionary, highly provocative look into the mind of the fanatic and a penetrating study of how an individual becomes one.	177	1951			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15916.The_True_Believer
