Another Country		James Baldwin	4.29	15997	1499	Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Set in Greenwich Village, Harlem, and France, among other locales, Another Country is a novel of passions--sexual, racial, political, artistic--that is stunning for its emotional intensity and haunting sensuality, depicting men and women, blacks and whites, stripped of their masks of gender and race by love and hatred at the most elemental and sublime. In a small set of friends, Baldwin imbues the best and worst intentions of liberal America in the early 1970s.	448	May 1962			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38474.Another_Country
