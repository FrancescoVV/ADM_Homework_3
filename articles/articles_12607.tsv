The Vintner's Luck	Vintner's Luck #1	Elizabeth Knox	3.87	2989	393	One summer night in 1808, Sobran Jodeau sets out to drown his love sorrows in his family's vineyard when he stumbles on an angel. Once he gets over his shock, Sobran decides that Xas, the male angel, is his guardian sent to counsel him on everything from marriage to wine production. But Xas turns out to be a far more mysterious character. Compelling and erotic, The Vintner's Luck explores a decidedly unorthodox love story as Sobran eventually comes to love and be loved by both Xas and the young Countess de Valday, his friend and employer at the neighboring chateau.	284	1998		Burgundy Region (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157387.The_Vintner_s_Luck
