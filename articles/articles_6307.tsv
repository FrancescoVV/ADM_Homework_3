Storm of Steel		Ernst Jünger, Michael Hofmann	4.14	9989	793	A memoir of astonishing power, savagery, and ashen lyricism, 'Storm of Steel' illuminates not only the horrors but also the fascination of total war, seen through the eyes of an ordinary German soldier. Young, tough, patriotic, but also disturbingly self-aware, Jünger exulted in the Great War, which he saw not just as a great national conflict, but more importantly as a unique personal struggle. Leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart, Jünger kept testing himself, braced for the death that will mark his failure. Published shortly after the war's end, 'Storm of Steel' was a worldwide bestseller and can now be rediscovered through Michael Hofmann's brilliant new translation.	289	1920	Ernst Jünger	Ieper (Belgium), Champagne (France), Les Éparges (France), Arras , 1916 (France) Combles , 1916 (France) Cambrai , 1917 (France) World War I (WW I) Western Front, Arras (France), Combles (France), Cambrai (France), World War I (WW I), Western Front	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240485.Storm_of_Steel
