Devil's Cub	Alastair-Audley Tetralogy #2	Georgette Heyer	4.21	13461	1048	Duellist and gamester, the young Marquis of Vidal had fairly earned the sobriquet 'Devil's Cub' - a tribute to the wilder excesses of his father, the Duke of Avon. When Mary Challoner discovered Dominic's plans to run away with her lovely sister, she donned cloak and mask in a daring impersonation and found herself bound for France with the most notorious rake in Georgian London. The many admirers of These Old Shades will meet some familiar friends!	288	1932	Mary Challoner, Dominic Alistair, Marquis of Vidal		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311308.Devil_s_Cub
