Angels Flight	Harry Bosch #6	Michael Connelly	4.18	47197	1877	An activist attorney is killed in a cute little L.A. trolley called Angels Flight, far from Harry Bosch's Hollywood turf. But the case is so explosive--and the dead man's enemies inside the L.A.P.D. are so numerous--that it falls to Harry to solve it. Now the streets are superheating. Harry's year-old Vegas marriage is unraveling. And the hunt for a killer is leading Harry to another high-profile L.A. murder case, one where every cop had a motive. The question is, did any have the guts?	454	January 28th 1999	Hieronymus "Harry" Bosch, Eleanor Wish, Roy Lindell, Kizmin "Kiz" Rider, Jerry Edgar, Irvin Irving, Francis "Frankie" Sheehan, John Chastain, John Garwood, Howard Elias, Carla Entrenkin, Janis Langwiser	Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32502.Angels_Flight
