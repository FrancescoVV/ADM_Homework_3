The Crime Wave at Blandings		P.G. Wodehouse	4.30	299	21	One of P.G. Wodehouse's most gloriously funny stories, this is the tale of bumbling Lord Emsworth, whose quiet life reading "The Care Of The Pig" and pottering among the flowers at Blandings Castle is shattered by an outbreak of lawlessness involving his niece Jane (the third prettiest girl in Shropshire), an airgun - and the trouser seat of the abominable Baxter.	96	October 17th 1936			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10533446-the-crime-wave-at-blandings
