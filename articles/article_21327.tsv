Fastest in the West		Anfaney Gladwin	4.58	38	3	They say crime doesn’t pay, but some people in the west set out to prove that wrong, the outlaws. Roy wasn’t one of those men. He took it upon himself personally to prove those murderous fugitives wrong, and he was there to collect his payments. And being the fastest draw in the west he never had much trouble. That was until he met up with the heartless killer Diamondback and his ruthless gang.	78	January 1st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43235179-fastest-in-the-west
