Always and Forever, Lara Jean	To All the Boys I've Loved Before #3	Jenny Han	4.12	149076	17005	Lara Jean is having the best senior year. And there’s still so much to look forward to: a class trip to New York City, prom with her boyfriend Peter, Beach Week after graduation, and her dad’s wedding to Ms. Rothschild. Then she’ll be off to college with Peter, at a school close enough for her to come home and bake chocolate chip cookies on the weekends. Life couldn’t be more perfect! At least, that’s what Lara Jean thinks . . . until she gets some unexpected news. Now the girl who dreads change must rethink all her plans—but when your heart and your head are saying two different things, which one should you listen to?	325	May 2nd 2017		Charlottesville, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35247769-always-and-forever-lara-jean
