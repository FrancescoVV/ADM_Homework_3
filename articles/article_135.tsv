The Count of Monte Cristo		Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss	4.25	749341	21411	Thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantes is confined to the grim fortress of If. There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the Isle of Monte Cristo and he becomes determined not only to escape, but also to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. Dumas’ epic tale of suffering and retribution, inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment, was a huge popular success when it was first serialized in the 1840s. Robin Buss’s lively English translation is complete and unabridged, and remains faithful to the style of Dumas’s original. This edition includes an introduction, explanatory notes and suggestions for further reading.	1276	1844	Edmond Dantès, Abbé Faria, Giovanni Bertuccio, Luigi Vampa, Haydée, Mercédès Mondego, Fernand Mondego, Albert de Morcerf, Baron Danglars, Gérard de Villefort, Valentine de Villefort, Noirtier de Villefort, Héloïse de Villefort, Pierre Morrel, Maximilien Morrel, Beauchamp, Franz d'Épinay, Lucien Debray, Eugénie Danglars, Hermine Danglars, Benedetto, Kadrus (tailor,neighboring)	Marseille (Marseilles) (France), Montecristo (Italy), Montecristo , 1838 (Italy) Rome , 1838 (Italy) Paris , 1840 (France) France, Rome (Italy), Paris (France), France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo
