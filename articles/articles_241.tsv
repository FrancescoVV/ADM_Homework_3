Uglies	Uglies  #1	Scott Westerfeld	3.86	562680	23631	Tally is about to turn sixteen, and she can't wait. In just a few weeks she'll have the operation that will turn her from a repellent ugly into a stunning pretty. And as a pretty, she'll be catapulted into a high-tech paradise where her only job is to have fun. But Tally's new friend Shay isn't sure she wants to become a pretty. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty worldâ€”and it isn't very pretty. The authorities offer Tally a choice: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. Tally's choice will change her world forever....	425	February 8th 2005	David Strorm, Tally Youngblood, Shay, Peris, Dr. Cable		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24770.Uglies
