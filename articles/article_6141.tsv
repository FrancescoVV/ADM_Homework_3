Thoughtful	Thoughtless #1.5	S.C. Stephens	4.23	16185	1870	Every story has two sides, and in this new book, the epic love story between Kiera and Kellan is shown through his eyes. All Kellan Kyle needs is his guitar, and some clean sheets of paper. Growing up in a house that was far from a home, he learned a hard lesson: You're worthless . Now his life is comfortably filled with passionate music, loyal band mates, and fast women... until he meets her. Kiera makes him ache for more. Makes him feel for the first time that he's worth more. But there's one problemâ€” she's his best friend's girl. Just when Kellan thought his emotional defenses were rock solid, Kiera's indecisive heart wreaks havoc on his soul, changing him forever. Losing Kiera is not an option.	560	February 24th 2015	Kellan Kyle, Denny Harris, Kiera Allen		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23200620-thoughtful
