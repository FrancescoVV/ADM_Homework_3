The Mighty Miss Malone		Christopher Paul Curtis	4.11	14306	1312	“We are a family on a journey to a place called wonderful” is the motto of Deza Malone’s family. Deza is the smartest girl in her class in Gary, Indiana, singled out by teachers for a special path in life. But the Great Depression hit Gary hard, and there are no jobs for black men. When her beloved father leaves to find work, Deza, Mother, and her older brother Jimmie go in search of him, and end up in a Hooverville outside Flint, Michigan. Jimmie’s beautiful voice inspires him to leave the camp to be a performer, while Deza and Mother find a new home, and cling to the hope that they will find Father. The twists and turns of their story reveal the devastation of the Depression and prove that Deza truly is the Mighty Miss Malone.	320	January 10th 2012		Indiana (United States), Michigan (United States), Flint, Michigan (United States), Gary, Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11288619-the-mighty-miss-malone
