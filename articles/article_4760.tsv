Chasing the Prophecy	Beyonders #3	Brandon Mull	4.37	18080	1223	Jason and Rachel were not born in Lyrian. They did not grow up in Lyrian. But after all of the battles and losses, the triumphs and adventures, and most of all, the friendships forged in this fantastical world, Lyrian has become home to them in a way they never could have imagined. And so, armed now with the prophecy of a dying oracle, they have gone on their separate quests—each surrounded by brave and powerful allies—knowing that the chance for success is slim. But Jason and Rachel are ready at last to become the heroes Lyrian needs, no matter the cost.	512	March 12th 2013	Maldor, Rachel Woodford, Jason Walker, Galloran	Lyrian	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801381-chasing-the-prophecy
