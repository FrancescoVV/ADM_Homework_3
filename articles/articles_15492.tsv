Most nights, he beams down at the children of Earth, providing them with an inextinguishable nightlight that keeps nightmares at bay. But what happens when it's foggy or cloudy? When the moon is less than full and bright? Who will keep the children safe at night? He needs a helper! And he's spied just the fellow: a sleepy little guy named Sanderson Mansnoozie (Sandy, for short), who might be perfect...if only the Man in the Moon can get him to wake up.	44	October 2nd 2012	Sanderson Mansnoozie, Pitch the Nightmare King, Man in the Moon		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13547099-the-sandman
