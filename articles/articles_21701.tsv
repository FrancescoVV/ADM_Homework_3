The Adventures Of Dr. McNinja	Adventures of Dr. McNinja, Volume I #1	Christopher Hastings	4.28	230	16	This 126 page book collects "Meet the Doctor and His Friendly Staff", "So What Is a McNinja", and "There Is a Raptor In My Office" all together in one volume. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! There are also the first five .Net Magazine Dr. McNinja comics, previously unavailable outside of the UK. It's got the 2005 April Fools Day comic, and a page with some sketches and other interesting/embarrassing goodies. Last, but not least, all the alt-text has been preserved in the printing, with brand new commentary added for Meet the Doctor and His Friendly Staff.	64	June 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5116791-the-adventures-of-dr-mcninja
