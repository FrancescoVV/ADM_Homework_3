Bartleby the Scrivener		Herman Melville	3.93	45898	3405	Academics hail it as the beginning of modernism, but to readers around the world—even those daunted by Moby-Dick — Bartleby the Scrivener is simply one of the most absorbing and moving novellas ever. Set in the mid-19th century on New York City's Wall Street, it was also, perhaps, Herman Melville's most prescient story: what if a young man caught up in the rat race of commerce finally just said, "I would prefer not to"? The tale is one of the final works of fiction published by Melville before, slipping into despair over the continuing critical dismissal of his work after Moby-Dick , he abandoned publishing fiction. The work is presented here exactly as it was originally published in Putnam's magazine—to, sadly, critical disdain.	64	December 1853	Bartleby, Ginger Nut, Turkey, Nippers	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114230.Bartleby_the_Scrivener
