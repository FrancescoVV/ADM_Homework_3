Tribulation Force	Left Behind #2	Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins	3.96	37272	1016	In one cataclysmic moment, millions around the globe disappear. Those left behind face war, famine, plagues, and natural disasters so devastating that only one in four people will survive. Odds are even worse for enemies of the Antichrist and his new world order. Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, Bruce Barnes, and Chloe Steele band together to form the Tribulation Force. Their task is clear, and their goal is nothing less than to stand and fight the enemies of God during the seven most chaotic years the planet will ever see.	450	September 27th 1996		United States of America, Chicago, Illinois (United States), New York City, New York (United States), Jerusalem (Israel) Iraq, Jerusalem (Israel), Iraq	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228258.Tribulation_Force
