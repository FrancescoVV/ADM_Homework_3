Touch & Geaux	Cut & Run #7	Abigail Roux	4.50	9400	1244	After having their faces plastered across the news during a high-profile case, FBI Special Agents Ty Grady and Zane Garrett have become more useful to the Bureau posing for photo ops than working undercover. Just as Zane is beginning to consider retirement a viable option, Ty receives a distress call from a friend, leading them to a city rife with echoes from the past. New Orleans wears its history on its streets, and it’s the one place Ty’s face could get him killed. Surrounded by trouble as soon as they land, Ty and Zane are swiftly confronted with a past from which Ty can’t hide—one with a surprising connection to Zane’s. As threats close in from all directions, both men must come to terms with the lives they’ve led and the lies they’ve told. They soon discover that not all their secrets are out yet, and nothing lasts forever.	349	April 8th 2013	Beaumont "Ty" Tyler Grady, Zane Zachary Garrett, Nick O'Flaherty, Liam Bell, Kelly Abbott	Louisiana (United States), Maryland (United States), New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16159276-touch-geaux
