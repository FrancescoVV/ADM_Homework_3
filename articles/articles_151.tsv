Shadow Kiss	Vampire Academy #3	Richelle Mead	4.34	327423	11344	WHAT IF FOLLOWING HER HEART MEANS ROSE COULD LOSE HER BEST FRIEND FOREVER? Lissa Dragomir is a Moroi princess: a mortal vampire with a rare gift for harnessing the earth's magic. She must be protected at all times from Strigoi; the fiercest vampires - the ones who never die. The powerful blend of human and vampire blood that flows through Rose Hathaway, Lissa's best friend, makes her a Dhampir. Rose is dedicated to a dangerous life of protecting Lissa from the Strigoi, who are hell-bent on making Lissa one of them. Rose knows it is forbidden to love another guardian. Her best friend, Lissa - the last Dragomir princess - must always come first. Unfortunately, when it comes to gorgeous Dimitri Belikov, some rules are meant to be broken... Then a strange darkness begins to grow in Rose's mind, and ghostly shadows warn of a terrible evil drawing nearer to the Academy's iron gates. The immortal undead are closing in, and they want vengeance for the lives Rose has stolen. In a heart-stopping battle to rival her worst nightmares, Rose will have to choose between life, love, and the two people who matter most... but will her choice mean that only one can survive?	443	November 13th 2008	Vasilisa "Lissa" Dragomir, Dimitri Belikov, Christian Ozera, Mason Ashford, Adrian Ivashkov, Victor Dashkov, Mia Rinaldi, Janine Hathaway, Jillian Mastrano, Edison "Eddie" Castile, Rosemarie "Rose" Hathaway, Camille Conta, Stan Alto, Jesse Zeklos, Tatiana Ivashkov, Ryan Aylesworth, Shane Reyes, Brandon Lazar, Dean Barnes	Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2802316-shadow-kiss
