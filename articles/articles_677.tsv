The Big Sleep	Philip Marlowe #1	Raymond Chandler	3.99	126799	5722	Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid....He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. This is the Code of the Private Eye as defined by Raymond Chandler in his 1944 essay 'The Simple Act of Murder.' Such a man was Philip Marlowe, private eye, an educated, heroic, streetwise, rugged individualist and the hero of Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep . This work established Chandler as the master of the 'hard-boiled' detective novel, and his articulate and literary style of writing won him a large audience, which ranged from the man in the street to the most sophisticated intellectual.	231	February 6th 1939	Philip Marlowe, Vivian Regan, Carmen Sternwood, General Guy Sternwood, Eddie Mars, Rusty Regan, Arthur Gwynn Geiger, Owen Taylor, Agnes Lozelle, Joe Brody, Harry Jones, Mona Mars, Carol Lundgren, Lash Camino, Bernie Ohls	Los Angeles, California (United States), California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2052.The_Big_Sleep
