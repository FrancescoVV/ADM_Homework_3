The Prestige		Christopher Priest	3.89	17502	1891	In 1878, two young stage magicians clash in the dark during the course of a fraudulent s√©ance. From this moment on, their lives become webs of deceit and revelation as they vie to outwit and expose one another. Their rivalry will take them to the peaks of their careers, but with terrible consequences. In the course of pursuing each other's ruin, they will deploy all the deception their magicians' craft can command--the highest misdirection and the darkest science. Blood will be spilled, but it will not be enough. In the end, their legacy will pass on for generations...to descendants who must, for their sanity's sake, untangle the puzzle left to them.	404	September 1995	Andrew Westley, Kate Angier, Rupert Angier, Alfred Borden, Arthur Koenig, Nikola Tesla		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239239.The_Prestige
