Little Dorrit		Charles Dickens, Stephen J. Wall, Helen Small	3.99	43625	1623	A novel of serendipity, of fortunes won and lost, and of the spectre of imprisonment that hangs over all aspects of Victorian society, Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit is edited with an introduction by Stephen Wall in Penguin Classics. When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad, he takes a kindly interest in Amy Dorrit, his mother's seamstress, and in the affairs of Amy's father, William Dorrit, a man of shabby grandeur, long imprisoned for debt in Marshalsea prison. As Arthur soon discovers, the dark shadow of the prison stretches far beyond its walls to affect the lives of many, from the kindly Mr Panks, the reluctant rent-collector of Bleeding Heart Yard, and the tipsily garrulous Flora Finching, to Merdle, an unscrupulous financier, and the bureaucratic Barnacles in the Circumlocution Office. A masterly evocation of the state and psychology of imprisonment, Little Dorrit is one of the supreme works of Dickens's maturity.	1021	1855	Amy "Little Dorrit" Dorrit, Arthur Clennam, Rigaud "Blandois", William Dorrit, Fanny Dorrit, Mr. Pancks, Mrs. Clennam	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31250.Little_Dorrit
