Accidental Crush	Accidental Crush #1	Adrienne Torrisi	3.80	780	49	Sometimes you think you know exactly what life is going to be like and then something unexpected turns your world upside down. Ashley Taylor is just starting her freshman year of high school. She’s certain this year will be exactly like every other. She'll go unnoticed in the shadow of her older brother, Ryan, because he and his two best friends, Todd and Brian, are juniors as well as stars on the varsity football team. Everyone knows and loves them, while she is only a freshman; a nobody. Ashley has known both of her brother’s best friends her entire life, however, she's never really noticed Todd's clear, blue eyes and perfectly messy hair until now. Unfortunately, he still only sees her as Ryan's kid sister. Not to mention, he's also her best friend's older brother; so she needs to keep her true feelings a secret. As she navigates her own, difficult feelings, Ashley learns that she's not the only one keeping secrets, and if these other secrets get out, they could destroy friendships... maybe even lives.	237	October 5th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18662771-accidental-crush
