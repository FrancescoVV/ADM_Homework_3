Hidden	Otherworld Stories #10.7--in Otherworld Nights	Kelley Armstrong, Angilram	4.30	4319	262	Hiking through the snow, holiday baking and playing board games by the fire – what’s not to love about an old-fashioned family Christmas? Werewolves Elena Michaels and Clayton Danvers want to give their four-year-old twins, Kate and Logan, something their parents never had: a nice, normal holiday. No Pack responsibilities, no homicidal half-demons or power-hungry sorcerers to deal with – just the four of them, alone, at a chalet outside Ontario’s Algonquin Park. Then a strange werewolf shows up at their door…while the town is buzzing about a young man, back from college, found half-eaten in the woods. And there’s the missing little girl … With all the signs pointing to a rogue mutt with a taste for human flesh, Elena and Clay have no choice but to investigate. But are they the hunters – or the hunted?	193	2011	Elena Michaels, Clayton Danvers, Nicholas Sorrentino, Noah Stillwell, Reese Williams		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10853751-hidden
