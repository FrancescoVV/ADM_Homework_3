The Charm School		Nelson DeMille	4.27	33329	1460	Deep in the heart of Russia, a group of casually dressed young men are learning a different kind of lesson. The undergraduates sprawled around a game board aren't chilling out on campus: the young KGB agents attending the Charm School are brushing up on their American. When a young tourist goes to the aid of a stranger on a dark Russian road, he is astonished to find a fellow American on the run. The man has been missing for over a decade, plucked from the jungles of Vietnam to become an unwilling tutor at the institution. Now his former students are poised to strike at the heart of America.	816	April 1st 1988		U.S.S.R., Moscow (Russian Federation), Russia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40606265-the-charm-school
