The Darkness of the Womb		Richard B. Knight	3.71	42	23	Before life and after death, we exist in the Internal Landscape. It is here where the unborn decide if they want to be born or not. It is also here where the deceased battle their past regrets in the form of monsters in order to find peace in the afterlife. It is a violent, horrifying world where one can die a second death and slip into eternal darkness if they let their past regrets defeat them. Enter soon-to-be-mother, Marigold Haunt. She has wanted a child her entire life, and finally gets her wish at the age of 49. But after an accident, Marigold is pronounced brain dead (even though her body still lives). Ending up in the Internal Landscape, Marigold's journey toward fate begins. She is guided by the avatar of Instinct who protects her from the monsters manifested from her past regrets. But when she finds out her unborn child doesn’t want to be born, she decides to risk eternal darkness for the small chance of convincing her child to live.	257	June 16th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23269110-the-darkness-of-the-womb
