Fallen	Fallen #1	Lauren Kate	3.73	497227	19769	There’s something achingly familiar about Daniel Grigori. Mysterious and aloof, he captures Luce Price’s attention from the moment she sees him on her first day at the Sword & Cross boarding school in sultry Savannah, Georgia. He’s the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move. Even though Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce—and goes out of his way to make that very clear—she can’t let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, she has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret… even if it kills her.	452	December 8th 2009	Lucinda Price, Daniel Grigori, Cameron "Cam" Briel, Arriane Alter, Pennyweather "Penn" Van Syckle Lockwood, Roland Sparks, Gabrielle 'Gabbe' Givens, Mary Margaret 'Molly' Zane	Savannah, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487308-fallen
