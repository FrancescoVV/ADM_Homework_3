A Ranch Bordering the Salty River		Stephen Page	4.64	14	9	"A unique collection of poems whose main subject is an American managing a large ranch in Argentina. Generally an unsentimental account of chores, local workers and natural wonders, Page presents striking and convincing images and diction. The Wild West is still alive, but it’s in South America.” – Ed Ochester		September 23rd 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32171420-a-ranch-bordering-the-salty-river
