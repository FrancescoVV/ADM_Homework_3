Walking Across Egypt		Clyde Edgerton	3.90	5678	593	She has as much business keeping a stray dog as she would walking across Egypt–which not so incidentally is the title of her favorite hymn. She’s Mattie Rigsbee, an independent, strong-minded senior citizen who, at seventy-eight, might be slowing down just a bit. When teenage delinquent Wesley Benfield drops in on her life, he is even less likely a companion than the stray dog. But, of course, the dog never tasted her mouth-watering pound cake. Wise and witty, down-home and real, Walking Across Egypt is a book for everyone.	215	January 3rd 1987		North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74616.Walking_Across_Egypt
