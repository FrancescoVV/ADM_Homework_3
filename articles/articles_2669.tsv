Montgomery	4.14	85703	2413	Anne's own true love, Gilbert Blythe, is finally a doctor, and in the sunshine of the old orchard, among their dearest friends, they are about to speak their vows. Soon the happy couple will be bound for a new life together and their own dream house, on the misty purple shores of Four Winds Harbor. A new life means fresh problems to solve, fresh surprises. Anne and Gilbert will make new friends and meet their neighbors: Captain Jim, the lighthouse attendant, with his sad stories of the sea; Miss Cornelia Bryant, the lady who speaks from the heartâ€”and speaks her mind; and the tragically beautiful Leslie Moore, into whose dark life Anne shines a brilliant light.	227	1917	Anne Shirley, Gilbert Blythe, James Boyd (Captain Jim), Cornelia (Bryant) Elliott, Leslie Moore, Owen Ford, Marshall Elliot, Susan Baker	Canada	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77394.Anne_s_House_of_Dreams
