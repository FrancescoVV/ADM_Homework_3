Prey		Lurlene McDaniel	3.62	1949	211	A teacher is supposed to impart a love of learning and a thirst for knowledge. It's a bit different with Ms. Lori Settles. All the kids are talking about how hot she is-and she is especially interested in Ryan Piccoli. When she starts giving Ryan extra attention, he's feeling more than happy-at first. He's used to being the class clown, but really he's a loner. One day after school, the friendship with Lori Settles goes farther than he ever expected. She's his teacher. She's at least twice his age. Intimacy with a teacher is wrong, yet it feels so good in every way. Soon, Lori is making demands and Ryan begins to feel overwhelmed, but Ryan refuses to even admit anything is going on. Something immoral is going on and before too long the choices made will change lives forever.	196	February 12th 2008	Lori Settles, Ryan Piccoli, Honey Fowler	Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1036302.Prey
