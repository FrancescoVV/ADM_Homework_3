Frenchman's Creek		Daphne du Maurier, Julie Myerson	3.95	13109	1212	Bored and restless in London's Restoration Court, Lady Dona escapes into the British countryside with her restlessness and thirst for adventure as her only guides. Eventually Dona lands in remote Navron, looking for peace of mind in its solitary woods and hidden creeks. She finds the passion her spirit craves in the love of a daring French pirate who is being hunted by all of Cornwall. Together, they embark upon a quest rife with danger and glory, one which bestows upon Dona the ultimate choice: sacrifice her lover to certain death or risk her own life to save him.	260	September 1941	Dona, Lady St. Columb, Jean-Benoit Aub√©ry	Helford River (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84573.Frenchman_s_Creek
