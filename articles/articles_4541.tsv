Born of Night	The League: Nemesis Rising #1	Sherrilyn Kenyon	4.19	25230	1618	In the Ichidian Universe, The League and their ruthless assassins rule all. Expertly trained and highly valued, the League Assassins are the backbone of the government. But not even the League is immune to corruption . . . Command Assassin Nykyrian Quikiades once turned his back on the League—and has been hunted by them ever since. Though many have tried, none can kill him or stop him from completing his current mission: to protect Kiara Zamir, a woman whose father’s political alliance has made her a target. As her world becomes even deadlier, Kiara must entrust her life to the same kind of beast who once killed her mother and left her for dead. Old enemies and new threaten them both and the only way they can survive is to overcome their suspicions and learn to trust in the very ones who threaten them the most: each other.	539	December 1st 1995	Caillen Dagan, Syn Wade, Nykyrian Quiakides, Kiara Zamir, Jayne, Pitala, Askel Quiakides, Arast Quiakides, Hauk, Keifer Zamir		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2992061-born-of-night
