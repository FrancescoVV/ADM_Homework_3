Operation Shylock: A Confession		Philip Roth	3.77	3901	279	What if a look-alike stranger stole your name, usurped your biography, and went about the world pretending to be you? In Operation Shylock, master novelist Philip Roth confronts his double, an impostor whose self-appointed task is to lead the Jews back to Europe from Israel. The "fake" Philip Roth becomes a monstrous nemesis to the "real" Philip Roth, who must take a frightening and mysterious journey through the volatile Middle East. Suspenseful, hilarious, and impassioned, Operation Shylock is at once a spy story, a political thriller, and a confession, pulsing with intelligence and intense narrative energy.	400	1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12881.Operation_Shylock
