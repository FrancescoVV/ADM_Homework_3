An Echo in the Darkness	Mark of the Lion #2	Francine Rivers	4.62	42147	1754	A prosperous trader, Marcus Lucianus Valerian has made a fortune providing sand and slaves for the Roman games. But Hadassah, a slave in his family's household, has enchanted him with her quiet beauty and her staunch faith in Christ. When Marcus' sister sends Hadassah to almost certain death in the games, Marcus feels that his life has been ripped apart. Now he is on his way to Jerusalem to find out more about Hadassah's god, unaware that a miracle awaits him back in Rome. The political intrigue of the imperial city provides a dramatic backdrop for Marcus' spiritual quest. This rich and unforgettable work achieves even greater impact through Richard Ferrone's dramatic narration.	461	1994	Marcus Lucianus Valerian, Julia Valerian, Hadassah		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46601.An_Echo_in_the_Darkness
