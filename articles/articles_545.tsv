Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster		Jon Krakauer	4.18	397414	13791	A bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that "suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down." He was wrong. The storm, which claimed five lives and left countless more--including Krakauer's--in guilt-ridden disarray, would also provide the impetus for Into Thin Air , Krakauer's epic account of the May 1996 disaster.	368	May 1st 1997	Rob Hall, Jon Krakauer	Nepal, Mount Everest	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air
