LOST AGAIN: A Novel in Stories		Michael    O'Neill	4.67	3	2	It's 1969: Man walks on the moon. Sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll reign for a weekend in upstate New York. Moratoriums across the country demand an end to the war in Vietnam. The wild 1960s windup with a bang, and an explosive new decade beckons the radical wannabes of Lost Again — until the March of Events leaves them behind. They're Young, Gifted, and Catholic: An irreverent ex-jock who breaks all the rules; a tough, pint-sized feminist; a nun turned lounge singer in love with a homeless radical; a buttoned-down student leader crusading to overturn a tenure decision; a burgeoning reporter in pursuit of a by-line; a striking girl who fancies herself Lady Brett Ashley, and many more: fervent college kids up against the wall of 1960s revolutionary promise in its sudden decline. Meet Them at Nicks: Join the muddled visionaries of Lost Again at Nick’s, a barroom hangout and former speak-easy, where their loss connects all of them — and us — to history. Sharp and funny, nostalgic and ironic, Lost Again draws a map to the past for the young, and dares the not-so-young to recall, regret, and rejoice!	670	July 24th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961235-lost-again
