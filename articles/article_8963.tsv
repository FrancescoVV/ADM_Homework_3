The Feds' Folly: Who Stole $17 Trillion?	Jones #2	Bill   Brown	4.20	147	3	In the sequel, The Feds' Folly, Who Stole $17 Trillion?, Jones, surviving his jet's bomb related crash, along with his girlfriend Mary, are "on the lam" eluding "hit squads" in the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, and England. They leverage damaging inside information provided by a Treasury mole to formulate an elaborate, albeit illegal, plan. If successful, their plan will not only expose the Feds' $17 trillion heist to the world, but it will also bring down the corrupt Swamp Rats in DC, and may even possibly exonerate Jones and his associates.	262	July 19th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40958353-the-feds-folly
