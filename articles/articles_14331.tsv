The Last Hour	Thompson Sisters #4	Charles Sheehan-Miles	4.34	2297	567	Twenty-seven year old Carrie Thompson-Sherman has the life she always wanted: her PhD, a prestigious fellowship, and an amazing husband. Her life begins to unravel as a jealous colleague puts her fellowship in jeopardy and a haunting secret Ray Sherman carried home from Afghanistan comes to light. Hounded by a federal investigation and the ensuing media feeding frenzy, Carrie and Ray desperately lean on each other, until a disastrous accident puts both Ray and her sister's lives at risk. In the last hour, Carrie and Ray will each find themselves faced with a choice. A choice that will change everything.	482	April 17th 2013	Carrie Thompson-Sherman, Ray Sherman		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17156406-the-last-hour
