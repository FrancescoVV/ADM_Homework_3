Abarat	Abarat #1	Clive Barker	4.09	25702	1400	Candy lives in Chickentown USA: the most boring place in the world, her heart bursting for some clue as to what her future may hold. She is soon to find out: swept out of our world by a giant wave, she finds herself in another place entirely... The Abarat: a vast archipelago where every island is a different hour of the day, from the sunlit wonders of Three in the Afternoon, where dragons roam, to the dark terrors of the island of Midnight, ruled by Christopher Carrion. Candy has a place in this extraordinary world: she has been brought here to help save the Abarat from the dark forces that are stirring at its heart. Forces older than time itself, and more evil than anything Candy has ever encountered.	393	October 1st 2002	Candy Francesca Quackenbush, Malingo, Christopher Carrion, Rojo Pixler, Otto Houlihan, Kaspar Wolfswinkel, John Mischief, Bill Quackenbush, Melissa Quackenbush, Samuel Hastrim Klepp the Fifth, Mendelson Shape, Norma Lipnik, Jimothi Tarrie		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/768878.Abarat
