Twilight	The Twilight Saga #1	Stephenie Meyer	3.60	4986404	104895	About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him. Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.	501	October 5th 2005	Edward Cullen, Jacob Black, Laurent, Renee, Bella Swan, Billy Black, Esme Cullen, Alice Cullen, Jasper Hale, Carlisle Cullen, Emmett Cullen, Rosalie Hale, Charlie Swan, Mike Newton, Jessica Stanley, Angela Weber, Tyler Crowley	Forks, Washington (United States), Phoenix, Arizona (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight
