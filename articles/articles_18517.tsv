Postmarked Baltimore		Jeff LeJeune	4.63	30	9	*NOTE: This revised edition is the author-preferred version, significantly different from the original released in 2008 by Broadmoor Books. One manâ€™s struggle with religion and love is at the heart of this tragic yet beautiful story. Perry Burns, a beloved Catholic priest, is rocked by a letter he receives from Noelle Rose, his lover in a former life. Perry is tormented by the return of memories and the sacrifices he has made for God. Both his conscience and a mysterious stranger practically force him onto the fateful trip into a past that will surface every thought and feeling he has worked so hard to bury. Heaven and hell are on the line, and once again, Perry must choose.	206	June 30th 2008		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35748605-postmarked-baltimore
