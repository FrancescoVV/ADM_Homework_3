Wedding Night		Sophie Kinsella	3.43	81604	6164	Lottie just knows that her boyfriend is going to propose, but then his big question involves a trip abroad — not a trip down the aisle. Completely crushed, Lottie reconnects with an old flame, and they decide to take drastic action. No dates, no moving in together, they’ll just get married . . . right now. Her sister, Fliss, thinks Lottie is making a terrible mistake, and will do anything to stop her. But Lottie is determined to say “I do,” for better, or for worse.	464	April 23rd 2013	Ben, Felicity, Charlotte (Lottie)	London, England (United Kingdom), Ikonos (Greece)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910611-wedding-night
