Sorcerer's Apprentice		Tahir Shah	4.17	931	92	As a child, Tahir Shah first learned the secrets of illusion from an Indian magician. Two decades later, he sets out in search of this man. Sorcerer's Apprentice is the story of his apprenticeship to one of India's master conjurors and his initiation into the brotherhood of godmen. Learning to unmask illusion as well as practice it, he goes on a journey across the subcontinent, seeking out its miraculous and bizarre underbelly, traveling from Calcutta to Madras, from Bangalore to Bombay, meeting sadhus, sages, sorcerers, hypnotists, and humbugs. His quest is utterly unforgettable. -- An extraordinary account of how illusion works and an astonishing portrait of a great illusionist.	323	January 1st 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181255.Sorcerer_s_Apprentice
