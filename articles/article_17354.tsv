The Morganville Vampires, #1-3	The Morganville Vampires #1-3	Rachel Caine	4.51	787	27	Welcome to Morganville. Just don't stay out after dark - Morganville is a small town filled with unusual characters - when the sun goes down, the bad come out. In Morganville, there is an evil that lurks in the darkest shadows - one that will spill out into the bright light of day. For Claire Danvers, high school was hell, but college may be murder. It was bad enough that she got on the wrong side of Monica, the meanest of the school's mean girls, but now she's got three new roommates, who all have secrets of their own. And the biggest secret of all isn't really a secret, except from Claire: Morganville is run by vampires, and they are hungry for fresh blood.	992	October 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8130013-the-morganville-vampires-1-3
