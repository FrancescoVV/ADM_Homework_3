Taking Chances	Heartland #4	Lauren Brooke	4.13	2976	67	Heartland is a horse farm nestled in the hills of Virginia, but it's much more than that. Heartland is like no other place - it's a place where the scars of the past can be healed, a place where frightened and abused horses learn to trust again. Amy knows that Ty is important to Heartland - and to her. Ty is the only other person who truly understands the meaning of Heartland, who is as dedicated to rescuing and curing horses as she is. But their friendship is thrown off balance when Ben, the new stable hand, arrives. And by the time Amy realizes she's pushed Ty away, he may have decided to leave Heartland forever.	175	2001	Amy Fleming, Jack Bartlett, Lou Fleming, Ty Baldwin, Soraya Martin, Matt Trewin, Scott Trewin, Val Grant, Ashley Grant, Ben Stillman, Claire Whitely, Mrs. Whitely		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/904959.Taking_Chances
