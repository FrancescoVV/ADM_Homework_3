Blowing out her candles, Kayla thinks: I wish my birthday wishes actually came true. Because they never freakin' do. Kayla wakes the next day to a life-sized, bright pink My Little Pony outside her window. Then a year's supply of gumballs arrives. A boy named Ken with a disturbing resemblance to the doll of the same name stalks her. As the ghosts of Kayla's wishes-past appear, they take her on a wild ride...but they must stop . Because when she was fifteen? She wished Ben Mackenzie would kiss her. And Ben is her best friend's boyfriend.	304	July 29th 2010	Raggedy Ann, Kayla McHenry, Ben Mackenzie, Nicole, Ken Carson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7092507-you-wish
