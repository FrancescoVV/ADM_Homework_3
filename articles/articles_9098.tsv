Turns out, I couldn't have been more wrong. "Ethan Wate used to think of Gatlin, the small Southern town he had always called home, as a place where nothing ever changed. Then he met mysterious newcomer Lena Duchannes, who revealed a secret world where a curse has marked Lena's family of powerful Supernaturals for generations. Mysterious, suspenseful, and romantic, "Beautiful Creatures, Beautiful Darkness," "Beautiful Chaos," and "Beautiful Redemption "introduce a secret world hidden in plain sight. A world where impossible, magical, life-altering events happen. Sometimes life-ending. This stunning set makes the perfect gift for fans of this bestselling Southern gothic romance.	2035	October 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13537830-the-beautiful-creatures-complete-collection
