The Warden	Chronicles of Barsetshire #1	Anthony Trollope, David Skilton, Robin Gilmour	3.73	13074	1323	The Warden centers on Mr. Harding, a clergyman of great personal integrity who is nevertheless in possession of an income from a charity far in excess of the sum devoted to the purposes of the foundation. On discovering this, young John Bold turns his reforming zeal to exposing what he regards as an abuse of privilege, despite the fact that he is in love with Mr. Harding's daughter Eleanor. It was a highly topical novel (a case regarding the misapplication of church funds was the scandalous subject of contemporary debate), but like other great Victorian novelists, Trollope uses the specific case to explore and illuminate the universal complexities of human motivation and social morality	336	1855	Septimus Harding, John Bold, Eleanor Harding, Susan Harding, Rev.
