Wondrous Strange	Wondrous Strange #1	Lesley Livingston	3.69	20750	1502	Seventeen-year-old actress Kelley Winslow thinks that playing the role of the fairy queen Titania in a production of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream could be her lucky break - if she can pull it off. But when she meets the handsome Sonny Flannery, Kelley has to face the shocking truth that the world of Faeries is all too real - and that she is an unwitting part of it. Sonny warns Kelley that she is no mere mortal, and that she is being haunted by powerful forces from the Faerie realm. Now, Kelley must come to terms with her heritage - and her growing feelings for Sonny - if she wants to save not only herself, but also the human world that she holds dear.	327	December 23rd 2008	Auberon (Wondrous Strange), Kelley Winslow, Sonny Flannery, Tyffanwy of the Mere, Herne (Wondrous Strange), Mabh (Wondrous Strange), Maddox (Wondrous Strange), Bob (Wondrous Strange)	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3064985-wondrous-strange
