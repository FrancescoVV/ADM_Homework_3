We had kids. We moved to the suburbs. We told each other our biggest dreams, and our darkest secrets. And then we got bored. We look like a normal couple. We're your neighbors, the parents of your kid's friend, the acquaintances you keep meaning to get dinner with. We all have secrets to keeping a marriage alive. Ours just happens to be getting away with murder. Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780451491725	390	March 26th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39796904-my-lovely-wife
