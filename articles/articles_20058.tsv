The King's Coat	Alan Lewrie #1	Dewey Lambdin	4.06	2517	140	The very first Alan Lewrie naval adventure in this classic series is now back in print! 1780: Seventeen-year-old Alan Lewrie is a brash, rebellious young libertine. So much so that his callous father believes a bit of navy discipline will turn the boy around. Fresh aboard the tall-masted Ariadne, Midshipman Lewrie heads for the war-torn Americas, finding--rather unexpectedly--that he is a born sailor, equally at home with the randy pleasures of the port and the raging battles on the high seas. But in a hail of cannonballs comes a bawdy surprise. . . .	384	1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181195.The_King_s_Coat
