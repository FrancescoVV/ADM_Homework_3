This Lullaby		Sarah Dessen	4.02	171185	5091	When it comes to relationships, Remy doesn't mess around. After all, she's learned all there is to know from her mother, who's currently working on husband number five. But there's something about Dexter that seems to defy all of Remy's rules. He certainly doesn't seem like Mr. Right. For some reason, however, Remy just can't seem to shake him. Could it be that Remy's starting to understand what those love songs are all about?	345	May 27th 2002	Remy Starr, Dexter Jones	Lakeview, North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22205.This_Lullaby
