Christmas is coming and Mrs. Carter treats the girls to a weekend trip to General Harding s luxurious Vermont ski lodge. Naturally, she has no idea that Taylor has invited some guys to follow them boys who have a different type of adventure in mind. As usual, Mrs. Carter does not pay close attention to the girls activities. When a dinner outing and small accident keep her away overnight, DJ, Eliza, Taylor, Kriti, Rhiannon, and Casey are quickly in over their heads.
