Gabriel García Márquez: One Hundred Years of Solitude	Landmarks of World Literature	Michael  Wood	4.55	4616	97	One Hundred Years of Solitude is perhaps the most important landmark of the so-called Boom in contemporary Latin American fiction. Published in 1967, the novel was an instant success, running to hundreds of editions, winning four international prizes and being translated into 27 languages. In 1982, its author received the Nobel Prize for Literature. Michael Wood places the novel in the context of modern Colombia's violent history, and helps the reader to explore the rich and complex vision of the world which Garcia Marquez presents in it. Close reference is made to the text itself (in English translation), and there is a guide to further reading.	132	May 31st 1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28087.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez
