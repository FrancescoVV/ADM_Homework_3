Zen and the Art of Vampires	Dark Ones #6	Katie MacAlister	3.99	4975	232	White picket fences can be dangerous to vampires. Sometimes a woman’s gotta choose… Pia Thomason doesn’t have a typical life, but she wants one. The husband, the kids, the house in the suburbs… With her fortieth birthday looming, she decides to do something drastic, and takes off on a singles’ tour through romantic Europe. But the few guys on the trip leave much to be desired—unlike the two men Pia sees in a small Icelandic town. Handsome, mysterious, and very dangerous… Just the sight of them puts her in a dither. When their paths cross again, Pia knows one thing for certain: Where vampires are concerned, love isn’t the only thing at stake.	332	December 2nd 2008	Pia Thomason, Kristoff		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3073174-zen-and-the-art-of-vampires
