The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System, Being also a Theory of Crises		Henryk Grossmann, Jairus Banaji, Tony Kennedy	4.50	10	1	'Law of Accumulation, first published in German in 1929 , is one of the seminal works of Marxian political economy, both in its method and in substantive theory. Reissued in the original German in 1970 , Grossmann's work has also appeared in Japanese, but there has never (until now) been an English edition. This is an important volume ... it will be essential reading for anyone with an interest in the development of Marxian economic theory.'
