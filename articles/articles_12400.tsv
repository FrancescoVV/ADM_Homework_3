Gold		Chris Cleave	3.69	15246	2423	Building on the tradition of Little Bee, Chris Cleave again writes with elegance, humor, and passion about friendship, marriage, parenthood, tragedy, and redemption. Gold is the story of Zoe and Kate, world-class athletes who have been friends and rivals since their first day of Elite training. They've loved, fought, betrayed, forgiven, consoled, gloried, and grown up together. Now on the eve of London 2012, their last Olympics, both women will be tested to their physical and emotional limits. They must confront each other and their own mortality to decide, when lives are at stake: What would you sacrifice for the people you love, if it meant giving up the thing that was most important to you in the world?	384	January 1st 2012	Sophie, Zoe Castle, Kate Meadows, Tom Voss, Jack Argalls	Athens (Greece), Manchester, England, Lusanne (Switzerland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15015218-gold
