The Sheriff's Catch	The Sassana Stone Pentalogy #1	James Vella-Bardon	4.59	100	58	1588. Abel de Santiago has deserted the army and all but avenged his murdered wife, when he is captured and sold as a galley slave. As the Spanish Armada sails for England, there can be few souls on board more reluctant than him. After a crushing defeat to the enemy fleet, the Spanish ships are battered by extraordinary storms and Santiago finds himself washed ashore in Ireland, a country terrorised by English troops that the natives call Sassenachs. But Santiago’s faint hopes of survival appear dashed when he is captured by a brutal Sheriff, who has orders from Dublin to torture and kill all Spanish castaways. An unlikely escape has Santiago flee with a jewelled ring worth a King’s ransom. His flight leads to a desperate chase across a strange and stunning land, where danger lurks at every turn.
