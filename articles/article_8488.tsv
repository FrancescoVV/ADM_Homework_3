The Citadel		A.J. Cronin	4.19	6626	479	"Cronin's distinguished achievement....No one could have written as fine, honest, and moving a study of a young doctor as The Citadel without possessing great literary taste and skill." -- The Atlantic Monthly A groundbreaking novel of its time and a National Book Award winner. The Citadel follows the life of Andrew Manson, a young and idealistic Scottish doctor, as he navigates the challenges of practicing medicine across interwar Wales and England. Based on Cronin's own experiences as a physician, The Citadel boldly confronts traditional medical ethics, and has been noted as one of the inspirations for the formation of the National Health Service. The Citadel has been adapted into several successful film, radio, and television productions around the world, including the Oscar-nominated 1938 film starring Ralph Donat, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Richardson, and Rex Harrison.	368	1937	Andrew Manson, Dr Philip Denny, Christine Barlow (Manson), Dr Hope	Drineffy (United Kingdom), Aberalaw (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634747.The_Citadel
