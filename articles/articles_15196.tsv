Pippi Goes on Board	Pippi Långstrump #2	Astrid Lindgren, Florence Lamborn, Nancy Seligsohn	4.13	12019	243	Outrageous Pippi Longstocking has no parents around and no rules to follow, so she lives according to her own daredevilish ways. She's been treating her friends Tommy and Annika to wild adventures, too--like buying and eating seventy-two pounds of candy, or sailing off to an island in the middle of a lake to see what it's like to be shipwrecked. But then Pippi's long lost father returns, and she might have to leave Villa Villekulla! From the Hans Christian Andersen Medal-winning author of the classic P ippi Longstocking , this is another rollicking adventure that's sure to please fans of the freckled, fun-loving little girl. Lovers of Pippi Longstocking will welcome this rollicking tale of a topsy-turvy world in which Pippi and her next-door neighbors put into practice some ideas about good times. - School Library Journal	140	1946	Tommy Settergren, Pippi Långstrump, Annika Gannec	Sweden	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19308.Pippi_Goes_on_Board
