The Golovlyov Family		Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Natalie Duddington, James  Wood	4.05	2325	112	Searingly hot in the summer, bitterly cold in the winter, the ancestral estate of the Golovlyov family is the end of the road. There Anna Petrovna rules with an iron hand over her servants and family-until she loses power to the relentless scheming of her hypocritical son Porphyry. One of the great classic novels of Russian literature, The Golovlyov Family is a vivid picture of a condemned and isolated outpost of civilization that, for contemporary readers, will recall the otherwordly reality of Macondo in Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude.	358	1880	Vladimir Mikhaylovich Golovlyov, Arina Petrovna, Stepan Vladimirovich, Anna Vladimirovna, Porfiry Vladimirovich, Pavel Vladimirovich		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132543.The_Golovlyov_Family
