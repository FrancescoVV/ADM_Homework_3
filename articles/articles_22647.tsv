Maggie: A Girl of the Streets		Stephen Crane	3.34	7264	382	In 1892 Stephen Crane (1871-1900) published Maggie, Girl of the Streets at his own expense. Considered at the time to be immature, it was a failure. Since that time it has come to be considered one of the earliest American realistic novels. Maggie is the story of a pretty child of the Bowery which is written with the same intensity and vivid scenes of his masterpiece -- The Red Badge of Courage . In her short life, Maggie "blossomed in a mud puddle", was driven to prostitution, and died by her own hand while still a teenager. Crane, who worked as a free lance reporter, was in many ways addicted to the low life of the cities. He died at the age of 29.	92	1893		New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208977.Maggie
