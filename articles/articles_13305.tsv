The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig		Eugene Trivizas, Helen Oxenbury, Ευγένιος Τριβιζάς	4.21	12277	723	When it comes time for the three little wolves to go out into the world and build themselves a house, their mother warns them to beware the big bad pig. But the little wolves' increasingly sturdy dwellings are no match for the persistent porker, who has more up his sleeve than huffing and puffing. It takes a chance encounter with a flamingo pushing a wheelbarrow full of flowers to provide a surprising and satisfying solution to the little wolves' housing crisis. Eugene Trivizas's hilarious text and Helen Oxenbury's enchanting watercolors have made this delightfully skewed version of the traditional tale a contemporary classic.	32	1993	Big Bad Pig, Black Little Wolf, White Little Wolf, Gray Little Wolf, Mother Wolf		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/839077.The_Three_Little_Wolves_and_the_Big_Bad_Pig
