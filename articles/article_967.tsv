Now, because she believes she is dying, Helen wants to expose everything. And Winnie angrily determines that she must be the one to tell her daughter, Pearl, about the pastâ€”including the terrible truth even Helen does not know. And so begins Winnie's story of her life on a small island outside Shanghai in the 1920s, and other places in China during World War II, and traces the happy and desperate events that led to Winnie's coming to America in 1949.	416	1991	Winnie, Auntie Helen, Pearl Bright, Mary, Frank Russell, Roger "Bao Bao", Doug Cheu, Phil Brandt, Tessa Russo, Cleo, Mimi Wong, Loy Fong, Edna Fong, New Aunt, Old Aunt, Wen Fu, Huazheng "Peanut", Uncle Henry	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12557.The_Kitchen_God_s_Wife
