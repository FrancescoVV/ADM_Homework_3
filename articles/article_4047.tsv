The Monstrumologist	The Monstrumologist #1	Rick Yancey	3.89	17742	2781	These are the secrets I have kept. This is the trust I never betrayed. But he is dead now and has been for more than forty years, the one who gave me his trust, the one for whom I kept these secrets. The one who saved me . . . and the one who cursed me. So starts the diary of Will Henry, orphaned assistant to Dr. Pellinore Warthorpe, a man with a most unusual specialty: monstrumology, the study of monsters. In his time with the doctor, Will has met many a mysterious late-night visitor, and seen things he never imagined were real. But when a grave robber comes calling in the middle of the night with a gruesome find, he brings with him their most deadly case yet. A gothic tour de force that explores the darkest heart of man and monster and asks the question: When does man become the very thing he hunts?	434	September 22nd 2009	Pellinore Warthrop, Will Henry, Jack Kearns	New Jerusalem	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6457229-the-monstrumologist
