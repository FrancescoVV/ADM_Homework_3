DotCom Secrets: The Underground Playbook for Growing Your Company Online		Russell Brunson, Dan S. Kennedy	4.39	2332	212	If you are currently struggling with getting traffic to your website, or converting that traffic when it shows up, you may think you’ve got a traffic or conversion problem. In Russell Brunson's experience, after working with thousands of businesses, he has found that’s rarely the case. Low traffic and weak conversion numbers are just symptoms of a much greater problem, a problem that’s a little harder to see (that’s the bad news), but a lot easier to fix (that’s the good news). DotComSecrets will give you the marketing funnels and the sales scripts you need to be able to turn on a flood of new leads into your business.	274	February 20th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25054961-dotcom-secrets
