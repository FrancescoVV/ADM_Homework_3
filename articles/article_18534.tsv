Physics for Rock Stars: Making the Laws of the Universe Work for You		Christine McKinley	4.07	169	39	From the host of the History channel's Brad Meltzer's Decoded: the laws of the universe like you've never experienced them before. This approachable book explains the world of physics with clarity, humor, and a dash of adventure. Physics for Rock Stars is not a weighty treatise on science, but a personal tour of physics from a quirky friend. Anyone who's ever wondered why nature abhors a vacuum, what causes magnetic attraction, or how to jump off a moving train or do a perfect stage dive will find answers and a few laughs too. No equations, numbers, or tricky concepts--just an inspiring and comical romp through the basics of physics and the beauty of the organized universe.	248	June 3rd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693742-physics-for-rock-stars
