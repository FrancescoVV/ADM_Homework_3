The philosophy of human death		Adam Świeżyński	5.00	1	0	"Presenting the evolutionary approach to human death, I try to emphasize the relationships that occur between science and faith, and the possibility of combining the religious doctrine of Christianity with the findings of natural sciences and philosophical anthropology. Therefore, this publication should be treated as an attempt at a synthesis of faith and rational philosophical argumentation which may help build a comprehensive, coherent view of the world".
