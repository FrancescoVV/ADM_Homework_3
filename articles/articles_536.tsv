Now with the group narrowed down to the six Elite, the competition to win Prince Maxon's heart is fiercer than ever—and America is still struggling to decide where her heart truly lies. Is it with Maxon, who could make her life a fairy tale? Or with her first love, Aspen? America is desperate for more time. But the rest of the Elite know exactly what they want—and America's chance to choose is about to slip away.	336	April 23rd 2013	Celeste White, Elise Whisks, Aspen Leger, America Singer, Prince Maxon, Kriss Ambers		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248068-the-elite
