Unlit Star		Lindy Zart	4.14	4384	639	We are not guaranteed anything, not even this life. Rivers Young is the popular guy untouchable by reality. He is like a starâ€”bright, consuming, otherworldly. The thing about stars, though, is that they eventually fall, and he is no different. He falls far and he falls hard. Delilah Bana is the outcast enshrouded in all of life's ironies. Alone, in the dark, like dusk as it falls on the world. When Rivers hits the ground, she is the night that catches him. In the darkness, they meld into something beautiful that shines like the sun. Only, the greater the star is, the shorter its lifespan.	258	August 20th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23007471-unlit-star
