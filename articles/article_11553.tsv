Voluntary Madness		Vicki Hendricks	3.20	662	15	Punch is a beautiful man in his forties, slowly dying from alcohol abuse and diabetes. Juliette is his young, naive and adoring girlfriend, willing to do absolutely anything for him. Together they have made a twisted pact: to live a wild life in Key West, collecting material for the book Punch wants to write before they end it all a year later. Punch and Juliette?s craziness quickly accelerates. She flashes at strangers; he pretends to be blind in public; they break into Hemingway?s house to have sex. But the games quickly turn dangerous when a guard at the house interrupts them and dies in the assault. With money running out, Punch and Juliette get a gun and stage a series of restaurant heists in elaborate disguises. They?re known and loved by the restaurants, whose customers thrill to the safe danger of the notorious duo?s antics. But finally the danger escalates, and Juliette has to decide whether she?ll keep her part of the pact.	224	May 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552106.Voluntary_Madness
