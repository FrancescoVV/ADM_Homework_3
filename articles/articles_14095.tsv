Adorkable		Sarra Manning	3.59	5606	719	Welcome to the dorkside. It's going to be a bumpy ride... Jeane Smith's a blogger, a dreamer, a dare-to-dreamer, a jumble sale queen, CEO of her own lifestyle brand and has half a million followers on twitter. Michael Lee's a star of school, stage and playing field. A golden boy in a Jack Wills hoodie. They have nothing in common but a pair of cheating exes. So why can't they stop snogging?	387	May 24th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10890319-adorkable
