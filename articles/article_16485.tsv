Heaven	A Prison Diary #3	Jeffrey Archer	3.91	2042	76	Heaven, Jeffrey Archer's final volume in his trilogy of prison diaries, covers the period of his transfer from a medium security prison, HMP Wayland, to his eventual release on parole in July 2003. It includes a shocking account of the traumatic time he spent in the notorious Lincoln jail and the events that led to his incarceration there, and also shines a harsh light on a system that is close to its breaking point. Told with humor, compassion, and honesty, the diary closes with a thought-provoking manifesto that will be applauded by reform advocates and the prison population alike.	480	2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78974.Heaven
