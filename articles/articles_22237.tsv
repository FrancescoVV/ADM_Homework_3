Hurting Distance	Spilling CID #2	Sophie Hannah	3.71	5748	563	Three years ago, something terrible happened to Naomi Jenkins - she told nobody. Now she has another secret - the man she has fallen in love with, unhappily married Robert Haworth. When he vanishes, Naomi knows he must have come to harm. But the police are less convinced, particularly when Robert's wife insists he's not missing.	408	August 23rd 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1384415.Hurting_Distance
