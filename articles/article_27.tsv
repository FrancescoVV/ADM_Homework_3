Crime and Punishment		Fyodor Dostoyevsky, David McDuff	4.22	630618	19378	Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer the chance of redemption.	671	1866	Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, Porfiry Petrovich, Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova, Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov, Dmitri Prokofich Razumikhin, Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladova, Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov, Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, Andrei Semyonovich Lebezyatnikov, Alyona Ivanovna, Lizaveta Ivanovna, Zossimov, Nastasya Petrovna (“Nastenka,” “Nastasyushka”), Ilya Petrovich (“Gunpowder”), Alexander Grigorievich Zamyotov, Nikolai Dementiev (“Mikolka”), Polina Mikhailovna Marmeladov (“Polya,” “Polenka,” “Polechka”)	Russian Empire, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, Siberia (Russian Federation)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment
