Alice in Zombieland	White Rabbit Chronicles #1	Gena Showalter	4.03	39780	5223	She won't rest until she's sent every walking corpse back to its grave. Forever. If anyone had told Alice Bell that her entire life would change course between one heartbeat and the next, she would have laughed. From blissful to tragic, innocent to ruined? Please. But that's all it took. One heartbeat. A blink, a breath, a second, and everything she knew and loved was gone. Her father was right. The monsters are real. To avenge her family, Ali must learn to fight the undead. To survive, she must learn to trust the baddest of the bad boys, Cole Holland. But Cole has secrets of his own, and if Ali isn't careful, those secrets might just prove to be more dangerous than the zombies.	404	September 25th 2012	Alice Bell, Cole Holland, Emma Lily		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11300302-alice-in-zombieland
