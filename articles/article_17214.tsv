The Mosaic of the Broken Soul		Branka Cubrilo	2.82	11	8	She called the lump in Her breast 'a black pearl', She called her Mother to nurse Her in the darkest hours, She called memories of the three men She loved at different times of Her life to draw the parallels between seemingly similar situations of betrayal. Who is going to betray Her, who is going to stay...? She struggles with the meaning of life trying to find it through themes of motherhood, friendship, betrayal, displacement, illness, pain, grief and loss. She travelled to Andalucia, London, The Isle of Man, where she met colourful characters believing that the unknown can reverse the fragmentation and change reality, believing that all the little broken selves can once again bring the broken pieces into a cohesive mosaic.	320	May 24th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8544270-the-mosaic-of-the-broken-soul
