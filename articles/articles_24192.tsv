A Whisper of Leaves		Ashley Capes	3.42	149	42	When ESL teacher Riko finds an old journal buried in the forests beneath Mt Fuji, a malevolent, untraceable force begins to threaten her at every turn. But is it all in her head? The more she studies the journal for answers, the more questions she uncovers. Worse, no-one takes her fears seriously and her best lead appears to be a belligerent old man, whose only care in the world is raking leaves deep in the forest. With her grip on reality shaken and friendships strained to breaking point, Riko must discover the truth about the journal in order to put ghosts of the past to rest, as strange events turn deadly.	148	May 11th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25266010-a-whisper-of-leaves
