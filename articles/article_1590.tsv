Winesburg, Ohio		Sherwood Anderson	3.84	30182	2298	Winesburg, Ohio depicts the strange, secret lives of the inhabitants of a small town. In "Hands," Wing Biddlebaum tries to hide the tale of his banishment from a Pennsylvania town, a tale represented by his hands. In "Adventure," lonely Alice Hindman impulsively walks naked into the night rain. Threaded through the stories is the viewpoint of George Willard, the young newspaper reporter who, like his creator, stands witness to the dark and despairing dealings of a community of isolated people.	240	May 8th 1919	Elizabeth Willard, Doctor Parcival, Louise Trunnion, Jesse Bentley, Louise Bentley, David Hardy, Joe Welling, Alice Hindman, Wash Williams, Seth Richmond, Tandy Hard, The Reverend Curtis Hartman, Kate Swift, Enoch Robinson, Belle Carpenter, Elmer Cowley, Ray Pearson, Tom Foster, Helen White, George Willard		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80176.Winesburg_Ohio
