Now she introduces Libby Drake, of the magical Drake sisters—each mysterious, gifted, and enchanted by prophecies of love… Dr. Libby Drake is sensible and practical. To her more adventurous sisters, she’s always been the “good girl”. Certainly not the kind to attract the attention of a genius like Ty Derrick—until a tragic accident leaves the handsome biochemist at her mercy. Acting on her uncanny ability to heal, she stirs in the reawakened Ty his own long-suppressed desires for the woman who saved his life. But he’s not the only man with designs on Libby Drake.

And he’s willing to go to deadly lengths to make it happen.	354	June 27th 2006	Libby Drake, Ty Derrick	Sea Haven, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313260.Dangerous_Tides
