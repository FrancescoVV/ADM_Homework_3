Twelve years of trying to watch over her and her children. Twelve years of being the dependable friend, of seeing his beauty married to a beast. Twelve years of hell. Now he was going to change, although he knew he'd have to be careful, move slow. But if Cassie came any closer, he might just toss her over his shoulder and carry her off! And he wasn't sure either of them was quite ready for that yet. But soon.... The MacKade Brothers: Looking for trouble -- and always finding it. Now they're on a collision course with love.	256	March 1st 1996	Cassie Connor, Devin MacKade	Antietam, Maryland (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658499.The_Heart_of_Devin_MacKade
