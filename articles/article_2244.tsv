White Nights		Fyodor Dostoyevsky	4.02	49379	4008	White Nights, is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky that was published in 1848. Set in St. Petersburg, this is the story of a young man fighting his inner restlessness. A light and tender narrative, it delves into the torment and guilt of unrequited love. Both protagonists suffer from a deep sense of alienation that initially brings them together. A blend of romanticism and realism, the story appeals gently to the senses and feelings.	82	1848	Nastenka	Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation), Imperio ruso	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1772910.White_Nights
