A bright young star in a multinational conglomerate, she's living well in a post-millennial age of peace, prosperity, and profit. In an age of advanced technology, information is the world's most precious commodity. Information is power. Data is locked in computers and carefully rationed through a global communications network. Full access is a privilege held by few. Now, Laura Webster is about to be plunged into a netherworld of black-market data pirates, new-age mercenaries, high-tech voodoo... and murder.	396	June 1st 1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218571.Islands_in_the_Net
