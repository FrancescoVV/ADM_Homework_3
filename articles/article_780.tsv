Tender Is the Night		F. Scott Fitzgerald, Amor Towles	3.81	114377	4896	Set on the French Riviera in the late 1920s, Tender Is the Night is the tragic romance of the young actress Rosemary Hoyt and the stylish American couple Dick and Nicole Diver. A brilliant young psychiatrist at the time of his marriage, Dick is both husband and doctor to Nicole, whose wealth goads him into a lifestyle not his own, and whose growing strength highlights Dick's harrowing demise. A profound study of the romantic concept of character, Tender Is the Night is lyrical, expansive, and hauntingly evocative.	315	April 1934	Dick Diver, Nicole Diver, Rosemary Hoyt, Elsie Speers, Abe North, Franz Gregorovius, Baby Warren, Tommy Barban	French Riviera (France), France, Switzerland, Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46164.Tender_Is_the_Night
