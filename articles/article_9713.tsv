Scorched	Scorched #1	Mari Mancusi	3.78	3210	484	Trinity Don’t leave me here... It starts with a whisper. At first Trinity thinks she’s going crazy. It wouldn’t be a big surprise—her grandpa firmly believes there’s a genuine dragon egg in their dusty little West Texas town. But this voice is real, and it’s begging for her protection. Even if no one else can hear it... Connor He’s come from a future scorched by dragonfire. His mission: Find the girl. Destroy the egg. Save the world. Caleb He’s everything his twin brother Connor hates: cocky, undisciplined, and obsessed with saving dragons. Trinity has no idea which brother to believe. All she has to go by is the voice in her head—a dragon that won’t be tamed.	352	September 3rd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16006945-scorched
