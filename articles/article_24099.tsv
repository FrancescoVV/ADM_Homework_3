But he can hear; he is aware. His friends and family try desperately to reach him – even Zola, his favourite Chelsea footballer, comes to see him. And still Robbie can’t ‘wake up’. Until one day, against hospital rules, Dad brings Lucky into the hospital. Can Lucky bring Robbie back to life?	112	January 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1527414.Cool_
