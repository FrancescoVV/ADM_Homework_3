Babylon Rising (updated and expanded): And The First Shall Be Last		Rob Skiba	4.26	178	21	What do the Mayan prophecies, the Aztec Calendar Stone, the symbols on America's Great Seal and the U.S. Capitol Building all have in common? Will the first Antichrist rise again? Will ancient Babylon once again become a prominent player in the Last Days? Will America be the catalyst through which both return? Why do the actions of our presidents, the iconography on the back of the U.S. one dollar bill, and the monuments of Washington, DC all seem to indicate that it will be? Find out in this updated and expanded edition of Babylon Rising: And The First Shall Be Last.	372	March 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18887751-babylon-rising
