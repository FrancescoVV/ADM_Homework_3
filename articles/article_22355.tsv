Love Minus Eighty		Will McIntosh	3.81	2854	415	The words were gentle strokes, drawing her awake. "Hello. Hello there." She felt the light on her eyelids, and knew that if she opened her eyes they would sting, and she would have to shade them with her palm and let the light bleed through a crack. "Feel like talking?" A man's soft voice. And then her mind cleared enough to wonder: who was this man at her bedside? She tried to sigh, but no breath came. Her eyes flew open in alarm. In the future, love is complicated. Technology moves ever forward. To be disconnected from the maze of social networking is to be an outcast. Even death doesn't have to be the end. An impossible love story is about to unfold between a hit-and-run victim and her killer.	432	June 11th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16100436-love-minus-eighty
