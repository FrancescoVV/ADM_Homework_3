The Last Ever After	The School for Good and Evil #3	Soman Chainani	4.31	20580	1885	In the epic next chapter of Soman Chainani’s New York Times bestselling series, The School for Good and Evil, everything old is new again as Sophie and Agatha fight the past as well as the present to find the perfect end to their story. As A World Without Princes closed, the end was written and former best friends Sophie and Agatha went their separate ways. Agatha was whisked back to Gavaldon with Tedros and Sophie stayed behind with the beautiful young School Master. But as they settle into their new lives, their story begs to be re-written, and this time, theirs isn’t the only one. With the girls apart, Evil has taken over and the villains of the past have come back to change their tales and turn the world of Good and Evil upside down. Readers around the world are eagerly awaiting the third book in The School for Good and Evil series, The Last Ever After. This extraordinary new journey delivers more action, adventure, laughter, romance and fairy tale twists and turns than you could ever dream of!	655	July 21st 2015	Lancelot du Lac, Lady Pocus (SFGAE), Agatha (SFGAE), Sophie (SFGAE), School Master (SFGAE), Aric (SFGAE), Guinevere (SFGAE), Professor Clarissa Dovey (SFGAE), Merlin (SFGAE), Nimue- Lady of the Lake (SFGAE), Hester (SFGAE), Anadil (SFGAE), Dot (SFGAE), Tedros (SFGAE), Hort (SFGAE), Nicholas (SFGAE), Ravan (SFGAE), Leonora Lesso (SFGAE), August Sader (SFGAE), Professor Emma Anemone (SFGAE), Professor Bilious Manley (SFGAE), Professor Aleksander Lukas (SFGAE), Professor Sheeba Sheeks (SFGAE), Yuba the Gnome (SFGAE), Professor Rumi Espada (SFGAE), Princess Uma (SFGAE), Castor the Dog (SFGAE), Pollux the Dog (SFGAE), Reaper Cat (SFGAE), Callis (SFGAE), Stefan (SFGAE)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18004320-the-last-ever-after
