Hideaway	Devil's Night #2	Penelope Douglas	4.22	13239	1600	DEVIL'S NIGHT is returning! Hiding places, chases, and all the games are back... BANKS Buried in the shadows of the city, there’s a hotel called The Pope. Ailing, empty, and dark—it sits abandoned and surrounded by a forgotten mystery. But you think it’s true, don’t you, Kai Mori? The story about the hidden twelfth floor. The mystery of the dark guest who never checked in and never checks out. You think I can help you find that secret hideaway and get to him, don’t you? You and your friends can try to scare me. You can try to push me. Because even though I struggle to hide everything I feel when you look at me—and have ever since I was a girl—I think maybe what you seek is so much closer than you’ll ever realize. I will never betray him. So sit tight. On Devil’s Night, the hunt will be coming to you. KAI You have no idea what I seek, Little One. You don’t know what I had to become to survive three years in prison for a crime I would gladly commit again. No one can know what I’ve turned into. I want that hotel, I want to find him, and I want this over. I want my life back. But the more I’m around you, the more I realize this new me is exactly who I was meant to be. So come on, kid. Don’t chicken out. My house is on the hill. So many ways in, and good luck finding your way out. I’ve seen your hideaway. Time to see mine. *Hideaway is a romantic suspense suitable for ages 18+. While the romance is a stand-alone, the plot is a continuation of events that began in CORRUPT (Devil's Night, #1). It is strongly recommended that you have read Corrupt prior to reading this.	466	October 1st 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29082755-hideaway
