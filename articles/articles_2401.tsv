The Golem and the Jinni	The Golem and the Jinni #1	Helene Wecker	4.08	103784	12765	Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic, created to be the wife of a man who dies at sea on the voyage from Poland. Chava is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York harbor in 1899. Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire born in the ancient Syrian desert, trapped in an old copper flask, and released in New York City, though still not entirely free. Ahmad and Chava become unlikely friends and soul mates with a mystical connection. Marvelous and compulsively readable, Helene Wecker's debut novel The Golem and the Jinni weaves strands of Yiddish and Middle Eastern literature, historical fiction and magical fable, into a wondrously inventive and unforgettable tale.	486	April 1st 2013	Ahmad Al-Hadid, Chava, Yehudah Schaalman, Rabbi Avram Meyer, Boutros Arbeely, Maryam Faddoul, Michael Levy, Mahmoud Saleh, Sayeed Faddoul, Moe Radzin, Thea Radzin, Anna Blumberg, Sophia Winston, Fadwa al-Hadid	New York City, New York (United States), The Syrian Desert (Syrian Arab Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni
