The Death of Mrs. Westaway		Ruth Ware	3.82	108547	12461	On a day that begins like any other, Hal receives a mysterious letter bequeathing her a substantial inheritance. She realizes very quickly that the letter was sent to the wrong person—but also that the cold-reading skills she’s honed as a tarot card reader might help her claim the money. Soon, Hal finds herself at the funeral of the deceased…where it dawns on her that there is something very, very wrong about this strange situation and the inheritance at the centre of it.	388	May 29th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373481-the-death-of-mrs-westaway
