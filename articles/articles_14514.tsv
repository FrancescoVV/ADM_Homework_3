And the Trees Crept In		Dawn Kurtagich	3.55	4777	1291	Stay away from the woods… When Silla and Nori arrive at their aunt’s home, it’s immediately clear that the manor is cursed. The endless creaking of the house at night and the eerie stillness of the woods surrounding them would be enough of a sign, but there are secrets too—questions that Silla can’t ignore: Why does it seem that, ever since they arrived, the trees have been creeping closer? Who is the beautiful boy who’s appeared from the woods? And who is the tall man with no eyes who Nori plays with in the basement at night… a man no one else can see?	352	September 6th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449150-and-the-trees-crept-in
