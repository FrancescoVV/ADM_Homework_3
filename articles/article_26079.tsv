The Beauty of Gods Holiness		Thomas L. Trevethan	4.60	5	1	In a book that is at once a manifesto and a devotional guide, Trevethan vividly reminds us that holiness is an essential characteristic of the biblical Lord. Like few other books recently written, The Beauty of God's Holiness wakes readers from spiritual slumber and uncages the living God so often domesticated in our time.	278	May 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685342.The_Beauty_of_Gods_Holiness
