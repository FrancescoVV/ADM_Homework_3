Last Days of Summer		Steve Kluger	4.38	4437	800	A contemporary American classic â€” a poignant and hilarious tale of baseball, hero worship, eccentric behavior, and unlikely friendship Last Days of Summer is the story of Joey Margolis, neighborhood punching bag, growing up goofy and mostly fatherless in Brooklyn in the early 1940s. A boy looking for a hero, Joey decides to latch on to Charlie Banks, the all-star third basemen for the New York Giants. But Joey's chosen champion doesn't exactly welcome the extreme attention of a persistent young fan with an overactive imagination. Then again, this strange, needy kid might be exactly what Banks needs.	368	June 1st 1998		Brooklyn, New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113773.Last_Days_of_Summer
