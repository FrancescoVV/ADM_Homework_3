Now that Ramona is eight, she can go to a new school with a new teacher and ride the bus all by herself. But after school she has to stay with Grandmother Kemp and be nice to that bratty little Willa Jean until Beezus�who's tempermental enough to ruin anyone's day�comes to take her home. Life isn't as easy for Ramona as it used to be.
