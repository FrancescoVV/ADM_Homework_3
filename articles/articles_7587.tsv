Branded by Fire	Psy-Changeling #6	Nalini Singh	4.28	28417	1368	Though DarkRiver sentinel Mercy is feeling the pressure to mate, she savagely resists when Riley Kincaid, a lieutenant from the SnowDancer pack, tries to possess her. The problem is not simply that he pushes her buttons; the problem is that he's a wolf, she's a cat, and they're both used to being on top. But when a brilliant changeling researcher is kidnapped from DarkRiver territory, Mercy and Riley must work together to track the young man - before his shadowy captors decide he's no longer useful. Along the way, the two dominants may find that submitting to one another uncovers not just a deadly conspiracy, but a passion so raw that it'll leave them both branded by fire...	345	July 7th 2009	Sascha Duncan, Lucas Hunter, Brenna Shane Kincaid, Judd Lauren, Mercy Smith, Andrew Liam Kincaid, Riley Aedan Kincaid, Hawke Snow, Sienna Lauren, Nikita Duncan, Bastien Smith, Kaleb Krycheck, Sage Smith, Grey Smith, Michael Smith, Lia Smith		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5628753-branded-by-fire
