Magic Hour		Kristin Hannah	4.12	57951	4498	Dr. Julia Cates was one of the country's preeminent child psychiatrists until a shocking tragedy ruined her career. Retreating to her small western Washington hometown, Julia meets an extraordinary six-year-old girl who has inexplicably emerged from the deep woods nearbyâ€”a child locked in a world of unimaginable fear and isolation. To Julia, nothing is more important than saving the girl she now calls Alice. But Julia will need help from others, including the sister she barely knows and a handsome doctor with secrets of his own. What follows will test the limits of Julia's faith and strength, as she struggles to find a home for Alice . . . and for herself.	451	2006	Julia Cates, Max Cerrasin	Rain Valley, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1470232.Magic_Hour
