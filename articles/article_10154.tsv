A Bride Most Begrudging		Deeanne Gist	3.97	12738	899	Any ship arriving from England means good news for Virginia colony farmers. The "tobacco brides" would be on board--eligible women seeking a better life in America, bartered for with barrels of tobacco from the fields. Drew O'Connor isn't stirred by news of a ship full of brides. Still broken-hearted from the loss of his beloved, he only wants a maid to tend his house and care for his young sister. What he ends up with is a wife—a feisty redhead who claims she is Lady Constance Morrow, daughter of an Earl, brought to America against her will. And she wants to go straight back to England as soon as she can. She hasn't the foggiest notion how to cook, dares to argue with her poor husband, and spends more time working on mathematical equations than housework. What kind of a wife is that ? Drew's Christian forbearance is in for some testing. Headstrong and intelligent, deeply moral but incredibly enticing, Constance turns what was supposed to be a marriage of convenience into something most inconvenient, indeed.	347	January 1st 2005	Drew O’Connor, Lady Constance Morrow, Andrew Joseph O'connor, Master Josh, Constance Caroline Morrow, Goodman Emmett, Mr. Meanie, Caskie, Granny Apperson, Woodrum	Virginia Colony (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324022.A_Bride_Most_Begrudging
