Hazard Zone	Mack Bolan the Executioner #395	Don Pendleton, Russell Davis	4.17	18	0	A luxury Jamaican tourist resort turns into a death trap when a vacationing American senator's daughter is murdered. When her body is then used to unleash chemical warfare on the U.S., it's clear this wasn't just a random crime. It was a message—and Mack Bolan intends to respond. Tracking the bioterrorist behind the gruesome attack back to the Jamaican ghettos quickly turns into a deadly chase. Bolan soon finds himself the target of the island's most lethal gang. But they aren't the only ones prepared to kill to protect their secrets. There is another high-powered operator in the game, and the Executioner is determined to take him out—even if it means bringing the battle back to Washington.	192	January 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12742913-hazard-zone
