The Winds of War	The Henry Family #1	Herman Wouk	4.36	51695	1537	Like no other masterpiece of historical fiction, Herman Wouk's sweeping epic of World War II is the great novel of America's Greatest Generation. Wouk's spellbinding narrative captures the tide of global events, as well as all the drama, romance, heroism, and tragedy of World War II, as it immerses us in the lives of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom. The Winds of War and its sequel War and Remembrance stand as the crowning achievement of one of America's most celebrated storytellers.	896	November 15th 1971	Joseph Stalin, Hermann GÃ¶ring, Benito Mussolini, Victor Henry, Byron Henry, Eleanor Roosevelt, Aaron Jastrow, Natalie Jastrow, Rhoda Henry, Warren Henry, Franklin D.
