Aphrodite the Diva	Goddess Girls #6	Joan Holub, Suzanne Williams, Glen Hanson	4.28	2826	101	These classic myths from the Greek pantheon are given a modern twist that contemporary tweens can relate to, from dealing with bullies like Medusa to a first crush on an unlikely boy. Goddess Girls follows four goddesses-in-training – Athena, Persephone, Aphrodite, and Artemis – as they navigate the ins and outs of divine social life at Mount Olympus Academy, where the most priviledged gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon hone their mythical skills. In book 6, an exchange student from Egypt, Isis, is encroaching on Aphrodite's match-making turf. Will she also edge Aphrodite out of her group of friends?	277	August 9th 2011	Aphrodite		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9764206-aphrodite-the-diva
