Bloodfire Quest	The Dark Legacy of Shannara #2	Terry Brooks	4.04	5791	326	For the first time in his career, Terry will be publishing a book every six months from the start to end of this series: here is the second in a brand-new trilogy, following The Wards of Faerie , in the New York Times bestselling Shannara universe! Long ago, many dangerous creatures were locked behind a magical barrier, bringing peace and prosperity to the land. But now those barriers are eroding, and generations of embittered prisoners are about to escape. War seems inevitable . . . unless a few brave souls can stem the tide. While some venture into the forbidden lands, others must undertake a perilous questâ€”a quest whose success will mean the death of a young girl who has barely even begun to live, but whose failure will have unimaginable consequences. From riveting start to cliffhanger ending, this is an epic for the ages!	368	October 16th 2012	The Ellcrys, Aphenglow Elessedil, Khyber Elessedil, Ard Rhys, Railing Ohmsford, Redden Ohmsford, Arlingfant Elessedil, Cymrian, Edinja Orle, Telsa Dart, Tael Riverine, Straken Lord, Mirai	The Four Lands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15743703-bloodfire-quest
