Problem Solving in Data Structures & Algorithms Using Python: Programming Interview Guide		Hemant Jain	4.70	10	1	This book is about the usage of Data Structures and Algorithms in computer programming. https://github.com/Hemant-Jain-Author... Designing an efficient algorithm to solve a computer science problem is a skill of Computer programmer. This is the skill which tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe and many others are looking for in an interview. This book assumes that you are a Python language developer. You are not an expert in Python language, but you are well familiar with concepts of references, functions, lists and recursion. In the start of this book, we will be revising the Python language fundamentals. We will be looking into some of the problems in arrays and recursion too. Then in the coming chapter, we will be looking into complexity analysis. Then will look into the various data structures and their algorithms. We will be looking into a Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Heap, Hash Table and Graphs. We will be looking into Sorting & Searching techniques. Then we will be looking into algorithm analysis, we will be looking into Brute Force algorithms, Greedy algorithms, Divide & Conquer algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Reduction, and Backtracking. In the end, we will be looking into System Design, which will give a systematic approach for solving the design problems in an Interview.	413	January 18th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33587152-problem-solving-in-data-structures-algorithms-using-python
