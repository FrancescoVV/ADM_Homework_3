Lethal Rider	Lords of Deliverance #3	Larissa Ione	4.37	16501	852	They're here. They ride. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Born of a match between good and evil, four siblings stand between hell's minions and everything they want to destroy. They are the Lords of Deliverance , and they have the power to ward off Doomsday...or let it ride... LETHAL RIDER Thanatos, the most deadly Horseman of the Apocalypse, has endured thousands of years of celibacy to prevent the end of days. But just one night with the wickedly sexy Aegis Guardian, Regan Cooper, shatters centuries of resolve. Yet their passion comes with a price. And Thanatos must face a truth more terrifying than an apocalypse-he's about to become a father. Demon-slayer Regan Cooper never imagined herself the maternal type, but with the fate of the world hanging in the balance she had no choice but to seduce Thanatos and bear his child. Now, as the final battle draws closer and his rage at being betrayed is overshadowed by an undeniable passion for the mother of his child, Thanatos has a life-shattering realization: To save the world, he must sacrifice the only thing he's ever wanted-a family.	464	November 22nd 2011	Shade, Eidolon, Wraith (Demonica series), Conall Dearghul, Ares "War", Kynan Morgan, Reaver, Limos, Reseph, Thanatos (Horseman of the Apocalypse), Harvester, Regan Cooper		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11512712-lethal-rider
