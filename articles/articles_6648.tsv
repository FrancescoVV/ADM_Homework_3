The Wonderful Adventures of Nils	Nils Holgersson #1	Selma Lagerlöf, Thea Kliros, Velma Swanston Howard	4.04	9617	364	Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1909 — the first woman to be so honored — Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf (1858–1940) was a gifted storyteller whose writings were often tinged with the supernatural and rooted in the sagas and legends of her homeland. She secured her reputation as a children's-book author with The Wonderful Adventures of Nils , long considered a masterpiece of children's literature. Written at the request of Swedish school authorities and first published in 1906, it is the enchanting and remarkably original tale of Nils Holgersson, a mischievous boy of 14 who is changed by an elf into a tiny being able to understand the speech of birds and animals. Brilliantly weaving fact and fiction into a breathtaking and beautiful fable, the story recounts Nils's adventures as he is transported over the countryside on the back of a goose. From this vantage point, Nils witnesses a host of events that provide young readers with an abundance of information about nature, geography, folklore, animal life, and more. Reset in easy-to-read type and enhanced with 10 new illustrations, this inexpensive, unabridged edition will bring new generations of readers under the magical spell of a timeless classic.	240	1906	Dunfin, Clement Larsson, Smirre Fox, Morten Goosey-gander, Thumbietot, Grayskin, Bataki, Takern, Crawlie, Lake Mälar, Kebnekaise, Rosenbom, Mother Bear	Västra Vemmenhög (Sweden), Sweden, Karlskrona (Sweden), Ottenby , 1898 (Sweden), Ottenby (Sweden)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/771287.The_Wonderful_Adventures_of_Nils
