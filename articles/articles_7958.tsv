The Shaman's Apprentice (Jovai Book 1)		B. Muze	4.22	41	22	Her master calls her shaman. Her people call her witch. Gods, spirits, and demons won't stop calling. In this first book of B. Muze's epic primitive fantasy, Yaku Shaman believes he has at last found his apprenticeâ€”a girl who talks with ghosts, spirits and gods with equal ease. Unfortunately, his people refuse to accept her. The shaman forces Jovai to sacrifice every hope of a normal life, until the people, unaware of the dangers threatening them, revolt.	404	December 30th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37786729-the-shaman-s-apprentice
