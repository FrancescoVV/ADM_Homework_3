BZRK	BZRK #1	Michael  Grant	3.68	8047	975	Set in the near future, BZRK is the story of a war for control of the human mind. Charles and Benjamin Armstrong, conjoined twins and owners of the Armstrong Fancy Gifts Corporation, have a goal: to turn the world into their vision of utopia. No wars, no conflict, no hunger. And no free will. Opposing them is a guerrilla group of teens, code name BZRK, who are fighting to protect the right to be messed up, to be human. This is no ordinary war, though. Weapons are deployed on the nano-level. The battleground is the human brain. And there are no stalemates here: Itâ€™s victory . . . or madness. BZRK unfolds with hurricane force around core themes of conspiracy and mystery, insanity and changing realities, engagement and empowerment, and the larger impact of personal choice. Which side would you choose? How far would you go to win?	391	February 28th 2012	Charles Armstrong, Benjamin Armstrong, Sadie McLure, Grey McLure, Karl Burnofsky, Noah Cotton, Michael Ford (Vincent), Wilkes, Caligula, Nijinsky, Anthony Elder (Bug Man)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642246-bzrk
