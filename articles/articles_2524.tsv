Magic Slays	Kate Daniels #5	Ilona Andrews	4.41	64081	2922	Plagued by a war between magic and technology, Atlanta has never been so deadly. Good thing Kate Daniels is on the job. Kate Daniels may have quit the Order of Merciful Aid, but she’s still knee-deep in paranormal problems. Or she would be if she could get someone to hire her. Starting her own business has been more challenging than she thought it would be—now that the Order is disparaging her good name, and many potential clients are afraid of getting on the bad side of the Beast Lord, who just happens to be Kate’s mate. So when Atlanta’s premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. Turns out this is not an isolated incident, and Kate needs to get to the bottom of it—fast, or the city and everyone dear to her might pay the ultimate price.	308	April 25th 2011	Kate Daniels, Curran Lennart, Beatrice "Aunt B", Derek Gaunt, Jim Shrapshire, Saiman, Dr. George Doolittle, Andrea Nash, Raphael Medrano, Roman Semionovich, Mahon Delany, Ghastek, Rowena (People), Julie Olsen, Ascanio Ferara, Barabas Gilliam, Evdokia Ivanovna	Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8559047-magic-slays
