Innocent Erendira and Other Stories		Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa	3.91	14589	810	"The stories are rich and startling in their matter and confident in their manner....They are--the word cannot be avoided--magical."--John Updike, The New Yorker This collection of fiction, representing some of García Márquez's earlier work, includes eleven short stories and a novella, Innocent Eréndira, in which a young girl who dreams of freedom cannot escape the reach of her vicious and avaricious grandmother. "Garcí­a Márquez's fictional universe has the same staggeringly gratifying density and texture as Proust's Faubourg Saint-Germain and Joyce's Dublin....Arguably the best of the Latin Americans."--Martin Kaplan, The New Republic "It is the genius of the mature Garcí­a Márquez that fatalism and possibility somehow coexist, that dreams redeem, that there is laughter even in death.'--John Leonard, New York Times	192	April 30th 1972			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31741.Innocent_Erendira_and_Other_Stories
