With Pythons & Head-Hunters in Borneo		Brian Row McNamee	3.86	7	0	Award-Winner in the Travel-Cultural category of the National Best Books 2008 Awards (sponsored by USA Book News), With Pythons & Head-Hunters in Borneo, The Quest For Mount Tiban, is a riveting piece of adventure writing . This is the thrilling narrative of the 2003 & 2006 journeys deep into the heart of Borneo, made by the author and his remarkable indigenous guides. This is a classic travel narrative - long river voyages and foot trekking expeditions with the ultimate goal of scaling the mysterious & allegedly haunted Mount Tiban located near the jungly border between Malaysia and Indonesia. Following in the footsteps of comedy-adventure writer Redmond O'Hanlon's 1983 expedition, the author braves dangerous rivers, deadly disease, pestiferous insects, leeches, wild animals, venomous snakes & pythons in an attempt to become the first Westerner to scale Mount Tiban since naturalist-explorer Eric Mjoberg in 1925. Brilliantly tying together his own intrepid expeditions with fascinating quotes from famous historic predecessors to include: White Rajahs, District Officers, naturalist-scientists, military soldiers, writers, missionaries, and explorers, the author takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of emotions while putting together a uniquely complete history of Sarawak, Borneo.	248	August 5th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5972820-with-pythons-head-hunters-in-borneo
