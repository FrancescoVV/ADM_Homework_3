Adulthood Is a Myth	Sarah's Scribbles #1	Sarah Andersen	4.12	104343	6579	Are you a special snowflake? Do you enjoy networking to advance your career? Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? Ugh. Please go away. This book is for the rest of us. These comics document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet, the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas, and wondering when, exactly, this adulthood thing begins. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life.	112	March 8th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25855506-adulthood-is-a-myth
