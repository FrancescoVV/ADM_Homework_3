The Prince and the Pauper		Mark Twain, Everett H. Emerson	3.86	107129	2149	This treasured historical satire, played out in two very different socioeconomic worlds of 16th-century England, centers around the lives of two boys born in London on the same day: Edward, Prince of Wales and Tom Canty, a street beggar. During a chance encounter, the two realize they are identical and, as a lark, decide to exchange clothes and roles--a situation that briefly, but drastically, alters the lives of both youngsters. The Prince, dressed in rags, wanders about the city's boisterous neighborhoods among the lower classes and endures a series of hardships; meanwhile, poor Tom, now living with the royals, is constantly filled with the dread of being discovered for who and what he really is.	240	1881	Tom Canty, Prince Edward Tudor, Miles Hendon, Hugh Hendon, Lady Elizabeth, John Canty	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62446.The_Prince_and_the_Pauper
