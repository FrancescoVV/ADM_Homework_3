Rewire The Black Mind To Prosper: Common Sense Approach to Self-Empowerment		LaTonya Page-Balkcom	3.60	5	2	“Rewire the Black mind to Prosper” was written as an aide to rapid comprehension of essential common-sense ideas, to give Africans in America, perhaps of all levels of Academia, an opportunity to understand how to control situations and gain an edge over a mentality of defeat in an unjust society, in efforts to gain understanding of and or perhaps power over any situation in all areas of Life. In retrospect, there are no truly original ideas to be had in this world. Many ideas come to us and are formulated from prior influences or knowledge gained from others, as any Book that was written over the course of thousands of years… “Rewire the Black Mind to Prosper” perhaps, will bring a new common-sense idea to help an oppressed Melanated People to learn how to maneuver as a God and perhaps gain Self- Empowerment in Society.	132	July 12th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35829046-rewire-the-black-mind-to-prosper
