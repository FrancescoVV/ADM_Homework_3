Philosophy and the Adventure of the Virtual: Bergson and the Time of Life		Keith Ansell-Pearson	4.24	17	2	With the development of new technologies and the Internet, the notion of the virtual has grown increasingly important. In this lucid collection of essays, Pearson bridges the continental-analytic divide in philosophy, bringing the virtual to centre stage and arguing its importance for re-thinking such central philosophical questions as time and life. Drawing on philosophers from Bergson, Kant and Nietzsche to Proust, Russell, Dennett and Badiou, Pearson examines the limits of continuity, explores relativity, and offers a concept of creative evolution.	246	September 27th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115738.Philosophy_and_the_Adventure_of_the_Virtual
