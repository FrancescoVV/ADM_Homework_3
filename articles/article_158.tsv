Atonement		Ian McEwan	3.91	441187	17379	Ian McEwan’s symphonic novel of love and war, childhood and class, guilt and forgiveness provides all the satisfaction of a brilliant narrative and the provocation we have come to expect from this master of English prose. On a hot summer day in 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses the flirtation between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant. But Briony’s incomplete grasp of adult motives and her precocious imagination bring about a crime that will change all their lives, a crime whose repercussions Atonement follows through the chaos and carnage of World War II and into the close of the twentieth century.	351	2001	Briony Tallis, Emily Tallis, Cecilia Tallis, Leon Tallis, Lola Quincey, Jackson Quincey, Pierrot Quincey, Paul Marshall, Robbie Turner	England, France, London, England (United Kingdom), United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6867.Atonement
