The Woodlanders		Thomas Hardy, Patricia Ingham	3.86	14242	572	In this classically simple tale of the disastrous impact of outside life on a secluded community in Dorset, now in a new edition, Hardy narrates the rivalry for the hand of Grace Melbury between a simple and loyal woodlander and an exotic and sophisticated outsider. Betrayal, adultery, disillusion, and moral compromise are all worked out in a setting evoked as both beautiful and treacherous. The Woodlanders , with its thematic portrayal of the role of social class, gender, and evolutionary survival, as well as its insights into the capacities and limitations of language, exhibits Hardy's acute awareness of his era's most troubling dilemmas.	420	1887	Giles Winterbourne, Grace Melbury, Marty South, Edred Fitzpiers, Mrs. Charmond	Little Hintock, Dorset, England, Dorset, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341281.The_Woodlanders
