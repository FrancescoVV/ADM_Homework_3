The Lady Elizabeth	Elizabeth I #1	Alison Weir	3.97	25356	1271	Following the tremendous success of her first novel, Innocent Traitor, which recounted the riveting tale of the doomed Lady Jane Grey, acclaimed historian and New York Times bestselling author Alison Weir turns her masterly storytelling skills to the early life of young Elizabeth Tudor, who would grow up to become England's most intriguing and powerful queen. Even at age two, Elizabeth is keenly aware that people in the court of her father, King Henry VIII, have stopped referring to her as "Lady Princess" and now call her "the Lady Elizabeth." Before she is three, she learns of the tragic fate that has befallen her mother, the enigmatic and seductive Anne Boleyn, and that she herself has been declared illegitimate, an injustice that will haunt her.	483	April 29th 2008	Lady Jane Grey, Henry VIII of England, Kat Ashley, Catherine Parr, Elizabeth I of England, Edward VI of England, Mary I of England	Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England (United Kingdom), Tower of London, London, England (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933181.The_Lady_Elizabeth
