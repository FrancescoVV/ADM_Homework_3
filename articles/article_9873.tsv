Her boyfriend, Zak, can't help, and everything keeps getting louder and more intense. Then Lenzi meets Alden, the boy from her dreams, who reveals that she's a reincarnated Speaker - someone who can talk to and help lost souls - and that he has been her Protector for centuries. Now Lenzi must choose between her life with Zak and the life she is destined to lead with Alden. But time is running out: a malevolent spirit is out to destroy Lenzi, and he will kill her if she doesn't make a decision soon.	336	December 8th 2011	Lenzi, Alden, Zak	Galveston, Texas (United States), Houston, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13584415-shattered-souls
