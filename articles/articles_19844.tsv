Photo Finish	Saddle Club #43	Bonnie Bryant	3.85	157	4	It's the invitation of a lifetime. When Judy Barker, the Pine Hollow veterinarian, offers Lisa a chance to visit the stables at the racetrack, Lisa jumps at the opportunity. She's been working on her skills as a photographer, and she'd love to take pictures of some of the Thoroughbreds -- especially a beautiful stallion that's training for the upcoming Preakness race. Then Lisa, Carole, and Stevie uncover what could be a plot to make the stallion so sick he can't run. Will Lisa's photographs help the girls bring a high-stakes schemer to justice?	144	March 1st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2110492.Photo_Finish
