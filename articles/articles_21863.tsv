The Key of Life; A Metaphysical Investigation		Randolph J. Rogers	4.50	40	10	"The Key of Life" is a true story about who we are, why we are here and how we are all connected. This thought-provoking book inspires readers to interpret the synchronicities in their own lives, as author Randy Rogers takes you along on his riveting journey investigating past lives, present events and reincarnation. Randy proves that "ordinary" people can experience the extraordinary when they open themselves to the possibilities. What if you could clearly read the "signs" that are constantly surrounding us and in the process unlock the meaning of life - present, past and future? "The Key of Life" will open that door for you!	296	October 23rd 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6944881-the-key-of-life-a-metaphysical-investigation
