City of Stars	Stravaganza #2	Mary Hoffman	4.02	7387	197	Dreaming of a city with flying horses was one thing... But coming face to face with someone she knew to be dead - that was something else again. Georgia would love nothing more than to ride horses every day and avoid her annoying stepbrother at all costs. But she could never have guessed that a tiny, antique winged horse figurine would be the key to her escape to another world and another time. When Georgia arrives in a sixteenth-century city called Remora, she is plunged into a dangerous and treacherous world of horse-racing, family honour and deadly rivalry. And there, as a new Stravagante, Georgia will have a dramatic and extraordinary role to play...	459	September 3rd 2003	Russell, Maura, Luciano Crinamorte, Georgia O'Grady, Duke Niccolo di Chimici, Arianna Rossi, Rodolfo Rossi, Silvia Bellini, Francesca di Chimici, Gaetano di Chimici, Enrico Poggi, Beatrice di Chimici, Rinaldo di Chimici, Vicky Mulholland, William Dethridge, Paolo, Cesare Montalbani, Falco di Chimici, Aurelio, Raffaella, Mortimer Goldsmith, Ralph		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250026.City_of_Stars
