The Sky is Not Blue		Sandie Zand	4.50	8	3	A dark tale of oppressive friendship and the fallibility of memory. Photographer Chrissy returns home for the first time in 34 years, unsure if she caused the death of her best friend, Pat, in 1973. Her parents now dead, she plans to sell up quickly and leave. But the past returns, unbidden and cloudy. Elderly neighbour Alice and childhood friend Marion seem unable or unwilling to fill in the gaps. And Spencer, the nihilistic lover she’d assumed dead, is alive and producing commercial art for tourists. Memories of events leading up to Pat’s death must be recovered if Chrissy is to find out what it is she's been running from all those years.
