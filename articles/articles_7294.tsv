Beautiful Beginning	Beautiful Bastard #3.5	Christina Lauren	4.21	27032	1460	Back when not being able to stand each other also meant not being able to keep their hands off each other in Beautiful Bastard , neither Bennett nor Chloe could have seen this day coming. An exasperated bride who just wants to elope. A determined groom whose only focus is getting to the wedding night. And—of course—a whole lot of name calling.	208	November 18th 2013	Chloe Mills, Bennett Ryan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17831619-beautiful-beginning
