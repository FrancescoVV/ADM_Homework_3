Scorch	Croak #2	Gina Damico	4.05	4094	487	Sixteen-year-old Lex Bartleby is a teenage grim reaper with the bizarre ability to damn souls. That makes her pretty scary, even to fellow Grims. But after inadvertently transferring her ability to Zara, a murderous outlaw, Lex is a pariah in Croak, the little town she calls home. To escape the townspeople’s wrath, she and her friends embark on a wild road trip to DeMyse. Though this sparkling desert oasis is full of luxuries and amusements, it feels like a prison to Lex. Her best chance at escape would be to stop Zara once and for all—but how can she do that from DeMyse, where the Grims seem mysteriously oblivious to Zara’s killing spree?	332	September 25th 2012	Edgar Allan Poe, Pip, Lex Bartleby, Uncle Mort, Zara, Driggs, Cordy Bartleby, Bang, Elysia, Ferbus		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13316241-scorch
