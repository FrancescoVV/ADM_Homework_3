The Last World		Christoph Ransmayr, John E. Woods	3.83	858	71	Acclaimed as a modern masterpiece and as one of the most important novels of our time. The Last World is the story of a young man's quest for the exiled poet Ovid and the masterwork he has consigned to the flames. Ransmayr has created a visionary landscape, a transformed place where the ancient world meets the twentieth century. A metaphysical thriller both compelling and profound. The Last World draws the reader into a universe governed by the power of mythology, a world of decay on the brink of apocalypse. A novel about exile, censorship, and the destruction of the planet, this is a cultural and political fable that is blazingly topical, yet timeless.	246	1988		Constanta (Romania), Rome (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182587.The_Last_World
