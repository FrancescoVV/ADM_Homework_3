The Last Night: Anti-Work, Atheism, Adventure		Federico Campagna	3.47	58	10	Our secular society seems to have finally found its new God: Work. As technological progress makes human labor superfluous, and over-production destroys both the economy and the planet, Work remains stronger than ever as a mantra of universal submission. This book develops a fully-fledged theory of radical atheism, advocating a disrespectful, opportunist squandering of obedience. By replacing hope and faith with adventure, The Last Night of our lives might finally become the first morning of an autonomous future.	106	October 25th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18357651-the-last-night
