One Good Knight	Five Hundred Kingdoms #2	Mercedes Lackey	3.85	10290	482	When a dragon storms the castle, what should a (virgin) princess do? Why, turn to her studies, of course! But nothing practical-minded Princess Andromeda of Acadia finds gives a definitive solution. The only Traditional answer, though, is soothing the marauding dragon by a virgin sacrifice. Things are going fairly smoothly with the lottery--except for the women chosen, of course--until Princess Andromeda herself is picked! But facing down the dragon doesn't go quite as planned, and now, with the help of her Champion, Sir George, Andromeda searches for the dragon's lair. But even-- especially --in the Five Hundred Kingdoms, bucking Tradition isn't easy. It takes the strongest of wills, knowledge, quick wits and a refusal to give up, no matter what happens along the way....	393	March 1st 2006	Princess Andromeda, Queen Cassiopeia, Solon Adacritus, Loremaster Periapt	Acadia, Five Hundred Kingdoms	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13978.One_Good_Knight
