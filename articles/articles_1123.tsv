The French Lieutenant's Woman		John Fowles	3.87	46796	1689	The scene is the village of Lyme Regis on Dorset's Lyme Bay..."the largest bite from the underside of England's out-stretched southwestern leg." The major characters in the love-intrigue triangle are Charles Smithson, 32, a gentleman of independent means & vaguely scientific bent; his fianc√©e, Ernestina Freeman, a pretty heiress daughter of a wealthy & pompous dry goods merchant; & Sarah Woodruff, mysterious & fascinating...deserted after a brief affair with a French naval officer a short time before the story begins. Obsessed with an irresistible fascination for the enigmatic Sarah, Charles is hurtled by a moment of consummated lust to the brink of the existential void. Duty dictates that his engagement to Tina must be broken as he goes forth once again to seek the woman who has captured his Victorian soul & gentleman's heart.	470	1969	Sarah Woodruff, Charles Smithson, Ernestina Freeman, Sam Farrow, Dr Grogan	Lyme Regis, England (United Kingdom), Exeter, Devon, England, London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56034.The_French_Lieutenant_s_Woman
