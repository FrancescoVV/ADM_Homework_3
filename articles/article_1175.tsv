The Pandarus File		Kyle Keyes	4.43	2867	17	Helena Hollister was a New York City gold digger who latched onto her father-in-law's fortune by seducing a Hobbs Creek 24 yr old who suffered from motor slowness. Helena got away with murder and the money, while two backwoods lawmen failed to unravel the mystery of who killed Elmer Kane. The case went unsolved from 1958 until early in the cyberspace age, when Helena Hollister surfaced in Right Bank, Paris as Anna Ward.	348	January 8th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13328554-the-pandarus-file
