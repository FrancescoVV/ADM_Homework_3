Heart's Blood		Juliet Marillier	4.09	14286	1442	Whistling Tor is a place of secrets, a mysterious, wooded hill housing the crumbling fortress of a chieftain whose name is spoken throughout the district in tones of revulsion and bitterness. A curse lies over Anluan's family and his people; those woods hold a perilous force whose every whisper threatens doom. For young scribe Caitrin it is a safe haven. This place where nobody else is prepared to go seems exactly what she needs, for Caitrin is fleeing her own demons. As Caitrin comes to know Anluan and his home in more depth she realizes that it is only through her love and determination that the curse can be broken and Anluan and his people set free.	405	October 2nd 2009	Tomás Carreño, Aislinn, Irial, Magnus, Anluan, Caitrin, Rioghan, Cillian, Ita, Eichri, Mella, Nechtan, Olcan, Cathaír, Líoch, Orna, Maraid, Gearróg, Conan (Heart's Blood)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6278019-heart-s-blood
