Eeny Meeny	Helen Grace #1	M.J. Arlidge	3.92	32650	3431	The "dark, twisted, thought-provoking" (#1 New York Times bestseller Tami Hoag) international bestseller—first in the new series featuring Detective Helen Grace. Two people are abducted, imprisoned, and left with a gun. As hunger and thirst set in, only one walks away alive. It’s a game more twisted than any Detective Helen Grace has ever seen. If she hadn’t spoken with the shattered survivors herself, she almost wouldn’t believe them. Helen is familiar with the dark sides of human nature, including her own, but this case—with its seemingly random victims—has her baffled. But as more people go missing, nothing will be more terrifying than when it all starts making sense....	395	2014	Mark Fuller, Helen Grace, Charlene 'Charlie' Brooks	Southampton, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398806-eeny-meeny
