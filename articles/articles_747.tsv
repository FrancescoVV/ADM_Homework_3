But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.	355	April 15th 2014	Josh, Kitty, Margot, Lara Jean, Peter Kavinsky	Charlottesville, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15749186-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before
