Smoking in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson		Alistair Owen	4.19	134	16	From Withnail and I to Thomas Penman, the inimitable, outrageous and unforgettable writer and director in conversation... 'I've sometimes thought in the dead of night, "Look at your life, Bruce, rip out the writing, and with all these boiling frustrations and opinions what would you be?" I'd be in trouble, wouldn't I? Or I'd be in jail...' Hard-talking, boisterous, frank and forthright, Bruce Robinson reveals to Alistair Owen the truth about his work and life in a series of exclusive interviews. Talking candidly about his entire career; his acting, writing and directing, and the many tussles he has faced with Hollywood moguls, this is Bruce Robinson as you've never seen or heard him before. 'The most purely likeable book about cinema I have ever read. Robinson talks about his profession in a way that is astonishingly clear-headed, funny and wise' David Hare, Guardian, Books of the Year	276	November 20th 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/309455.Smoking_in_Bed
