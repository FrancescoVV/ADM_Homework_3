Love and Ghost Letters		Chantel Acevedo	3.84	105	16	On the day she is born, Josefina Navarro's nursemaid foretells misfortune. But for the young socialite in pre-Castro Cuba, her life in Havana with her Sergeant of police father is idyllic. That is, until she falls in love with Lorenzo, a penniless man who takes her away to the impoverished town of El Cotorro, and her father disowns her. Josefina comes to wish her father dead but regrets it after the Sergeant is assumed killed in a student-led riot. One day, mysterious letters from the Sergeant begin to arrive, telling her the truth about his past. The ghostly letters become her link to love. Set in Miami and Cuba and covering nearly fifty years of that island's history, Love and Ghost Letters unfolds the lives of the members of the Navarro-Concepci√≥n families in the patterns and permutations of memory, and conjures a Cuban setting that evokes mysticism and magic.	310	September 1st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/565701.Love_and_Ghost_Letters
