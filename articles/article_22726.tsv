Wildlife	Wildlife #1	Jeff Menapace	4.01	1818	208	In the Everglades, there are sights that should never be seen… Deep in the Florida Everglades, a tragic accident has ignited a deadly feud between two families. Meanwhile, a young writer, his girlfriend and her family take a boat ride into the isolated wilds of the Everglades for research on a new book, only to become unwitting witnesses to a brutal crime. Now, as night falls, forced to travel on foot, they must flee through the treacherous wilderness while desperately avoiding the deadly wildlife—and the far more lethal human predators that are hunting them.	206	April 7th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25322556-wildlife
