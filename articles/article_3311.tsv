The protagonist of The Running Man, Ben Richards, is quick to realize this as he watches his daughter, Cathy, grow more sick by the day and tread closer and closer to death. Desperate for money to pay Cathyâ€™s medical bills, Ben enlists himself in a true reality style game show where the objective is to merely stay alive.	317	May 1st 1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11607.The_Running_Man
