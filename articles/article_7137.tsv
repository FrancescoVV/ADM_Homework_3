Trout Fishing in America / The Pill vs. the Springhill Mine Disaster / In Watermelon Sugar		Richard Brautigan	4.15	9176	419	An omnibus edition of three counterculture classics by Richard Brautigan that embody the spirit of the 1960s. Trout Fishing in America is by turns a hilarious, playful, and melancholy novel that wanders from San Francisco through America's rural waterways; In Watermelon Sugar expresses the mood of a new generation, revealing death as a place where people travel the length of their dreams, rejecting violence and hate; and The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster is a collection of nearly 100 poems, first published in 1968.	400	1967			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12568.Trout_Fishing_in_America_The_Pill_vs_the_Springhill_Mine_Disaster_In_Watermelon_Sugar
