The Choice		Eliyahu M. Goldratt	4.25	584	49	TOC has been successfully applied in almost every area of human endeavor, from industry to healthcare to education. And while Eli Goldratt is indeed a scientist, an educator and a business leader, he is first and foremost a philosopher; some say a genius. He is a thinker who provokes others to do the same. Often characterized as unconventional, and always stimulating--a slayer of sacred cows-- Dr. Goldratt exhorts his readers to examine and reassess their lives and business practices by cultivating a different perspective and a clear new vision. In his latest book, The Choice, Goldratt once again presents his thought provoking approach, this time through a conversation with his daughter Efrat, as he explains to her his fundamental system of beliefs.	173	January 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845427-the-choice
