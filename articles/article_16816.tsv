No one, not even her cold, stern Papa and her Bible spouting sister Emily, can crush her spirits â€” until the day Emily reveals the shattering secret at Lillian's birth. Still Lillian refuses to believe Emily's hateful claim that she is evil, a curse. But when tragedy befalls her best friend Lillian comes to believe Emily's grim words. Meekly, she endures her penance, finding a strange solace in the endless repetition of prayers. Then Papa loses The Meadows in a card game, and Lillian is faced with a new and terrifying prospect.
