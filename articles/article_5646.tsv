The Romance of Tristan and Iseult		Joseph Bédier, Hilaire Belloc	3.63	8757	461	A tale of chivalry and doomed, transcendent love, The Romance of Tristan and Iseult is one of the most resonant works of Western literature, as well as the basis for our enduring idea of romance. The story of the Cornish knight and the Irish princess who meet by deception, fall in love by magic, and pursue that love in defiance of heavenly and earthly law has inspired artists from Matthew Arnold to Richard Wagner. But nowhere has it been retold with greater eloquence and dignity than in Joseph Bédier’s edition, which weaves several medieval sources into a seamless whole, elegantly translated by Hilaire Belloc and Paul Rosenfeld.	205	1170	Iseult, King Mark, Tristan	Lyonesse (United Kingdom), Ireland, Brittany (France), Tintagel, Cornwall (United Kingdom) Cornwall, England, Tintagel, Cornwall (United Kingdom), Cornwall, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587359.The_Romance_of_Tristan_and_Iseult
