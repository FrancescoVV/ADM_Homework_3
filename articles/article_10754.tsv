A Long Fatal Love Chase		Louisa May Alcott	3.66	5917	914	"I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom," cries Rosamond Vivian to her callous grandfather. A brooding stranger seduces her from the remote island onto his yacht. Trapped in a web of intrigue, cruelty, and deceit, she flees to Italy, France, Germany, from Paris garret to mental asylum, from convent to chateau - stalked by obsessed Phillip Tempest. Two years before Little Women , serialized in a magazine under the alias A.M. Barnard in 1866, this was buried among the author's papers over a century.	356	1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/620790.A_Long_Fatal_Love_Chase
