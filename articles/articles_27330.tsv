The Mark of the Horse Lord		Rosemary Sutcliff	4.16	821	95	Phaedrus is a Roman gladiator who has won his freedom. By chance, he is also the exact double of Midir, the Horse Lord, lost King of the Dalriad tribe. To rid the Dalriads of the usurping Queen Liadhan, Phaedrus agrees to a daring pretence -- he will impersonate Midir and become the Horse Lord.	289	1965			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149403.The_Mark_of_the_Horse_Lord
