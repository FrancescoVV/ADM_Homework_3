Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings . Together, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction. Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the sorceress who holds him in her thrall. Young Robb still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. And as opposing forces manoeuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Othersâ€”a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords...	1177	August 8th 2000	Brandon Stark, Catelyn Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Robb Stark, Arya Stark, Jaime Lannister, Joffrey Baratheon, Tywin Lannister, Stannis Baratheon, Melisandre, Davos Seaworth, Lysa Arryn, Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark, Varys, Hodor, Brienne of Tarth, Samwell Tarly, Sandor Clegane, Pyp, Grenn, Tommen Baratheon, Oswell Kettleback, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr, Jon Snow, Cersei Lannister, Jorah Mormont	Westeros, Essos	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62291.A_Storm_of_Swords
