The Vicious Deep	The Vicious Deep #1	Zoraida CÃ³rdova	3.69	3293	480	For Tristan Hart, everything changes with one crashing wave. He was gone for three days. Sucked out to sea in a tidal wave and spit back ashore at Coney Island with no memory of what happened. Now his dreams are haunted by a terrifying silver mermaid with razor-sharp teeth. His best friend Layla is convinced something is wrong. But how can he explain he can sense emotion like never before? How can he explain he's heir to a kingdom he never knew existed? That he's suddenly a pawn in a battle as ancient as the gods. Something happened to him in those three days. He was claimed by the sea...and now it wants him back.	372	May 1st 2012		Coney Island, New York (United States), Brooklyn, New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12246929-the-vicious-deep
