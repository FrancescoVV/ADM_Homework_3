But unlike his four brothers and sisters, Louis can't trumpet joyfully. In fact, he can't even make a sound. And since he can't trumpet his love, the beautiful swan Serena pays absolutely no attention to him. Louis tries everything he can think of to win Serena's affectionâ€”he even goes to school to learn to read and write. But nothing seems to work. Then his father steals him a real brass trumpet.
