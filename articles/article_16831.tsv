The Mikveh Scrolls		Steven G. Lightfoot	4.63	8	2	World renowned archaeologist, Dr. Simon Cross, dedicated his life to unearthing physical evidence to corroborate the people and events of The Bible. For years, Cross fought the skeptics in the academic and scientific communities. And, for years, the irrefutable proof of the historical accuracy of scripture eluded him. Now, thanks to a special team of archaeologists and mind-blowing new technology, Cross is on the verge of a world-changing discovery that will either set humanity ablaze for Christ or accelerate the powers of darkness to destroy mankind. As a holy war heats up in the Holy Land, Cross and his team race to realize their discovery. Will Cross find the proof he seeks? Or, will the demonic forces of evil descend on his team and erase the hope of mankind forever? Author, Steven G. Lightfoot, weaves an exotic tapestry of action, suspense, romance and deep faith in Christ. Drawing from his combat experience as a U.S. Marine officer, his spiritual gifts, and his keen sense of observation, Lightfoot crafts a tale that transports the reader into a world of spiritual conflict and incredible imagery. In The Mikveh Scrolls, the reader does not just read about his characters, but rather builds a relationship with them. The Mikveh Scrolls is contemporary Christian fiction at its best: Full of romance, action, suspense and great spiritual content in the style of Jenkins and LaHaye's best-selling Left Behind series.
