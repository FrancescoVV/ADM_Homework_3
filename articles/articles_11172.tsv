Vanished	Greywalker #4	Kat Richardson	3.90	4660	255	The toughest case yet for Greywalker and P.I. Harper Blaine, "a great heroine" ("New York Times" bestselling author Charlaine Harris), has arrived. Harper Blaine was your average small-time P.I. until she died-for two minutes. Now Harper is a Greywalker-walking the line between the living world and the paranormal realm. And she's discovering that her new abilities are landing her in all sorts of "strange cases." But for Harper, her own case may prove the most difficult to solve. Why did she-as opposed to others with near-death experiences-become a Greywalker? When Harper digs into her own past, she unearths some unpleasant truths about her father's early death as well as a mysterious puzzle. Forced by some very demanding vampires to take on an investigation in London, she soon discovers her present troubles in England are entangled with her dark past back in Seattle-and her ultimate destiny as a Greywalker.	368	August 4th 2009	Harper Blaine, Marsden	England, Seattle, Washington (United States), Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5723653-vanished
