A Dance with Dragons: Dreams and Dust	A Song of Ice and Fire (1-in-2) #9	George R.R. Martin	4.35	24198	944	In the aftermath of a colossal battle, new threats are emerging from every direction. Tyrion Lannister, having killed his father, and wrongfully accused of killing his nephew, King Joffrey, has escaped from King’s Landing with a price on his head. To the north lies the great Wall of ice and stone – a structure only as strong as those guarding it. Eddard Stark's bastard son Jon Snow has been elected 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. But Jon has enemies both inside and beyond the Wall. And in the east Daenerys Targaryen struggles to hold a city built on dreams and dust.	690	July 12th 2011	Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Theon Greyjoy, Arya Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Melisandre, Davos Seaworth, Jon Snow		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13337715-a-dance-with-dragons
