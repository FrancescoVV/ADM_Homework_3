Middlemarch		George Eliot, Michel Faber	3.97	136069	7748	Taking place in the years leading up to the First Reform Bill of 1832, Middlemarch explores nearly every subject of concern to modern life: art, religion, science, politics, self, society, human relationships. Among her characters are some of the most remarkable portraits in English literature: Dorothea Brooke, the heroine, idealistic but naive; Rosamond Vincy, beautiful and egoistic: Edward Casaubon, the dry-as-dust scholar: Tertius Lydgate, the brilliant but morally-flawed physician: the passionate artist Will Ladislaw: and Fred Vincey and Mary Garth, childhood sweethearts whose charming courtship is one of the many humorous elements in the novel's rich comic vein.	904	1871	Dorothea Brooke, Celia Brooke, Will Ladislaw, Mary Garth, Rosamond Vincy, Sir James Chettam, Tertius Lydgate, Peter Featherstone, Edward Casaubon, Caleb Garth, Camden Farebrother, Joshua Rigg, John Raffles, Nicholas Bulstrode, Harriet Bulstrode, Arthur Brooke, Fred Vincy	Midlands, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19089.Middlemarch
