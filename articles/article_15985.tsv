River's End		Nora Roberts	3.99	18569	675	Olivia's parents were among Hollywood's golden couples…until the night a monster came and took her mother away forever. A monster with the face of her father... Sheltered from the truth, an older Olivia only dimly recalls her night of terror—but her recurring nightmares make her realize she must piece together the real story. Assisted by Noah Brady, the son of the police detective who found her cowering in her closet so many years before, she may have her chance. Noah wants to reconstruct the night that has become an infamous part of Hollywood history. He also wants to help Olivia and heal the longing in her lonely heart. But once the door to her past is opened, there's no telling what's waiting on the other side. For somewhere, not too far away, the monster walks again...	443	March 1st 1999	Olivia MacBride, Noah Brady	Los Angeles, California (United States), Olympic Peninsula, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59805.River_s_End
