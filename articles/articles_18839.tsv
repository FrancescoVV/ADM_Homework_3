The Emptiness is not Empty: A Textbook for non-meditators, beginning meditators, curious minds and anyone interested in progress.		Rudolph Kolar, Iori Yoshimura Kolar	5.00	1	1	What the author Rudolph Kolar wants to share in this book is that enlightenment is easy, natural and a physiological necessity just like deep sleep is necessary for perfect healthy bodily function. Having practiced meditation regularly for 40 years he introduces you to the simple secret of human consciousness, gives relevant advice to improve your meditation, and states the necessity of experiencing primal awareness, plainly refreshing the ancient teachings of masters including Patanjali and Kobo Daishi Kukai. A must read for all meditators and non-meditators who want to live fully and happily.	60	February 6th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231190-the-emptiness-is-not-empty
