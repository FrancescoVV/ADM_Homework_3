The Yada Yada Prayer Group	The Yada Yada Prayer Group #1	Neta Jackson	3.99	7690	688	What do an ex-con, a former drug addict, a real estate broker, a college student, and a married mother of two have in common? Nothing, or so I thought. Who would have imagined that God would make a prayer group as mismatched as ours the closest of friends? I almost didn't even go to the Chicago Women's Conference--after all, being thrown together with five hundred strangers wasn't exactly my "comfort zone." But something happened that weekend to make us realize we had to hang together, and the "Yada Yada Prayer Group" was born! When I faced the biggest crisis of my life, God used my newfound Sisters to show me what it means to be just a sinner saved by grace.	385	January 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180739.The_Yada_Yada_Prayer_Group
