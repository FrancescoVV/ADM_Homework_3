Spin the Love		Lisa Terry	4.11	18	13	It was supposed to be a game to heat up their summer—not ruin their lives. Sixteen-year-old Whispy Callahan lands in trouble thicker than Florida’s humidity when she plays a twisted game of Dare. Everything would have been fine if she hadn’t fallen for one of the player’s “targets” along with dredging up buried murderous tendencies. Forget the game—now Whispy needs to find her boyfriend’s murderer, but that might prove difficult since everyone thinks she’s insane. They could be right.	192	September 30th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26848202-spin-the-love
