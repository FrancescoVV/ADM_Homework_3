I Like You Just Because: Thoughts on Friendship		Albert J. Nimeth	4.45	73	8	No one can go through life without friends and still lead a normal and reasonably happy life. We need friends to maintain our peace of mind, to bolster our self-respect and to fulfill human aspirations. Friendship is not a game we play. There is a deep dimension to it that we overlook. There are demands made upon friends which are often unfulfilled. I Like You Just Because explores some of these. It explores the need we have of friends, the risk we take in developing friends, the obligations we assume and the sense of well being we experience in the give and take that friendships demand.	112	January 1st 1970			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/492887.I_Like_You_Just_Because
