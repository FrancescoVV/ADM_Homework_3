Psion Beta	Psion #1	Jacob Gowans	4.13	2684	189	Sammy, a 14-year-old fugitive, accidentally discovers he has the powers of a Psion. Plucked off the streets, he is thrust into the rigorously-disciplined environment of Psion Beta headquarters. As a new Beta, Sammy must hone his newfound abilities using holographic fighting simulations, stealth training missions, and complex war games. His fellow trainees are other kids competing to prove their worth so they can graduate and contribute to the war effort. But the stifling competition at headquarters isolates Sammy from his peers. Learning to use his incredible powers is difficult enough, but when things go horribly wrong on a routine training mission, he must rely on the other Betas to stay alive. The Silent War is at a tipping point; even one boy can be the difference. But to do so, he must survive.	370	December 11th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10779996-psion-beta
