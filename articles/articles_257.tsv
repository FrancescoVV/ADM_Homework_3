The House of the Spirits	Del Valle Family #3	Isabel Allende, Magda Bogin	4.24	191007	8600	In one of the most important and beloved Latin American works of the twentieth century, Isabel Allende weaves a luminous tapestry of three generations of the Trueba family, revealing both triumphs and tragedies. Here is patriarch Esteban, whose wild desires and political machinations are tempered only by his love for his ethereal wife, Clara, a woman touched by an otherworldly hand. Their daughter, Blanca, whose forbidden love for a man Esteban has deemed unworthy infuriates her father, yet will produce his greatest joy: his granddaughter Alba, a beautiful, ambitious girl who will lead the family and their country into a revolutionary future. The House of the Spirits is an enthralling saga that spans decades and lives, twining the personal and the political into an epic novel of love, magic, and fate.	448	January 2nd 1982	Esteban Trueba, Clara del Valle, Férula Trueba, Blanca Trueba, Jaime Trueba, Nicolàs Trueba, Pedro Tercero Garcia, Alba Trueba, Esteban Garcia	Chile	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9328.The_House_of_the_Spirits
