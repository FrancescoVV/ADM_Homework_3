But one night, a girl named Gurl--a leadfoot, an orphan, a nobody--discovers that she can do something much better than fly. She can become invisible. Along with a new friend, a boy named Bug, Gurl begins a quest that takes her on a wild ride through the magical city, all the way to the handsome but lethal Sweetcheeks Grabowski--the gangster who holds the key to Gurl's past . . . and the world's future.	327	March 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/601462.The_Wall_and_the_Wing
