I Fought Like a Girl, and I Won!		Nicole Alyse Dorman	5.00	4	1	“I Fought Like A Girl, And I Won!” is my memoir book of what I encountered having breast cancer. My main goal is to share my journey with other women who have battled cancer, or to be support to women who are newly diagnosed. You can be control of breast cancer; don’t let it be in control of you! My story tells of my hope, faith, and courage. Being a single mom to three children is a challenge; but being a single mom to three children and kicking cancer’s butt takes determination!	87	April 9th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25354575-i-fought-like-a-girl-and-i-won
