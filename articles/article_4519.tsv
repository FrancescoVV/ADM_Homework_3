James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing	James Potter #1	G. Norman Lippert	3.74	26019	2549	What’s it like to be the son of the most famous wizard of all time? James Potter thinks he knows, but as he begins his own adventure at Hogwarts, he discovers just how much of a challenge it really is to live up to the legend of the great Harry Potter. As if it wasn’t enough dealing with the delegates from the American wizarding school and figuring out the mysteriously polite Slytherins, James and his new friends, Ralph and Zane, begin to uncover a secret plot that could pit the Muggle and the Magical worlds against each other in all-out war. Now, with the help of Ted Lupin and his band of merry mischief makers (The Gremlins), James must race to stop a war that could change the world forever. His only hope is to learn the difference between being a hero and being the son of a hero.	391	2007	Mrs. Norris, Mr. Grey, Ron Weasley, Rubeus Hagrid, Minerva McGonagall, Neville Longbottom, George Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Filius Flitwick, Fleur Delacour, Bill Weasley, Horace Slughorn, James Sirius Potter, Teddy Lupin, Bistle, Mundungus Fletcher, Victoire, Thumbs, Steven Metzker, Argus Filch, Cuthbert Binns, Sybill Patricia Trelawney, Grawp, Noah Metzker, Sabrina Hildegard, Damien Damascus, Gennifer, Horace, Frank Tottington, Tabitha Corsica, Nobby, Theodore Hirshall Jackson, Desdemona Delacroix, Benjamin Amadeus Franklyn, Lily Luna Potter, Albus Severus Potter, Rose Weasley, Zane Walker, Ralph Deedle, Petra Morganstern, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger	Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (United Kingdom), Hall of Mysteries, Ministry of Magic (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2548866.James_Potter_and_the_Hall_of_Elders_Crossing
