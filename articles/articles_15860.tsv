Anne McCaffrey's Dragonflight	Anne McCaffrey's Dragonflight #3	Brynne Stephens, Lela Dowling, Cynthia Martin, Fred Vol Tobel, Anne McCaffrey	4.53	9289	10	Anne McCaffrey's beloved science fantasy epic becomes a fully-painted graphic novel. Join Lessa, sole remnant of a noble house, as she comes of age and dares to reclaim her birthright--and battles to save Pern from the deadly silver threadfall that threatens devastation of the planet. The Dragonriders, too long aground, take proudly to the skies, reborn through the hope and love of F'lar and Lessa--but regaining the lost support and faith of the people of Pern may prove more challenging than the Thread's imminent fall. In the conclusion to the spellbinding story of the Dragonriders of Pern, Lessa and golden Ramoth seek the answer to the oldest riddle, the disappearance of the Weyrs, to conquer the greatest danger Pern has ever known.		1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1103140.Anne_McCaffrey_s_Dragonflight_3
