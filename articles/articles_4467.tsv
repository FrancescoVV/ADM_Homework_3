A Rose in Winter		Kathleen E. Woodiwiss	4.16	10123	531	A HEART TORMENTED Erienne's father had given her hand to the richest suitor. She was now Lady Saxton, mistress of a great manor all but ruined by fire, wife to a man whose mysteriously shrouded form aroused fear and pity. Yet even as she fell in love with her adoring husband, Erienne despaired of freeing her heart from the dashingly handsome Yankee who couldn't forget her. The beautiful Erienne, once filled with young dreams of romance, was now a wife and woman ... torn between the two men she loved.	567	December 1982	Christopher Seton, Erienne Fleming	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/896625.A_Rose_in_Winter
