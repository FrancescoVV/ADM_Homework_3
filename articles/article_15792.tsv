Eleven	The Winnie Years #2	Lauren Myracle	3.89	5850	515	Winnie knows that change isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially when it means her best friend, Amanda, might be dropping her for someone else. Throw in a grumpy teenage sister, a cat who gets trapped in the wall, and a crush who has pinkeye, and you've got one big mess--one that Winnie's not going to clean up! Winnie's decided that she's going to remain exactly the same, no matter what the rest of the world does. But every month brings crazy adventures. A lot can change in a year . . .maybe even Winnie.	224	February 9th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357936.Eleven
