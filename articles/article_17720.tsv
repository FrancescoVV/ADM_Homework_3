Beyond Earth	Beyond Earth #1	Arlene Lagos	3.93	43	16	Hidden in the fabric of our own galaxy are five planets, anchored to Earth and thriving with life. Each one unlocks a secret to many destinies that bring seven brave warriors together to fight the ultimate evil set to destroy their existence. Life for Adaminia was ordinary…and she hated ordinary. She always felt she was meant to do more. That opportunity presents itself when she follows a strange sound, gets sucked up into a wind tunnel, and spit out onto a hidden planet. Here she meets Joanie who reveals to her the truth about her real parents, the five hidden planets anchored to Earth, the murdered leaders, the missing heirs, and the role she will play in saving all mankind from extinction.	160	June 7th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13607345-beyond-earth
