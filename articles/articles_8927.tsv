The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things	Virginia Shreves #1	Carolyn Mackler	3.78	26655	1829	Fifteen-year-old Virginia Shreves has a larger-than-average body and a plus-size inferiority complex, especially when she compares herself to her slim, brilliant, picture-perfect family. But that’s before a shocking phone call — and a horrifying allegation — about her rugby-star brother changes everything. With irreverent humor and surprising gravity, Carolyn Mackler creates an endearingly blunt heroine who speaks to every teen who struggles with family expectations, and proves that the most impressive achievement is to be true to yourself.	256	July 14th 2003		New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253106.The_Earth_My_Butt_and_Other_Big_Round_Things
