Pandemonium	Delirium #2	Lauren Oliver	4.05	219877	14739	The old life is dead. But the old Lena is dead too. I buried her. I left her beyond a fence, behind a wall of smoke and ï¬‚ame. In this electrifying follow-up to her acclaimed New York Times bestseller Delirium, Lauren Oliver sets Lena on a dangerous course that hurtles through the unregulated Wilds and into the heart of a growing resistance movement. This riveting, brilliant novel crackles with the fire of fierce defiance, forbidden romance, and the sparks of a revolution about to ignite.	375	February 28th 2012	Magdalena "Lena" Ella Haloway-Tiddle, Julian Fineman, Tack, Raven (Delirium)	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9593911-pandemonium
