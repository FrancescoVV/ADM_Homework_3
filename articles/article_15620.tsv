Island: The Complete Stories		Alistair MacLeod, پ, پژمان طهرانیان	4.20	2244	269	"The genius of his stories is to render his fictional world as timeless." —Colm Tóibín The sixteen exquisitely crafted stories in Island prove Alistair MacLeod to be a master. Quietly, precisely, he has created a body of work that is among the greatest to appear in English in the last fifty years. A book-besotted patriarch releases his only son from the obligations of the sea. A father provokes his young son to violence when he reluctantly sells the family horse. A passionate girl who grows up on a nearly deserted island turns into an ever-wistful woman when her one true love is felled by a logging accident. A dying young man listens to his grandmother play the old Gaelic songs on her ancient violin as they both fend off the inevitable. The events that propel MacLeod's stories convince us of the importance of tradition, the beauty of the landscape, and the necessity of memory.	448	September 1989		Cape Breton, Nova Scotia (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10955240-island
