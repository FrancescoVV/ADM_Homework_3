The Rotters' Club	Rotters' Club #1	Jonathan Coe	3.96	11088	648	Birmingham, England, c. 1973: industrial strikes, bad pop music, corrosive class warfare, adolescent angst, IRA bombings. Four friends: a class clown who stoops very low for a laugh; a confused artist enthralled by guitar rock; an earnest radical with socialist leanings; and a quiet dreamer obsessed with poetry, God, and the prettiest girl in school. As the world appears to self-destruct around them, they hold together to navigate the choppy waters of a decidedly ambiguous decade.	415	February 22nd 2001		Midlands, England, Birmingham, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41038.The_Rotters_Club
