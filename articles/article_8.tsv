The Chronicles of Narnia	The Chronicles of Narnia (Publication Order) #1–7	C.S. Lewis, Pauline Baynes	4.26	521114	10407	Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evil—what more could any reader ask for in one book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia. For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations. This edition presents all seven books—unabridged—in one impressive volume. The books are presented here in chronlogical order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes. Deceptively simple and direct, The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published.	767	1956	Polly, Aslan, Lucy Pevensie, Edmund Pevensie, Eustace Scrubb, Prince Caspian, Jill Pole, Prince Rilian, Puddleglum, Trumpkin, Jewel, Aravis, Mr. Tumnus, Puzzle, King Tirian, Digory Kirke, Peter Pevensie, Susan Pevensie, Reepicheep, Jadis, Bacchus (god), Mr. & Mrs. Beaver, Andrew Kirke, Shasta, Silenus, Nikabrik, King Miraz, Dr. Cornelius, Trufflehunter, Shift	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11127.The_Chronicles_of_Narnia
