Raised by Wolves	Raised by Wolves #1	Jennifer Lynn Barnes	3.93	28310	1633	Adopted by the Alpha of a werewolf pack after a rogue wolf brutally killed her parents right before her eyes, fifteen-year-old Bryn knows only pack life, and the rigid social hierarchy that controls it. That doesn't mean that she's averse to breaking a rule or two. But when her curiosity gets the better of her and she discovers Chase, a new teen locked in a cage in her guardian's basement, and witnesses him turn into a wolf before her eyes, the horrific memories of her parents' murders return. Bryn becomes obsessed with getting her questions answered, and Chase is the only one who can provide the information she needs. But in her drive to find the truth, will Bryn push too far beyond the constraints of the pack, forcing her to leave behind her friends, her family, and the identity that she's shaped?	432	June 8th 2010	Bronwyn "Bryn" Alessia St. Vincent Clare, Chase (Raised by Wolves), Callum (Raised by Wolves)	Montana (United States), Wyoming (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6905534-raised-by-wolves
