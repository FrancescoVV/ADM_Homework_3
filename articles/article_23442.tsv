Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age		Modris Eksteins	4.13	2313	152	A rare and remarkable cultural history of World War I that unearths the roots of modernism Dazzling in its originality, Rites of Spring probes the origins, impact, and aftermath of World War I, from the premiere of Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913, to the death of Hitler in 1945. Recognizing that The Great War was the psychological turning point . . . for modernism as a whole, author Modris Eksteins examines the lives of ordinary people, works of modern literature, and pivotal historical events to redefine the way we look at our past and toward our future.	396	April 1st 1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162331.Rites_of_Spring
