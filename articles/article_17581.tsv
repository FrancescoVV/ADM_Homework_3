Blood Rose	The Blood Saga #1	Jacquelynn Gagne	4.13	93	18	Nightmares, acting as messages from a lost time, have plagued Lianna Loraine Von all her life. Magical and horrific dreams have drawn her in so close to the otherworld that each night as they worsen they bring her closer to the dead and the damned. She wakes cut, burned, and bleeding as they steal her sanity in a time when clarity means the difference in survival and demise. Lianna must stand strong, and fight for not only her life, but her destiny.	340	March 31st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16150740-blood-rose
