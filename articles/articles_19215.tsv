Samson: The Modern Day America		Stephen R. Williams	5.00	2	1	This book begins with the story of Samson, the only person in the Bible to hold incredible physical strength. He was born to live a life of service to the Lord, ordained by God to be a Nazirite, and destined to judge and rule the Philistines. Samson's life is then compared to the powerful country of America, which was once a nation of people seeking a place of worship and service to God. Through time, both Samson and America acquired power that any entity would want. However, a common weakness leads them both to destruction. Discover the cause of a great man's fall and its shocking similarity to the struggle of a powerful country. Backed with Biblical scriptures, Samson: The Modern-Day America is a book that holds nothing short of the key to a struggling country's redemption.	110	July 27th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43719900-samson
