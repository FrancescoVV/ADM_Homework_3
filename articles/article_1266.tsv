Flipped		Wendelin Van Draanen	3.95	97445	7519	Flipped is a romance told in two voices. The first time Juli Baker saw Bryce Loski, she flipped. The first time Bryce saw Juli, he ran. That's pretty much the pattern for these two neighbors until the eighth grade, when, just as Juli is realizing Bryce isn't as wonderful as she thought, Bryce is starting to see that Juli is pretty amazing. How these two teens manage to see beyond the surface of things and come together makes for a comic and poignant romance.	212	October 9th 2001	Bryce Loski, Julianna Baker		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331920.Flipped
