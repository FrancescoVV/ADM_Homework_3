The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane		Kate DiCamillo, Bagram Ibatoulline	4.36	81827	9908	A timeless tale by the incomparable Kate DiCamillo, complete with stunning full-color plates by Bagram Ibatoulline, honors the enduring power of love. "Someone will come for you, but first you must open your heart. . . ." Once, in a house on Egypt Street, there lived a china rabbit named Edward Tulane. The rabbit was very pleased with himself, and for good reason: he was owned by a girl named Abilene, who treated him with the utmost care and adored him completely. And then, one day, he was lost. Kate DiCamillo takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the depths of the ocean to the net of a fisherman, from the top of a garbage heap to the fireside of a hoboes' camp, from the bedside of an ailing child to the bustling streets of Memphis. And along the way, we are shown a true miracle â€” that even a heart of the most breakable kind can learn to love, to lose, and to love again.	200	February 14th 2006	Edward Tulane, Abilene		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37186.The_Miraculous_Journey_of_Edward_Tulane
