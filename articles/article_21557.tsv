The Pull of the Stars		Emma Donoghue	4.02	17677	2904	In an Ireland doubly ravaged by war and disease, Nurse Julia Power works at an understaffed hospital in the city center, where expectant mothers who have come down with the terrible new Flu are quarantined together. Into Julia's regimented world step two outsiders -- Doctor Kathleen Lynn, a rumoured Rebel on the run from the police , and a young volunteer helper, Bridie Sweeney. In the darkness and intensity of this tiny ward, over three days, these women change each other's lives in unexpected ways. They lose patients to this baffling pandemic, but they also shepherd new life into a fearful world. With tireless tenderness and humanity, carers and mothers alike somehow do their impossible work. In The Pull of the Stars , Emma Donoghue once again finds the light in the darkness in this new classic of hope and survival against all odds.	295	July 21st 2020	Julia Power, Bridie Sweeney, Kathleen Lynn, Sister Luke, Tim Power, Groyne	Dublin (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52722079-the-pull-of-the-stars
