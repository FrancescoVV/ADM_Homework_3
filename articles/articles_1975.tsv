Nutshell		Ian McEwan	3.67	43969	5465	Nutshell is a classic story of murder and deceit, told by a narrator with a perspective and voice unlike any in recent literature. A bravura performance, it is the finest recent work from a true master. To be bound in a nutshell, see the world in two inches of ivory, in a grain of sand. Why not, when all of literature, all of art, of human endeavour, is just a speck in the universe of possible things.	208	September 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30008702-nutshell
