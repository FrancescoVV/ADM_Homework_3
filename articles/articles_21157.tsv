Knightly Love		Fyn Alexander	3.29	179	33	In the days when men sought to rescue damsels in distress, Sir Benedict Childerley’s only desire is to rescue Lord Robin Holt from an arranged marriage. Lord Robin, a sweet, gentle boy from a wealthy family, wants a knight in shining armor. When they meet Sir Ben is not charging in a white steed, but on his back unconscious after a jousting accident. Temporarily banished to a Welsh monastery, Lord Robin tends the knight’s injuries, and despite this ignominious first encounter, Lord Robin quickly realizes that the handsome knight is the only man who can win his heart. Sir Ben, the bastard son of a rich lord, is willing to fight an army in order to keep his beloved boy.	133	November 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12988400-knightly-love
