Dragon Flight	Dragon Slippers #2	Jessica Day George	4.19	18624	895	With the Dragon Wars over, Creel finds herself bored with life as a seamstress. Then word comes that a bordering country has been breeding dragons in preparation for an invasion. Never one to sit around, Creel throws herself headlong into an adventure that will reunite her with her dragon friend Shardas, pit her against a vicious new enemy and perhaps rekindle a friendship with Prince Luka that seems to have gone cold. Funny, heart-felt, and action packed, this is a sequel that will satisfy on every level.	262	April 29th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2208744.Dragon_Flight
