Women, Food and God: An Unexpected Path to Almost Everything		Geneen Roth	3.65	14297	1639	Roth began exploring emotional eating in her bestseller When Food Is Love . Now, two decades later, here is her masterwork: WOMEN FOOD AND GOD . The way you eat is inseparable from your core beliefs about being alive. No matter how sophisticated or wise or enlightened you believe you are, how you eat tells all. The world is on your plate. When you begin to understand what prompts you to use food as a way to numb or distract yourself, the process takes you deeper into realms of spirit and to the bright center of your own life. Rather than getting rid of or instantly changing your conflicted relationship with food, Women Food and God is about welcoming what is already here, and contacting the part of yourself that is already wholeâ€”divinity itself.	224	May 11th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6758423-women-food-and-god
