The Many Sins of Lord Cameron	Mackenzies & McBrides #3	Jennifer Ashley	4.09	13379	931	He is a man of simple tastes—and complex pleasures... Cameron Mackenzie is a man who loves only horses and women—in that order—or so his mistresses say. Ainsley Douglas is a woman with a strong sense of justice and the desire to help others—even if that means sneaking around a rakish man's bedchamber. Which is exactly where Cam finds her—six years after he caught her the first time. Only then, she convinced Cam she was seeking a liaison, but couldn't go through with it because of her husband. Now a widow, she's on a mission to retrieve letters that could prove embarrassing to the queen. Cam has no interest in Ainsley's subterfuge, but he vows to finish what they started those many years ago. One game, one kiss at a time, he plans to seduce her. And what starts out as a lusty diversion may break Cam's own rules—and heal the scars of a dark and damaging past...	320	2011	Lord Ian Mackenzie, Beth (Ackerley) Mackenzie, Isabella (Scranton) Mackenzie, Ainsley (Douglas) Mackenzie, Daniel Mackenzie, Hart Mackenzie, Duke of Kilmorgan, Lord Cameron Mackenzie, Lord Roland "Mac" Mackenzie	London, England (United Kingdom), Paris (France), Monte Carlo (Monaco), Scottish Highlands , 1882, Scottish Highlands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8563824-the-many-sins-of-lord-cameron
