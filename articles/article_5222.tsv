Taken by Storm	Raised by Wolves #3	Jennifer Lynn Barnes	4.12	7200	686	In the eye of a storm stands Bryn, the alpha of the Cedar Ridge werewolf pack. She is young. Female. Human. Physically weaker than any werewolf, she could never survive a battle with another alpha, the strongest, fiercest, and canniest of his pack. Yet she cannot refuse a summons from the werewolf Senate. A rogue werewolf is attacking humans. The risk of exposure threatens to destroy pack life, and the center of the crisis is Cedar Ridge territory—her own lands. Bryn has no choice but to attend the meeting, a gathering of the most powerful werewolves on the continent. The subject is the rogue wolf, but Bryn knows the other packs want what she has. Her territory. Her females. Her pack. They want her death. Werewolf law prevents the other alphas from making a direct attack. It also prevents her former alpha, the mysterious and powerful Callum, from coming to her aid. But it doesn’t prevent Bryn from knowing what she wants. To keep her lands. To protect her pack. To survive.	314	May 1st 2012	Bronwyn "Bryn" Alessia St. Vincent Clare, Chase (Raised by Wolves), Callum (Raised by Wolves)	Wyoming (United States), North Dakota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12680993-taken-by-storm
