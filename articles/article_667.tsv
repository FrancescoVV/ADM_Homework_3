Crooked Kingdom	The Six of Crows Trilogy #2	Leigh Bardugo	4.58	199693	26571	Welcome to the world of the Grisha. Kaz Brekker and his crew of deadly outcasts have just pulled off a heist so daring even they didn't think they'd survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives. Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from around the world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals and new enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties. A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will decide the fate of the Grisha world.	536	September 27th 2016	Genya Safin, Inej Ghafa, Kaz Brekker, Jesper Fahey, Wylan Van Eck, Matthias Helvar, Nina Zenik, Zoya Nazyalensky, Nikolai Lantsov	Ketterdam	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22299763-crooked-kingdom
