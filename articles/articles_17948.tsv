The Rose Knight		Anaiya Sophia	3.88	8	1	In the Beginning... Out of the heavens came She, the Holy Sophia, the Mother of all Creation. Forsaking Her divinity, She falls to Earth and some things that should not be forgotten became lost. Awaiting Her is a growing abomination: a powerful Dark Lord attempting to control the world and enslave the divine spark of humanity forever. Now... Lonely, broken and blind to her own divinity, modern-day Sophia is found living in the suburbs of Los Angeles. With a one-way ticket to the south of France, she walks into a series of events that ferociously forces her to remember who she really is. With her self esteem shattered from an abusive relationship, it isn't easy for Sophia to believe that she is actually the Queen of Heaven. In fact, it all seems like a horrible joke. As the seconds tick, Sophia discovers the true identity of the Dark Lord, the desperate situation humanity is facing, and how she is the One She sent to save them.	270	March 7th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21807777-the-rose-knight
