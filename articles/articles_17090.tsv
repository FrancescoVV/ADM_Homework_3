Farewell, My Lovelies		Diann Blakely	4.47	15	4	Farewell, My Lovelies Diann Blakely Just as Diann Blakely's title pays homage to the classic "crime noir" writing of Raymond Chandler, the poems themselves evoke the bright, brassy lights, thick weather, and dark alleys that honeycomb human relationships-particularly love, and lust relationships. This is the poet's long-awaited second collection.	73	January 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357528.Farewell_My_Lovelies
