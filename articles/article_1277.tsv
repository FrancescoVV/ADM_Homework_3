Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs #1	Judi Barrett, Ron Barrett	4.16	130882	2248	The beloved, bestselling tale of edible weather is brought to life! If food dropped like rain from the sky, wouldn't it be marvelous! Or would it? It could, after all, be messy. And you'd have no choice. What if you didn't like what fell? Or what if too much came? Have you ever thought of what it might be like to be squashed flat by a pancake?	32	August 1st 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8073.Cloudy_With_a_Chance_of_Meatballs
