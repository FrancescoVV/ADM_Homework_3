The Girl in 6E	Deanna Madden #1	A.R. Torre	3.81	20252	3178	I haven't touched a human in three years. That seems like it would be a difficult task, but it's not. Not anymore, thanks to the internet. I am, quite possibly, the most popular recluse ever. Not many shut-ins have a 200-member fan club, a bank account in the seven-figure range, and hundreds of men lining up to pay for undivided attention. They get satisfaction, I get a distraction. Their secret desires are nothing compared to why I hide... my lust for blood, my love of death. Taking their money is easy. Keeping all these secrets... one is bound to escape. What if you hid yourself away because all you could think of was killing? And what if one girl's life was depending on you venturing into society? Enter a world of lies, thrills, fears, and all desires, in this original thriller from A. R. Torre.	352	April 15th 2013	Deanna Madden	Georgia (United States), Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20640318-the-girl-in-6e
