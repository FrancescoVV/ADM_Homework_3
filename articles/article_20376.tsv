Jacob's Room		Virginia Woolf	3.54	8331	684	Virginia Woolf's first original and distinguished work, Jacob's Room is the story of a sensitive young man named Jacob Flanders. The life story, character and friends of Jacob are presented in a series for separate scenes and moments from his childhood, through college at Cambridge, love affairs in London, and travels in Greece, to his death in the war. Jacob's Room established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a highly poetic and symbolic writer who places emphasis not on plot or action but on the psychological realm of occupied by her characters.	324	1922	Jacob Flanders, Clara Durrant		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225396.Jacob_s_Room
