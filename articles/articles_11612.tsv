The Living Blood	African Immortals #2	Tananarive Due	4.34	2149	151	Jessica Jacobs-Wolde's life was destroyed when her husband, David Wolde killed both their daughter Kira and Jessica herself--and revived Jessica with his healing blood. David was a Life Brother, member of an ancient, secret, and immortal African clan. Now Jessica, hiding with her surviving daughter in rural Botswana, attempts to make sense of her new existence, and of Fana's growing abilities. Jessica's only hope of teaching Fana to control her dangerous talents is to travel to Ethiopia and find the Life Brothers' hidden colony. --Cynthia Ward	515	2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41538.The_Living_Blood
