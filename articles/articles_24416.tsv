INFALLIBLE (BOOK 3) THE COMMITMENT FALLOUT		T.J. Spencer Jacques	4.64	11	1	Volume 3 of Infallible is a tale of Confrontations & Consequences as our cast of men struggle to achieve a semblance of stability. Not only have the tables turned, but the atmosphere in Uncle Glen's apartment has shifted from joyous, to worrisome. None of the relationships survived Uncle Glenn's Challenge, but closing out on the prize money is the least of their concerns. WELCOME TO KARMA! From Volume 1 to this current addition of Infallible, you will become submerged in these characters. As you follow their lives page by page you will hope for the best, but expect the worst. It is true that what goes around comes around, and in the case of Jarvis, Timothy, Rasta, Telly, and Biyell - what's coming back around will make them regret every lie told. IT WAS THE RIGHT YOU, BUT THE WRONG HIM! To love a broken man is like pouring tar into a pothole. When you have filled one, another appears. In many cases, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with you, your weight, your hair, or your personality, the problem is you were a temporary fill. Welcome to Infallible, written from the point of view of six men who never intended their conversations to go public. Intense Urban Fiction Series.	279	August 18th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45160724-infallible-book-3-the-commitment-fallout
