The Saggy Baggy Elephant		Kathryn Jackson, Byron Jackson, Gustav Tenggren	4.08	17303	160	After a parrot makes fun of Sooki's big ears, long nose, and wrinkled skin, the "saggy baggy" elephant isn't too sure of himself. But once he meets some beautiful creatures who look just like him, Sooki celebrates with a joyful "one-two-three-kick." For over 50 years, parents and children have treasured this tale, with gorgeous art by Gustaf Tenggren, the illustrator of The Poky Little Puppy .	24	1947			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/825576.The_Saggy_Baggy_Elephant
