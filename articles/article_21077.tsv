Denton Little's Deathdate	Denton Little #1	Lance   Rubin	3.84	5738	1126	Denton Little's Deathdate takes place in a world exactly like our own except that everyone knows the day they will die. For 17-year-old Denton Little, that's tomorrow, the day of his senior prom. Despite his early deathdate, Denton has always wanted to live a normal life, but his final days are filled with dramatic firsts. First hangover. First sex. First love triangle (as the first sex seems to have happened not with his adoring girlfriend, but with his best friend's hostile sister. Though he's not totally sure. See: first hangover.) His anxiety builds when he discovers a strange purple rash making its way up his body. Is this what will kill him? And then a strange man shows up at his funeral, claiming to have known Denton's long-deceased mother, and warning him to beware of suspicious government charactersâ€¦. Suddenly Denton's life is filled with mysterious questions and precious little time to find the answers.	352	March 26th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24721702-denton-little-s-deathdate
