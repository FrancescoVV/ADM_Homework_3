The Book of Mirdad: The strange story of a monastery which was once called The Ark		Mikhail Naimy	4.36	1627	210	Mikhail Naimy's timeless classic, an allegory often compared to the works of his friend Khalil Gibran, presents the teachings of Mirdad, Abbott of a monastery that stands where Noah's Ark came to rest after the Flood. In a series of dialogues with his disciples, Mirdad offers lessons on themes such as love, obedience, borrowing and lending, repentance, old age, and the cycle of life and death. Reissued for a new generation, this prophetic work calls on humankind to prepare for another deluge, greater than Noah's, when Heaven will be revealed on Earth. Includes a new foreword by Andrew Harvey, author of the bestselling A Journey in Ladakh and several other seminal works of spirituality!	192	1946			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1487022.The_Book_of_Mirdad
