God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything		Christopher Hitchens	3.96	89929	4712	>With his unique brand of erudition and wit, Hitchens describes the ways in which religion is man-made. "God did not make us," he says. "We made God." He explains the ways in which religion is immoral: We damage our children by indoctrinating them. It is a cause of sexual repression, violence, and ignorance. It is a distortion of our origins and the cosmos. In the place of religion, Hitchens offers the promise of a new enlightenment through science and reason, a realm in which hope and wonder can be found through a strand of DNA or a gaze through the Hubble Telescope. As Hitchens sees it, you needn't get the blues once you discover the heavens are empty.	307	2007	Moses (Bible), Joseph Stalin, Osama Bin Laden, Voltaire, Joseph Smith, Mother Teresa, Steven Seagal, Jerry Falwell, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Mary, mother of Jesus (Bible), Baruch Spinoza, E.P.
