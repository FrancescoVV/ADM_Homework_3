When a young heir receives a sinister death threat, Inspectors Frey and 'Nine-Nails' McGray answer a desperate plea to offer him protection. The detectives travel north to the remote and misty Loch Maree, site of an ancient burial ground. They must stay with the mysterious Koloman family - any one of whom might be a suspect. But Frey and McGray have little time to get their bearings. Even before they arrive the boy's guardian is brutally murdered, and one thing becomes clear to the two detectives: Someone is willing to kill to protect the secrets of Loch Maree. _______________ Praise for the Frey & McGray series: 'This is wonderful.

Love and murder - they go together like strawberries and cream' Independent 'A brilliant mix of horror, history, and humour.

Everything you need in a mystery thriller' Crime Review 'Fast-paced, well-researched and thoroughly spellbinding.
