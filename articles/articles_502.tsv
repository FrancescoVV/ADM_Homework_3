Brideshead Revisited		Evelyn Waugh	4.00	93479	4683	The most nostalgic and reflective of Evelyn Waugh's novels, Brideshead Revisited looks back to the golden age before the Second World War. It tells the story of Charles Ryder's infatuation with the Marchmains and the rapidly-disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian at Oxford, then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognize only his spiritual and social distance from them.	351	1945	Charles Ryder, Lord Sebastian Flyte, Lady Julia Flyte, Rex Mottram, Anthony Blanche	England, Oxford, England, Venice (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30933.Brideshead_Revisited
