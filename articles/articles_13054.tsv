I Am a Cat	I am a Cat #1-3	Natsume S≈çseki, Aiko Ito, Graeme Wilson	3.71	8426	889	Written from 1904 through 1906, Soseki Natsume's comic masterpiece, I Am a Cat, satirizes the foolishness of upper-middle-class Japanese society during the Meiji era. With acerbic wit and sardonic perspective, it follows the whimsical adventures of a world-weary stray kitten who comments on the follies and foibles of the people around him. A classic of Japanese literature, I Am a Cat is one of Soseki's best-known novels. Considered by many as the most significant writer in modern Japanese history, Soseki's I Am a Cat is a classic novel sure to be enjoyed for years to come.	480	1905	Chinno Kushami, Meitei, Mizushima Kangetsu, Kaneda Tomiko		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62772.I_Am_a_Cat
