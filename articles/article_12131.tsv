The Damnation Game		Clive Barker	3.83	17766	521	There are things worse than death. There are games so seductively evil, so wondrously vile, no gambler can resist. Amid the shadow-scarred rubble of World War II, Joseph Whitehead dared to challenge the dark champion of lifeâ€™s ultimate game. Now a millionaire, locked in a terror-shrouded fortress of his own design, Joseph Whitehead has hell to pay. And no soul is safe from this ravaging fear, the resurrected fury, the unspeakable desire of The Damnation Game.	433	August 19th 1985	Marty Strauss, Joseph Whitehead, Carys Whitehead, Mamoulian, Mr. Toy, Anthony Breer		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34605.The_Damnation_Game
