The Truth About Forever		Sarah Dessen	4.12	209541	8274	That's what Macy has to look forward to while her boyfriend, Jason, is away at Brain Camp. Days will be spent at a boring job in the library, evenings will be filled with vocabulary drills for the SATs, and spare time will be passed with her mother, the two of them sharing a silent grief at the traumatic loss of Macy's father. But sometimes, unexpected things can happenâ€”things such as the catering job at Wish, with its fun-loving, chaotic crew. Or her sister's project of renovating the neglected beach house, awakening long-buried memories. Things such as meeting Wes, a boy with a past, a taste for Truth-telling, and an amazing artistic talent, the kind of boy who could turn any girl's world upside down. As Macy ventures out of her shell, she begins to question her sheltered life.	374	May 11th 2004	Macy Queen, Wes Baker, Monica Palmetto, Kristy Palmetto, Bert Baker, Caroline Queen, Jason Talbot, Deborah Queen		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51737.The_Truth_About_Forever
