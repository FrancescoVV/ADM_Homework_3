I am Going!	Elephant & Piggie #11	Mo Willems	4.32	3484	223	Gerald is careful. Piggie is not. Piggie cannot help smiling. Gerald can. Gerald and Piggie are best friends. In I Am Going! , Piggie ruins a perfectly good day by telling Gerald she is going. If Piggie goes, who will Gerald skip with, play Ping-Pong with, and wear silly hats with? Willems's Geisel Award winning duo continues to delight readers with their silly shenanigans. Packed full of humor and heart, the Elephant & Piggie Books are vetted by an early-learning specialist and early learners themselves, so they'll be right on target for new readers.	64	January 26th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6642732-i-am-going
