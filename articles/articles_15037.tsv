Doll Bones		Holly Black, Eliza Wheeler	3.67	25079	3967	Zach, Poppy and Alice have been friends for ever. They love playing with their action figure toys, imagining a magical world of adventure and heroism. But disaster strikes when, without warning, Zach’s father throws out all his toys, declaring he’s too old for them. Zach is furious, confused and embarrassed, deciding that the only way to cope is to stop playing . . . and stop being friends with Poppy and Alice. But one night the girls pay Zach a visit, and tell him about a series of mysterious occurrences. Poppy swears that she is now being haunted by a china doll – who claims that it is made from the ground-up bones of a murdered girl. They must return the doll to where the girl lived, and bury it. Otherwise the three children will be cursed for eternity . . .	244	May 7th 2013	Zach, Alice, Poppy Bell, Tom Bell, Nate Bell	Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15944406-doll-bones
