Illuminated	White Road Chronicles #1	Jackie Castle	4.07	224	41	Alyra, mockingly known as Princess, was captured at an early age by the evil ruler, Darnel, and brought up in the dark land of Racah. At the age of seventeen, she considers herself nothing special. She has no recollection of who she is or where she came from. Her hope of ever finding freedom dims. Until the messenger arrives. Until he brings to light the meaning behind the medallion she's kept hidden. Until she accepts the blinding truth. Now she flees for her life. Alyraâ€™s journey leads her down a narrow road with strange traveling companions. Together, they encounter a kingdom where nothing is what it first seems.	342	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16700511-illuminated
