The Road to Wigan Pier		George Orwell, Richard Hoggart	3.91	15682	1082	A searing account of George Orwellâ€™s experiences of working-class life in the bleak industrial heartlands of Yorkshire and Lancashire, The Road to Wigan Pier is a brilliant and bitter polemic that has lost none of its political impact over time. His graphically unforgettable descriptions of social injustice, slum housing, mining conditions, squalor, hunger and growing unemployment are written with unblinking honesty, fury and great humanity.	215	March 1937	H.G.
