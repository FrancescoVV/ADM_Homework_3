The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí		Salvador Dalí, Haakon Chevalier	4.13	2330	142	This early autobiography, which takes Dalí through his late thirties, is as startling and unpredictable as his art. On its first publication, the reviewer of Books observed: "It is impossible not to admire this painter as writer ... (Dalí) succeeds in doing exactly what he sets out to do ... communicates the snobbishness, self-adoration, comedy, seriousness, fanaticism, in short the concept of life and the total picture of himself he sets out to portray." Superbly illustrated with over eighty photographs of Dalí and his works, and scores of Dalí drawings and sketches.	432	1942			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91724.The_Secret_Life_of_Salvador_Dal_
