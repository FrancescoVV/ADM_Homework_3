Redmond, Susan Vaught	3.96	785	67	In Eyrie — a world of two moons, shapeshifters, and powerful magic — Aron of Brailing knows he owes loyalty to his guild, obedience to the code of the land, and his life to his closest companions, but it is his own family he holds closest to his heart. Kidnapped and forced to become an assassin, Aron must learn to control and harness his own fearsome talents even as he grieves for the family he knows is lost forever. But when he is tempted to put everything aside everything he has learned in order to avenge his family's killers, will Aron make unforgivable mistakes? Assassin's Apprentice unveils an intriguing cast of characters whose sense of honour, strength, and history binds them together, and whose incredible talents of mind and body set them apart.	434	May 12th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7305155-assassin-s-apprentice
