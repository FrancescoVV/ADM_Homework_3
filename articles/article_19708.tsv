Joseph Heller's Catch-22: Notes	Monarch Notes	Walter James Miller, Bonnie E. Nelson	3.85	384	24	Catch-22 is like no other novel we have ever read. It has its own style, its own rationale, its own extraordinary character. It moves back and forth from hilarity to horror. It is outrageously funny and strangely affecting.	114	May 15th 1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42908.Joseph_Heller_s_Catch_22
