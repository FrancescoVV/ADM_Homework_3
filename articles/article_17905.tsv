Don't Tell	Romantic Suspense #1	Karen      Rose	4.10	11676	758	It was a desperate plan. But Mary Grace Winters knew the only way to save herself and her child from her abusive cop husband was to stage their own death. Now all that remains of their former life is at the bottom of a lake. Armed with a new identity in a new town, she and her son have found refuge hundreds of miles away. As Caroline Stewart, she has almost forgotten the nightmare she left behind nine years ago. She is even taking a chance on love with Max Hunter, a man with wounds of his own. But her past is about to collide with the present when her husband uncovers her trail and threatens her hard-won peace. Step by step, he's closing in on herâ€”and everything and everyone she loves.	501	July 1st 2003	Dana Dupinsky Buchanan, Special Agent Steven Thatcher, Eve Wilson, Caroline Stewart, Dr. Max Hunter, David Hunter, Nicky Thatcher, Aunt Helen, Tom Hunter, Phoebe Hunter	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Asheville, North Carolina (United States), Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248086.Don_t_Tell
