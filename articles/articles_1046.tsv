Chronicle of a Death Foretold		Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa	3.97	128013	6372	A man returns to the town where a baffling murder took place twenty-seven years earlier, determined to get to the bottom of the story. Just hours after marrying the beautiful Angela Vicario, everyone agrees, Bayardo San Roman returned his bride in disgrace to her parents. Her distraught family forced her to name her first lover; and her twin brothers announced their intention to murder Santiago Nasar for dishonoring their sister. Yet if everyone knew the murder was going to happen, why did no one intervene to try and stop it? The more that is learned, the less is understood, and as the story races to its inexplicable conclusion, an entire society--not just a pair of murderers—is put on trial.	120	April 1981	Santiago Nasar, Ángela Vicario, Bayardo San Román, Pedro Vicario, Pablo Vicario	Colombia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23878.Chronicle_of_a_Death_Foretold
