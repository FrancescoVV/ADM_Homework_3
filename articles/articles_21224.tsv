Impossible Things		Kate Johnson	3.90	861	92	Kael Vapensigsson is one of the elite Chosenâ€”a Warlord whose strength comes from the gods themselves. But despite all his power and prestige, he is plagued by a prophecy that threatens to destroy everything he loves. When Kael summons Ishtaer to his room and discovers the marks of the Chosen on her body, including the revered mark of the Warrior, both Warlord and slave seem to have met their match. But as their lives become increasingly entangled and endangered, Ishtaer is forced to test whether the Chosen ever have the ability to choose their own fate. Kate's UK debut, The UnTied Kingdom , was short listed for the RNA's 2012 Romantic Contemporary Novel of the Year award.	356	January 6th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18570069-impossible-things
