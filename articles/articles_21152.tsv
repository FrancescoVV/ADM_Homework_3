The Song of Ribhu: Translated from the Original Tamil Version of the Ribhu Gita		H. Ramamoorthy	4.84	31	5	Sometimes Maharishi and his disciples sit up, especially after the night meal, reading Ribhu Gita, each by turn reading a verse. It is very easy to follow; and in places Maharishi puts in a word or two to make the meaning clear. The reading continues for about two hours at a stretch. “These readings,” he says, “from Ribhu Gita are as good as Samadhi.” Evidently such a continuous reading (following the meaning intently) induces Samadhi. In fact, page after page, nay after line, of Ribhu Gita merely goes on rubbing into one the Reality of the Self. With a constant study of such works the mind easily gets into the mood of Samadhi. The words keep ringing in the ears or within the heart for a long while and after as well.	760	July 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3916451-the-song-of-ribhu
