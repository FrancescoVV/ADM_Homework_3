PopCo		Scarlett Thomas	3.73	5291	577	Are you happy? Alice Butler has been receiving some pretty odd messages—all anonymous, all written in simple code, all eerily vague but pointed enough to show that the sender has been watching her closely. Are the messages from someone at PopCo—the slightly sinister, profit-hungry toy company that has herded Alice and its other top creatives out to a secluded Thought Camp? Are they from Alice’s long-disappeared, treasure-hunting father? Are they from someone who knows that her cryptanalyst grandfather left her the key to finding that treasure? Is quiet Ben, Alice’s new love, hiding something that could help her discover their source? And could it be that these codes will lead Alice to a secret even more carefully guarded than her own?	512	December 31st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4285468-popco
