The Winter Rose	The Tea Rose #2	Jennifer Donnelly	4.31	19831	1427	Another strong, satisfying novel, full of rich storytelling, by the author of the favourite THE TEA ROSE. An epic tale of secret love and hidden passions. It is 1900 and the dangerous streets of East London are no place for a well-bred woman. But India Selwyn Jones is headstrong: she has trained as one of a new breed, a woman doctor, and is determined to practice where the need is greatest. It is in these grim streets where India meets - and saves the life of - London's most notorious gangster, Sid Malone. Hard, violent, devastatingly attractive, Malone is the opposite of India's cool, aristocratic fiance. though Malone represents all she despises, India finds herself unwillingly drawn ever closer to him - enticed by his charm, intrigued by his hidden, mysterious past. tHE WINtER ROSE brings the beginning of the turbulent twentieth century vividly to life, drawing the reader into its wretched underworld, its privileged society, and the shadowland between the two, where the strict rules of the time blur into secret passions. Praise for tHE tEA ROSE: 'Most seductive . . . the writing is so fluid you feel the author simply loves telling her story' Frank McCourt 'I loved this vividly researched and wonderfully rumbustious yarn - brilliantly told, great fun to read' Simon Winchester	736	November 30th 2006	Fiona Finnegan, Joe Bristow, Seamie Finnegan, Charlie Finnegan, Roddy O'Meara, Sid Malone, Willa Alden, India Selwyn-Jones, Frederick Lytton, Gemma Dean, Frankie Betts	London, England (United Kingdom), Africa	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/396266.The_Winter_Rose
