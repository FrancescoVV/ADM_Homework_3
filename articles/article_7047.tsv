The Wanting Seed		Anthony Burgess	3.71	5920	343	Tristram Foxe and his wife, Beatrice-Joanna, live in their skyscraper world where official family limitation glorifies homosexuality. Eventually, their world is transformed into a chaos of cannibalistic dining-clubs, fantastic fertility rituals, and wars without anger. It is a novel both extravagantly funny and grimly serious.	288	1962		United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8809.The_Wanting_Seed
