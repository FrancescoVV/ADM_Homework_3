Shelby & Shauna Kitt and the Dimensional Holes	Shelby and Shauna Kitt #1	P.H.C. Marchesi	4.18	55	16	Shelby Kitt never gets lost. Shauna, his sister, never gets sick. As far as most people are concerned, the inseparable Kitt twins are odd 13-year-olds. No one, however - not even Shelby and Shauna - can guess how extraordinary they are until the vice consul of Miriax, a planet from another dimension, asks them to take part in a dangerous mission. From that moment on, Shelby and Shauna Kitt discover that the universe is full of klodians, cities in jungles, giant bats, and tea with mushrooms. Most of all, they discover that it will take more than special powers for them to face - and survive - the evil that threatens the galaxy.	348	December 8th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10046509-shelby-shauna-kitt-and-the-dimensional-holes
