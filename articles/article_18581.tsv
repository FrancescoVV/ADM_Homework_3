Blueeyedboy		Joanne Harris	3.26	4278	520	'Once there was a widow with three sons, and their names were Black, Brown and Blue. Black was the eldest; moody and aggressive. Brown was the middle child, timid and dull. But Blue was his mother's favourite. And he was a murderer.' Blueyedboy is the brilliant new novel from Joanne Harris: a dark and intricately plotted tale of a poisonously dysfunctional family, a blind child prodigy, and a serial murderer who is not who he seems. Told through posts on badguysrock@webjournal.com , this is a thriller that makes creative use of all the disguise, deception and mind games that are offered by playing out one's life on the internet.	416	March 31st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6962314-blueeyedboy
