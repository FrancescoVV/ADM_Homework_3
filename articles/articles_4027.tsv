The Buried Giant		Kazuo Ishiguro	3.52	73832	9609	"You've long set your heart against it, Axl, I know. But it's time now to think on it anew. There's a journey we must go on, and no more delay..." The Buried Giant begins as a couple set off across a troubled land of mist and rain in the hope of finding a son they have not seen in years. Sometimes savage, often intensely moving, Kazuo Ishiguro's first novel in nearly a decade is about lost memories, love, revenge, and war.	317	March 2015	Sir Gawain, Beatrice (diverse works), Axl, Wistan, Edwin, Querig, Ivor, Father Jonus, Lord Brennus		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22522805-the-buried-giant
