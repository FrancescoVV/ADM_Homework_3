Blood Will Tell	Point Last Seen #2	April Henry	4.01	2290	319	What happens when someone who’s only ever wanted to be a hero becomes a suspect? When a woman’s body is found in a Portland park, suspicion falls on an awkward teen who lives only a few blocks away, owns several knives, loves first-person shooter video games, and doodles violent scenes in his school notebooks. Nick Walker goes from being a member of a Search and Rescue team to the prime suspect in a murder, his very interest in SAR seen as proof of his fascination with violence. How is this even possible? And can Alexis and Ruby find a way to help clear Nick’s name before it’s too late?	272	June 16th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22718684-blood-will-tell
