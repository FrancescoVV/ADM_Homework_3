The only thing missing from Arvata is their town healer, who left unexpectedly six months ago and didn't tell anyone why. Lorelle finally returns to explain what the Fates had assigned her to do, but she now needs the new Elders help with the mission. Half-Guardians, that shouldn't even exist in their world, are out there and need to be protected, but time is running out. Unknown magic lurks within these hybrids and they possess powers unlike full Guardians. It's up to Kali and her friends to figure out how to protect the half-Guardians and prevent more from being created. Trust will need to be earned, unseen powers will emerge and loved one's lives are threatened. Will the risk be worth it in the end?	300	July 27th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35396707-from-the-falls
