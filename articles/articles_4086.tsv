Murder at the Vicarage	Miss Marple #1	Agatha Christie	4.06	145505	4301	‘Anyone who murdered Colonel Protheroe,’ declared the parson, brandishing a carving knife above a joint of roast beef, ‘would be doing the world at large a favour!’ It was a careless remark for a man of the cloth. And one which was to come back and haunt the clergyman just a few hours later – when the colonel was found shot dead in the clergyman’s study. But as Miss Marple soon discovers, the whole village seems to have had a motive to kill Colonel Protheroe.	288	October 1930	Inspector Slack, Lawrence Redding, Leonard Clement, Griselda Clement, Colonel Protheroe, Anne Protheroe, Lettice Protheroe, Dr. Haydock, Mrs. LeStrange, Dr. Stone, Gladys Cram, Dennis Clement, Hawes, Raymond West, Sir Henry Clithering, Mary Hill, Colonel Melchett, Miss Marple	St. Mary Mead, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16331.Murder_at_the_Vicarage
