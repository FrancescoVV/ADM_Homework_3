The Last Werewolf	The Last Werewolf / Bloodlines Trilogy #1	Glen Duncan	3.46	14913	2526	One last full moon — then it will all be over. Jacob Marlowe has lost the will to live. For two hundred years he has wandered the world, enslaved by his lunatic appetites and tormented by the memory of his first and most monstrous crime. Now, the last of his kind, he knows he cannot go on. But as Jake counts down to suicide, a violent murder and an extraordinary meeting plunge him straight back into the desperate pursuit of life — and love. Sexy, smart, bloody and heartbreaking, The Last Werewolf takes literature by the throat.	353	January 1st 2011	Jacob Marlowe		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651862-the-last-werewolf
