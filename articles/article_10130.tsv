A Girl's Guide to Vampires	Dark Ones #1	Katie MacAlister	3.71	12207	664	All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a "Goddess evoking" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger. At first the ever-practical Joy is ready to dismiss her vision as a product of too much gin and too many vampire romances, but while traveling through the Czech Republic with Roxy, Joy begins to have some second thoughts about her mystery lover because she is suddenly plagued by visions of a lethally handsome stranger. Then, when she and Roxy attend a local GothFaire, Joy meets Raphael Griffin St. John, head of security, and she becomes even more bewildered because the dark and dangerous Raphael seems too close to her dreams for comfort.	374	October 28th 2003	Joy Randall, Raphael St.John	Slovakia, Blansko (Czech Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50788.A_Girl_s_Guide_to_Vampires
