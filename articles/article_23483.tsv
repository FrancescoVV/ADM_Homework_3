Three Act Tragedy	Hercule Poirot #11	Agatha Christie	3.85	23497	1404	At an apparently respectable dinner party, a vicar is the first to die...Thirteen guests arrived at dinner at the actor's house. It was to be a particularly unlucky evening for the mild-mannered Reverend Stephen Babbington, who choked on his cocktail, went into convulsions and died. But when his martini glass was sent for chemical analysis, there was no trace of poison -- just as Poirot had predicted. Even more troubling for the great detective, there was absolutely no motive!	336	1934	Mr. Satterthwaite (Dead Man's Mirror), Hercule Poirot, Sir Charles Cartwright, Dr Bartholomew Strange, Hermione Lytton Gore, Lady Mary Lytton Gore, Captain Dacres, Cynthia Dacres, Angela Sutcliffe, Reverend Stephen Babbington, Mrs Babbington, Muriel Wills, Margaret De Rushbridger, Violet Millray, John Ellis, Oliver Manders, Coronel Johnson	Cornwall, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140360.Three_Act_Tragedy
