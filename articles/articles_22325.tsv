Extracts from Adam's Diary/Eve's Diary		Mark Twain	3.88	260	34	Written at the end of Twain's career, Extracts from Adam's Diary was first published in 1897 and Extracts from Eve's Diary in 1905. Twain's Adam was based on himself while Eve was modelled after his wife Livy. It is fitting that these two essays be joined together in one package.	104	January 1st 1906			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136405.Extracts_from_Adam_s_Diary_Eve_s_Diary
