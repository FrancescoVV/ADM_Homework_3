Surface Children		Dean Blake	4.38	13	2	“SHORT STORIES FROM A GENERATION CONSUMED BY VANITY, SELF-INDULGENCE, AND A TWISTED UNDERSTANDING OF LOVE AND HEARTBREAK” Dean has once again demonstrated his mastery of the art of storytelling in this much-anticipated collection of short stories. From a satirical tale of a group of teenagers who crave nothing but perfection to a horrific account of a young man who claims to eat people, Surface Children introduces its readers to a generation consumed by vanity, self-indulgence, violence, and a twisted understanding of love and heartbreak. Surface Children is said to be Dean Blake’s most significant work to date.
