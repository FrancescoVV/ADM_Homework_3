I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj		Nisargadatta Maharaj, Sudhaker S. Dikshit, Maurice Frydman	4.35	5424	223	This collection of the timeless teachings of one of the greatest sages of India, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, is a testament to the uniqueness of the seer's life and work and is regarded by many as a "modern spiritual classic". I Am That preserves Maharaj's dialogues with the followers who came from around the world seeking his guidance in destroying false identities. The sage's sole concern was with human suffering and the ending of suffering. It was his mission to guide the individual to an understanding of his true nature and the timelessness of being. He taught that mind must recognize and penetrate its own state of being, "being this or that, here or that, then or now," but just timeless being.	550	1973			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299869.I_Am_That
