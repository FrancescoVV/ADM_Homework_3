Not Without My Daughter		Betty Mahmoody	4.11	26047	1419	In August 1984, Michigan housewife Betty Mahmoody accompanied her husband to his native Iran for a two-week vacation that turned into a permanent stay. To her horror, she found herself and her four-year-old daughter, Mahtob, virtual prisoners of a man rededicated to his Shiite Moslem faith, in a land where women are near-slaves and Americans despised. Their only hope for escape lay in a dangerous underground that would not take her child.	528	1987		Iran, Islamic Republic of	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43255.Not_Without_My_Daughter
