The Mysterious Mr. Quin	Harley Quin #1	Agatha Christie	3.72	11149	759	Harley Quin is an enigma. Even his friend Mr Satterthwaite is unable to understand how the man seems to appear and disappear almost like a trick of the light - and when he does appear it's usually in the sparkle of sunshine, or surrounded by a spectrum of coloured light pouring through a stained glass window... In fact, the only consistent thing about the Mysterious Mr Quin is that his presence is always a harbinger of love ... or death.	396	April 14th 1930	Harley Quin, Mr. Satterthwaite (Dead Man's Mirror)	Monte Carlo (Monaco), Corsica (France), French Riviera (France), London, England (United Kingdom) Cornwall, England, London, England (United Kingdom), Cornwall, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16356.The_Mysterious_Mr_Quin
