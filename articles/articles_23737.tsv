Chasing Merlin		Sarah  White	3.70	44	15	When Dyllan Carter ships off to London to start a Master's in Medieval Literature, she expects to spend a lot of time in the library, to write a lot of papers, and to develop acute tendinitis before she finishs her thesis on the difference between Merlin the myth and Merlin the man. What she didn't expect was Emrys. After their initial crash-meeting in the tunnels of the underground, she seems to bump into him everywhere: in the library and even on the street. He knows almost as much as she does about her subject area - and he's not even in school! His actions are sometimes awkward, and very out-of-the-blue - often to the level of absurdity. So when he offers to give her a tour of the old places in Wales - not far from his home - she can't help but wonder who fate has brought her. As the legends get closer and the journey becomes more dangerous, Dyllan finds more questions and fewer answers. Will she be able to finish her thesis? Or is this her lifeâ€™s final chapter?	332	June 29th 2012		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17186369-chasing-merlin
