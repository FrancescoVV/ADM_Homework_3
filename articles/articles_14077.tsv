Love Finds a Home	Love Comes Softly #8	Janette Oke	4.27	7568	164	Book 8 of the bestselling Love Comes Softly series. Leaving her little prairie town, Belinda Davis never dreamed that the excitement of living in Boston would leave her restless and empty inside. Wealth, literature, travel, and romance touched her life with choices and decisions that brought dissatisfaction rather than joy. She discovered that only when God had first place in her life was her peace restored. Belinda once again faces decisions about her life that are no less difficult than before. A very unexpected responsibility makes the choice even harder.	237	January 1st 1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65482.Love_Finds_a_Home
