Knee Deep in the Game		Boston George	4.23	39	3	Pop is a young kid from the projects looking for a way to make a quick dollar, and an even quicker way to escape from his crazy mother's house. His whole life takes a turn when he bumps into Fresh, the neighborhood dope man who's on the lookout for a tough soldier he can trust and depend on. When their paths cross, the two immediately bond, but when trust issues, two sisters, and a freshly released convict come into the picture, things hit the fan faster than a New York minute. Pop's courage, loyalty, and heart get put to the test when he has to decide how far he's willing to go in order to come up.	288	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9592500-knee-deep-in-the-game
