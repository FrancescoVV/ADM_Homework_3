Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE, Vol. 8	Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE #8	CLAMP, William Flanagan	4.27	3144	47	INTO THE MOUTH OF THE BEAST Princess Sakura's memories are scattered across multiple dimensions - and now she and Syaoran are part of an unlikely group of friends traveling from world to world to find them. Unfortunately the memories have been transformed into immensely powerful magical feathers, and those who possess them are seldom willing to give them up without a fight. The quest takes Syaoran's odd bunch to a jungle world where helpless creatures are being terrorized by a sacrifice-demanding beast. When Syaoran, Mokona, and Sakura are separated from Fai and Kurogane, each group finds themselves on opposing sides of a conflict that threatens to destroy the future of a troupe of young women performers...and possibly the entire world!	194	November 1st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13575.Tsubasa
