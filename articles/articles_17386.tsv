Two Walls and a Roof: Ireland Born America Bound		John Michael Cahill	3.65	20	1	This is the story of an Irish family from Cork Ireland. It documents how they survived in the 50's and 60's and will take you on a roller coaster ride of every emotion, sometimes all on the same page. Here you will read of an inspiring mother, always encouraging her six children to laugh at life, and believe in tomorrow. She did this inspiring while battling a domineering old grandmother, and an alcoholic husband, as her children drank tea from their jam jars, and read by a candle. Its a book filled with humor, drama, and dreams that come true, culminating in the author meeting his American dream. It's said the book is like, Irish Stew for the Soul. You will feel uplifted when you finish reading a book that seems to be everyone's story.	374	August 27th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20734236-two-walls-and-a-roof
