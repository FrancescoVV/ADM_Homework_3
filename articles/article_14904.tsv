When Natalie's twelve-year-old son vandalizes Zeke's property and she is unable to pay for the damages, Zeke offers to let the boy work off the debt. As Zeke struggles to instill a sense of responsibility and self-worth in the troubled youngster, he finds his life being turned upside down by Natalie, whose sultry singing voice and striking eyes disguise her underlying lack of belief in herself or in her dream of becoming a professional singer. With rugged determination, Zeke undertakes to bolster her confidence, revive her ability to trust men ... and thoroughly seduce her. But just as their attraction begins to blossom, a twist of fate gravely threatens their life together ...	419	2004	Natalie Patterson, Zeke Coulter	Crystal Falls, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89352.Bright_Eyes
