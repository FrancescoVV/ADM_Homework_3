Awry	The Archers of Avalon #2	Chelsea Fine	4.17	11429	604	Three curses. Two brothers. One love triangle. Sometimes love is meant to be. But sometimes...love is the death of you. Seventeen-year-old Scarlet has just died. Only, dying isn't unusual for a girl under a centuries old curse that left her semi-immortal. This time, though, she comes back to her current life instead of awaking in a new one, and she realizes her curse is changing. With the help of the immortal Archer brothers, Scarlet tries to piece together her life and break the curse before her impending death comes again. Fans of Once Upon A Time and The Vampire Diaries will fall head over heels for the desperate characters and endless mysteries in the Archers of Avalon Series!	495	June 10th 2010	Heather, Tristan Archer, Gabriel Archer, Scarlet Jacobs		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13334934-awry
