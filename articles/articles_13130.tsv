Middle School Is Worse Than Meatloaf: A Year Told Through Stuff	Ginny Davis #1	Jennifer L. Holm, Elicia Castaldi	3.79	3198	470	Ginny has ten items on her big to-do list for seventh grade. None of them, however, include accidentally turning her hair pink. Or getting sent to detention for throwing frogs in class. Or losing the lead role in the ballet recital to her ex-best friend. Or the thousand other things that can go wrong between September and June. But it looks like it's shaping up to be that kind of a year! Here's the story of one girl's worst school year ever -- told completely through her stuff.	128	July 24th 2006	Ginny Davis		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/708694.Middle_School_Is_Worse_Than_Meatloaf
