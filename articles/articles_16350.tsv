Midnight for Charlie Bone	The Children of the Red King #1	Jenny Nimmo	3.81	40500	1962	A magical fantasy that is fast-paced and easy-to-read. Charlie Bone has a special gift- he can hear people in photographs talking! The fabulous powers of the Red King were passed down through his descendants, after turning up quite unexpectedly, in someone who had no idea where they came from. This is what happened to Charlie Bone, and to some of the children he met behind the grim, gray walls of Bloor's Academy. His scheming aunts decide to send him to Bloor Academy, a school for geniuses where he uses his gifts to discover the truth despite all the dangers that lie ahead.	401	January 2002		Bloor's Academy (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9475.Midnight_for_Charlie_Bone
