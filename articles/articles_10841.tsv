The Boy Who Dared		Susan Campbell Bartoletti	4.01	13489	1957	A youth in Nazi Germany tells the truth about Hitler. Bartoletti has taken one episode from her Newbery Honor Book, Hitler Youth, and fleshed it out into a full novel. When 16-year-old Helmut Hubner listens to the BBC news on an illegal short-wave radio, he quickly discovers Germany is lying to the people. But when he tries to expose the truth with leaflets, he's tried for treason. Sentenced to death and waiting in a jail cell, Helmut's story emerges in a series of flashbacks that show his growth from a naive child caught up in the patriotism of the times, to a sensitive and mature young man who thinks for himself.	202	February 1st 2008	Karl-Heinz Schnibbe, Rudi Wobbe, Helmuth HÃ¼bener	Hamburg (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1967633.The_Boy_Who_Dared
