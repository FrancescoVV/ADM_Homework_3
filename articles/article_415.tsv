Death of a Salesman		Arthur  Miller	3.53	186840	4828	'For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to life. He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you medicine. He's a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine.' Willy Loman has been a salesman for 34 years. At 60, he is cast aside, his usefulness now exhausted. With no future to dream about he must face the crushing disappointments of his past. He takes one final brave action, but is he heroic at last?, or a self-deluding fool?	117	1949	Willy Loman, Linda Loman, Happy Loman, Biff Loman, Ben Loman, Howard Wagner	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12898.Death_of_a_Salesman
