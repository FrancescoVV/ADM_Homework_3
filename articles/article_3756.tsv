Skeleton Crew		Stephen King	3.96	108924	2094	From the Flap: The Master at his scarifying best! From heart-pounding terror to the eeriest of whimsy--tales from the outer limits of one of the greatest imaginations of our time! Evil that breathes and walks and shrieks, brave new worlds and horror shows, human desperation bursting into deadly menace--such are the themes of these astounding works of fiction. In the tradition of Poe and Stevenson, of Lovecraft and The Twilight Zone, Stephen King has fused images of fear as old as time with the iconography of contemporary American life to create his own special brand of horror--one that has kept millions of readers turning the pages even as they gasp. In the book-length story "The Mist," a supermarket becomes the last bastion of humanity as a peril beyond dimension invades the earth. . . Touch "The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands," and say your prayers . . . There are some things in attics which are better left alone, things like "The Monkey" . . . The most sublime woman driver on earth offers a man "Mrs. Todd's Shortcut" to paradise . . . A boy's sanity is pushed to the edge when he's left alone with the odious corpse of "Gramma" . . . If you were stunned by Gremlins, the Fornits of "The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet" will knock your socks off . . . Trucks that punish and beautiful teen demons who seduce a young man to massacre; curses whose malevolence grows through the years; obscene presences and angels of grace--here, indeed, is a night-blooming bouquet of chills and thrills.	612	June 21st 1985		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13440.Skeleton_Crew
