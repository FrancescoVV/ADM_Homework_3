We Got Zombies On The Lawn Again, Ma		Donnie  Smith	3.33	95	27	In this humorously irreverent take on zombies, Ax Handel is a present-day nineteen-year-old pizza delivery guy with a short fuse who is determined to take control of his wildly unpredictable life. His comical attempts to make sense of his relationships with his outrageous family members usually end up in disaster. Suddenly, his life changes—possibly for the better—when zombies stumble out of a nearby cemetery. Life has never been easy for Ax and his mother, and they refuse to be scared off by a horde of the dying impaired. Without any help from Ma, whose hard-living, heavy-metal past has left her strangely sympathetic to the plight of the zombies, or his volatile ex-girlfriend, Zenobia, who's certain he's a head case, or even his zoned-out fugitive father, it’s up to Ax to protect his little town of Karbunkle and what little he owns, while getting revenge on some bad-mannered, lumbering stiffs.	209	October 15th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20578084-we-got-zombies-on-the-lawn-again-ma
