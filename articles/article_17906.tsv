Autumn Trinity		Darren  Knight	5.00	1	0	What is it that you believe? That we evolved from the dark soiled quagmire and became a warring civilisation drowning in fear and control? Or that we were the creation of divinity, a spark of holy self? Would your tale sound any less enigmatic if it was not veiled in stale conformity by the ignorant masses? It is a blinding light to gaze into, to be aware of the truth without the lenses to see it clearly. All I can truly offer is the chronicle. You may find the space before and in between tells its own story in preferable comfort.	310	December 23rd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20366962-autumn-trinity
