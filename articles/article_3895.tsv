Armor		John Steakley	4.12	16842	881	The military sci-fi classic in a striking new package Felix is an Earth soldier, encased in special body armor designed to withstand Earth's most implacable enemy-a bioengineered, insectoid alien horde. But Felix is also equipped with internal mechanisms that enable him, and his fellow soldiers, to survive battle situations that would destroy a man's mind. This is a remarkable novel of the horror, the courage, and the aftermath of combat--and how the strength of the human spirit can be the greatest armor of all.	426	December 1984	Felix, Jack Crow, Hollis "Holly" Ware, Borglyn	Starship Terra, Banshee, Sanction	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102327.Armor
