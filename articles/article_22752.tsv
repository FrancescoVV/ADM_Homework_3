Conversations with Peter Rosei		Peter Rosei, Wilhelm Schwarz	5.00	1	0	During the summer 1990, Peter Rosei spent a few weeks on the author's farm at St. Isidore, Quebec. In the living room, during nature walks, during extended excursions, they held conversations which were, in part, recorded on a cassette and are presented in this work. Concentrating on Peter Rosei's works, poetics, intentions and problems, all conversations began with prepared questions, although the discussions occasionally were freed from that format and stood on their own merits. The exchanges sought to get Mr. Rosei's points of view and interpretations about his themes and characters, as well as his stand on literary and philosophical trends.	128	June 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2710628-conversations-with-peter-rosei
