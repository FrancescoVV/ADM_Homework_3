A Note of Madness	Flynn Laukonen #1	Tabitha Suzuma	3.93	923	124	Why is this happening to me? he asked himself desperately. What is wrong with me? Life as a student should be good for Flynn. He's one of the top pianists at the Royal College of Music, he has been put forward for an opportunity-of-a-lifetime concert, and he's got great friends. But beneath the surface, he's falling apart. On a good day he feels full of energy and life, but on a bad day being alive is worse than being dead. Sometimes he wants to compose and practice all night, at other times he can't get out of bed. With the pressure of the forthcoming concert and the growing concern of his family and friends, emotions come to a head. Sometimes things can only get worse before they get better.	305	February 15th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1822182.A_Note_of_Madness
