At first, giddy anticipation is in the air. Gallagher Academy, Cammie's elite spy school, is hosting a visit from a covert training center for boys. Soon after the boys' arrival, though, everything goes dangerously awry when a series of security breaches are discovered at the academy. Worse yet, teenage agent-in-training Cammie is being blamed for the penetration. With the school's top-secret status at risk, the Gallagher Girls have to work quickly to save their beloved school.	236	October 2nd 2007	Liz Sutton, Macey McHenry, Rebecca "Bex" Baxter, Zachary Goode, Cammie Morgan	Roseville, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568645.Cross_My_Heart_and_Hope_to_Spy
