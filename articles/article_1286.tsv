Ahab's Wife, or The Star-Gazer		Sena Jeter Naslund	4.03	42837	2712	A magnificent, vast, and enthralling saga, Sena Jeter Naslund's Ahab's Wife is a remarkable epic spanning a rich, eventful, and dramatic life. Inspired by a brief passage in Moby Dick , it is the story of Una, exiled as a child to live in a lighthouse, removed from the physical and emotional abuse of a religion-mad father. It is the romantic adventure of a young woman setting sail in a cabin boy's disguise to encounter darkness, wonder, and catastrophe; the story of a devoted wife who witnesses her husband's destruction by obsession and madness. Ultimately it is the powerful and moving story of a woman's triumph over tragedy and loss through her courage, creativity, and intelligence.	704	September 22nd 1999	Captain Ahab, Frederick Douglass, Una Spenser, Kit Sparrow, Giles Bonebright	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7742.Ahab_s_Wife_or_The_Star_Gazer
