Betsy and Tacy Go Over the Big Hill	Betsy-Tacy #3	Maud Hart Lovelace, Lois Lenski	4.18	8224	241	Betsy, Tacy, and Tib can't wait to be ten. After all, getting two numbers in your age is the beginning of growing upâ€”exciting things are bound to happen. And they do! The girls fall in love with the King of Spain, perform in the School Entertainment, and for the first time, go all the way over the Big Hill to Little Syria by themselves. There Betsy, Tacy, and Tib make new friends and learn a thing or two. They learn that new Americans are sometimes the best Americans. And they learn that they themselves wouldn't want to be anything else. Ever since their first publication in the 1940s, the Betsy-Tacy stories have been loved by each generation of young readers.	192	1942	Alfonso XIII of Spain, Betsy Ray, Tacy Kelly, Katie Kelly, Bee Kelly, Mrs. Ray (Betsy-Tacy), Robert Ray, Mrs. Kelly, Paul Kelly, Julia Ray, Mrs. Chubbock, Tib Muller, Hobbie Muller, Freddie Muller, Margaret Ray, Mrs. Ekstrom, Mrs. Benson, Mrs. Muller, Naifi Bushara, Old Bushara, Mr. Bushara, Keith Warrington	Deep Valley, Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7894.Betsy_and_Tacy_Go_Over_the_Big_Hill
