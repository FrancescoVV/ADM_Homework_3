Accompanied by a mysterious government agent, a brilliant young geneticist and his pet monkey, Ampersand, Yorick travels the world in search of his lost love and the answer to why he's the last man on earth. This Absolute Edition will feature the first twenty issues of this action-packed series along with special script pages, character sketchs and cover gallery.
