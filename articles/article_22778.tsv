Find You in Paris	The Darcy Brothers #1	Alix Nichols	3.52	1219	155	True spite. Fake marriage. Real romance. If there’s one man that fledgling art photographer Diane Petit really, really, actively hates, it’s fragrance mogul Sebastian Darcy who stole her father’s company—and wrecked the man’s health in the process. But the arrogant SOB had better brace himself because Diane has vowed revenge. And revenge she will have. - - Find You in Paris is a standalone contemporary romance inspired by Pride and Prejudice . Lots of laughs and steamy scenes, a touch of cozy mystery and a healthy dose of alpha billionaire romance. No cliffhangers. WARNING : Just like in Pride and Prejudice , expect to find one rich, brooding and handsome Mr. Darcy and one feisty small-town girl who can't stand him. Unlike Pride and Prejudice , this book also contains artful nude photos of said Mr. Darcy and nights of wild passion in Paris.	276	July 8th 2016	Sebastian Darcy, Raphael Darcy, Noah Darcy, Octave Bernard Rossi, Diane Petit, Chloe Petit, Charles Petit, Marguerite d’Arcy, Thibaud d'Arcy	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34321801-find-you-in-paris
