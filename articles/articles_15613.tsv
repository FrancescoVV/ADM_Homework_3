Halfway to Forever	Forever Faithful #3	Karen Kingsbury	4.45	3715	101	Halfway to Forever brings back two of Karen Kingsbury's favorite couples -- Waiting for Morning's Matt and Hannah, and Jade and Tanner from A Moment of Weakness -- who once again face traumatic issues. Matt and Hannah risk losing another daughter as they invest their emotions in a risky adoption, and Tanner dreads losing Jade when brain cancer threatens her first pregnancy. Kingsbury's latest heart-wringing novel tells of two familiar, beloved couples learning to depend on God daily, regardless of trials and troubles that mark the path halfway to forever.	344	April 2nd 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105435.Halfway_to_Forever
