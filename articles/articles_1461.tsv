Carpe Corpus	The Morganville Vampires #6	Rachel Caine	4.20	47205	1017	Read Rachel Caine's posts on the Penguin Blog In the small college town of Morganville, vampires and humans lived in (relative) peace-until all the rules got rewritten when the evil vampire Bishop arrived, looking for the lost book of vampire secrets. He's kept a death grip on the town ever since. Now an underground resistance is brewing, and in order to contain it, Bishop must go to even greater lengths. He vows to obliterate the town and all its inhabitants-the living and the undead. Claire Danvers and her friends are the only ones who stand in his way. But even if they defeat Bishop, will the vampires ever be content to go back to the old rules, after having such a taste of power?	241	January 1st 2009	Michael Glass, Shane Collins, Eve Rosser, Claire Danvers	Morganville, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5212771-carpe-corpus
