Him	Him & Her #1	Carey Heywood	3.72	9822	853	Sarah Miller hasn’t been home in seven years. She thought she could stay away forever. If it wasn’t for her big brother's wedding, that is. Part of her even feels silly for staying away this long. It's not like anyone even knew what happened. Well, except for him. That guy. The one she compared all others to. The one who set the bar so high no other guy after him could even compete. The one who made her feel like anything was possible. The one she thought she would never be good enough for. The one she spent the last seven years trying to forget. All she needs to do is make it through the next week without running into him.	314	June 21st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17668976-him
