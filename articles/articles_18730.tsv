Unassimilated		Michael Ben Zehabe	4.50	18	12	Updated cover edition found here . Zoe Mousa thinks immigrating to the U.S. is her key to happiness. After arriving, she works hard to repay an emotional debt owed to Sarah and Jamileh, two Muslim sisters who provided love and family after her Jewish parents were murdered in Iran. Despite Zoe’s best efforts, their reunion is sidetracked when she uncovers an emerging cyber war. Amidst the rising tensions, a young Christian professor takes a bold interest in Zoe, but he adds too many layers to her already complex life. When love and culture collide, her worst flaws surface. That’s when she realizes she’s not a victim of prejudice. She’s a perpetrator. Immigration isn’t the solution to everything. Her unrealistic expectations melt away with time and maturity. “Why did I bother to come,” Zoe asks. In a world on fire, maybe America is nothing more than the last burning house on the block.	300	August 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34996644-unassimilated
