The Second Sex	Le deuxième sexe #1-2	Simone de Beauvoir, H.M. Parshley, Deirdre Bair	4.12	30947	1416	Newly translated and unabridged in English for the first time, Simone de Beauvoir’s masterwork is a powerful analysis of the Western notion of “woman,” and a groundbreaking exploration of inequality and otherness. This long-awaited new edition reinstates significant portions of the original French text that were cut in the first English translation. Vital and groundbreaking, Beauvoir’s pioneering and impressive text remains as pertinent today as it was back then, and will continue to provoke and inspire generations of men and women to come.	746	1949			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457264.The_Second_Sex
