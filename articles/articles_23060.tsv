It's Trevor Noah: Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood (Adapted for Young Readers)		Trevor Noah	4.51	2347	324	The host of The Daily Show, Trevor Noah, tells the story of growing up half black, half white in South Africa under and after apartheid in this young readers' adaptation of his bestselling adult memoir Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood . Trevor Noah shares his story of growing up in South Africa, with a black South African mother and a white European father at a time when it was against the law for a mixed-race child like him to exist. But he did exist--and from the beginning, the often-misbehaved Trevor used his smarts and humor to navigate a harsh life under a racist government.	304	April 1st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40909450-it-s-trevor-noah
