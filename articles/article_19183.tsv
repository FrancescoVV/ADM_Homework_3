Just Like Animals	Werelock Evolution #5	Hettie Ivers	4.01	817	164	For ten long years, I stayed away to protect her. I thought I’d successfully subverted my wolf’s instincts where Bethany was concerned. But when I saw her on that dance floor, my inner beast took over. I told myself it would be just one dance. One dance and I’d let her go. I didn’t mean to bite her. Or f*ck her in the middle of a crowded dance club. Or kidnap her… again. *** Read an excerpt here ➜ https://bit.ly/2J8Gukt NOTE: "Just Like Animals is a fast-paced dirty ride" (to quote a reviewer). The romance between the main couple was written to work as a first read in the series for readers new to the Werelock Evolution world. However, please note that this is book number 5 within the Werelock Evolution series, so it also continues elements of the overarching storyline of the world.
