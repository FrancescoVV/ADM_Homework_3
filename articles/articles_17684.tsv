Attainment	Attainment #1	J.H. Cardwell	3.42	175	38	There are many ways to capture a person’s love, but unwilling, full attainment is never the best option. Life hasn’t been easy for 18 year old Reese Stanford. After a traumatic incident a year ago, she has a hard time trusting any guy. She finally allows herself to fall for the heart throb, Tate Justice, only to realize he too comes with his own set of issues. Swearing off men, she meets a beach ‘god’ who will settle for no less than all of Reese. That is at least, until she learns a truth about Tate that changes the game entirely.	247	July 19th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18223462-attainment
