The Good Girls	The Perfectionists #2	Sara Shepard	4.09	6695	975	Mackenzie, Ava, Caitlin, Julie, and Parker have done some not-so-perfect things. But even though they all talked about killing rich bully Nolan Hotchkiss, they didn’t actually go through with it. It’s just a coincidence that Nolan died in exactly the way they planned . . . right? Except Nolan wasn’t the only one they fantasized about killing. When someone else they named dies, the girls wonder if they’re being framed. Or are they about to become the killer’s next targets?	368	June 2nd 2015		Beacon Heights, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23171368-the-good-girls
