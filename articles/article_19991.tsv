Flood	Flood #1	Stephen Baxter	3.59	4924	522	It begins in 2016. Another wet summer, another year of storm surges and high tides. But this time the Thames Barrier is breached and central London is swamped. The waters recede, life goes on, the economy begins to recover, people watch the news reports of other floods around the world. And then the waters rise again. And again. Lily, Helen, Gary and Piers, hostages released from five years captivity at the hands of Christian Extremists in Spain, return to England and the first rumours of a flood of positively Biblical proportions… Sea levels have begun to rise, at catastrophic speed. Within two years London and New York will be under water. The Pope will give his last address from the Vatican before Rome is swallowed by the rising water. Mecca too will vanish beneath the waves. The world is drowning. A desperate race to find out what is happening begins. The popular theory is that we are paying the price for our profligacy and that climate change is about to redress Gaia’s balance. But there are dissenting views. And all the time the waters continue to rise and mankind begins the great retreat to higher ground. Millions will die, billions will become migrants. Wars will be fought over mountains.	536	July 17th 2008	Piers Michaelmas, Helen Gray, Gary Boyle, George Camden, Lily Brooke	Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain), London, England (United Kingdom), Houston, Texas (United States), Reykjavik (Reykjavík) , 2017 (Iceland) New York City, New York , 2018 (United States) Cusco (Peru), Reykjavik (Reykjavík) (Iceland), New York City, New York (United States), Cusco (Peru)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2111634.Flood
