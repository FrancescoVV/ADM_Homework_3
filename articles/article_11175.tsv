Don't Call Me Ishmael!	Ishmael Leseur #1	Michael Gerard Bauer	3.61	1782	204	There's no easy way to put this, so I'll say it straight out. It's time I faced up to the truth. I'm fourteen years old and I have Ishmael Leseur's Syndrome. There is no cure. And there is no instant cure to not fitting in. But that won't stop Ishmael and his intrepid band of misfits from taking on bullies, bugs, babes, the Beatles, debating, and the great white whale in the toughest, the weirdest, the most embarrassingly awful...and the best year of their lives.	277	2006		Australia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/683406.Don_t_Call_Me_Ishmael_
