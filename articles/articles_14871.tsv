Undead and Unworthy	Undead #7	MaryJanice Davidson	3.81	14419	504	Betsy Taylor thought entering the world of the undead was a big adjustment. Being a new bride isn't much easier. The blush has only been on for two months, and Betsy has a lot to do: set up the new house, finish writing thank-you notes, and raise BabyJon, her half brother and legal ward. Just another happy American family adjusting to marital bliss. Betsy's husband, Sinclair, has been perusing the Book of the Dead, and Betsy's visited by a ghost who's even more insufferable, stubborn, and annoying in death than she was in life. She not only blames Betsy for her condition but insists she fix it. It's all just a prelude to the fun and games awaiting Betsy and Sinclair when a pack of formerly feral vampires, hungry for blood and power, pays a visit to the happy couple.	285	June 24th 2008	Tina, Elizabeth "Betsy" Taylor, Eric Sinclair, Nick Berry, Antonia (The "Ant") Taylor, Garret Shea aka George, Antonia Wolfton, Dr. Marc Spangler, Jessica Watson, Laura Goodman (Undead)	St. Paul, Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2255114.Undead_and_Unworthy
