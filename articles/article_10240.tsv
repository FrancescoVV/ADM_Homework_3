Tuesday		David Wiesner	4.15	25674	2175	A Caldecott classic celebrating twenty years in print. David Wiesner received the 1991 Caldecott Medal for Tuesday . In the years that followed, he went on to receive two more Caldecotts, and Tuesday went on to sell half a million copies in the United States and to be published in a dozen foreign countries. Now, with remarkable advances in the technology of color reproduction, the original artwork for Tuesday is being reproduced anew, for an edition even more faithful to the palette and texture of David Wiesnerâ€™s watercolor paintings. The whimsical account of a Tuesday when frogs were airborne on their lily pads will continue to enchant readers of all ages.	32	April 22nd 1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97860.Tuesday
