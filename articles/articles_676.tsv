The Magic Mountain		Thomas Mann, John E. Woods	4.10	38202	2252	In this dizzyingly rich novel of ideas, Mann uses a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a community devoted exclusively to sickness, as a microcosm for Europe, which in the years before 1914 was already exhibiting the first symptoms of its own terminal irrationality. The Magic Mountain is a monumental work of erudition and irony, sexual tension and intellectual ferment, a book that pulses with life in the midst of death.	706	1924	Hans Castorp, Ludovico Settembrini, Joachim Ziemssen, Hermine Kleefeld, Clavdia Chauchat, Pieter Peeperkorn	Switzerland, Italy, Davos (Switzerland), Hamburg (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88077.The_Magic_Mountain
