Spoiled	Spoiled #1	Heather Cocks, Jessica  Morgan	3.56	5880	756	You say Spoiled like it's a bad thing. Sixteen-year-old Molly Dix has just discovered that her biological father is Brick Berlin, world-famous movie star and red-carpet regular. Intrigued (and a little) terrified by her Hollywood lineage, Molly moves to Los Angeles and plunges headfirst into the deep of Beverly Hills celebrity life. Just as Molly thinks her life couldn't get any stranger, she meets Brooke Berlin, her gorgeous, spoiled half-sister, who welcomes Molly to la-la land with a smothering dose of "sisterly love"...but in this town, nothing is ever what it seems. Set against a world of Redbull-fuelled stylists, tiny tanned girls, popped-collar guys, and Blackberry-wielding publicists, Spoiled is a sparkling debut from the writers behind the viciously funny celebrity blog GoFugYourself.com.	368	June 1st 2011	Molly Dix, Brooke Berlin, Brick Berlin	Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9415966-spoiled
