Rich Boy Cries for Momma		Ethan H. Minsker	4.80	30	11	Rich Boy Cries for Momma is a memoir from the perspective of a teenage punk rocker in Washington D.C. The story begins here, in the middle of Washington's punk and hardcore music scene of the 70's and 80's. Filled with mayhem, teenaged romance, and substance abuse, the story focuses on the young, unnamed protagonist who is diagnosed with a learning disability. Despite a firm upper-middle class standing being the child of two prominent D.C. lawyers, Rich Boy Cries for Momma invites the reader to the allure of counterculture and to the truth that can only lead to disenchantment.	338	September 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17233495-rich-boy-cries-for-momma
