For a policeman, there can be few things worse than a serial killer at loose in your city. Except, perhaps, a serial killer who targets coppers, and a city on the brink of bloody revolution. The people have found their voice at last, the flags and barricades are rising...And the question for a policeman, an officer of the law, a defender of the peace, is: Are you with them, or are you against them?	480	November 2002	Nobby Nobbs, Carrot Ironfoundersson, Sam Vimes, Young Sam Vimes, Havelock Vetinari, Sybil Deidre Olgivanna Ramkin, DEATH, Cheery Littlebottom, Reg Shoe, Detritus, Monks of History, Buggy Swires, Fred Colon, Lu-Tze, John Keel	Ankh-Morpork, Discworld	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47989.Night_Watch
