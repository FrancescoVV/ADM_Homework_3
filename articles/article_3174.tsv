Rock Chick	Rock Chick #1	Kristen Ashley	4.18	53111	4017	Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old. No matter what ingenious schemes Indy used to capture his attention, Lee never showed an interest and Indy finally gave up. Now Indy's employee, Rosie, has lost a bag of diamonds and bad guys are shooting at him. When Indy gets involved, Lee is forced to help. Complicating matters, Lee has decided he's interested, Indy's decided she's not. But she can't seem to keep Lee out of her life when she's repeatedly stun gunned, kidnapped and there are car bombs exploding (not to mention she's finding dead bodies). Indy's best bet is to solve the mystery of the diamonds before Lee. Lee's challenge is to keep Indy alive and, at the same time, win back her heart.	412	December 1st 2008	India "Indy" Savage, Liam "Lee" Nightingale, Allyson "Ally" Nightingale, Henry "Hank" Nightingale, Edward "Eddie" Chavez	Denver, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6538757-rock-chick
