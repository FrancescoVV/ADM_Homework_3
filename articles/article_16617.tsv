The Darwin Awards: Evolution in Action	Darwin Awards #1	Wendy Northcutt	3.64	4356	295	"Only two things are infinite-the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not so sure about the universe." -Albert Einstein Named in honor of Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, The Darwin Awards vividly portrays the finest examples of evolution in action, and shows us just how uncommon common sense can be. Marvel at the thief who steals electrical wires without shutting off the current. Gape at the lawnchair jockey who floats to a height of 16,000 feet suspended by helium balloons. Learn from the man who peers into a gasoline can using a cigarette lighter. All three -- and many more -- contend for Darwin Awards when their choices culminate in magnificent misadventures. These tales of trial and awe-inspiring error--verified by the author and endorsed by website readers--illustrate the ongoing saga of survival of the fittest in all its selective glory.	352	2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63803.The_Darwin_Awards
