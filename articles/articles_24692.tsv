Sucks to Be Me: The All-True Confessions of Mina Hamilton, Teen Vampire (maybe)	Sucks to Be Me #1	Kimberly Pauley	3.73	6500	485	Mina Hamilton's parents want her dead. (Or undead to be precise.) They're vampires, and like it or not, Mina must decide whether to become a vampire herself. But Mina's more interested in hanging out with best friend Serena and trying to catch the eye of the too-hot-for-high-school Nathan Able than in the vampire training classes she's being forced to take. How's a girl supposed to find the perfect prom date and pass third-year French when her mom and dad are breathing down her neck--literally?	293	August 26th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2506250.Sucks_to_Be_Me
