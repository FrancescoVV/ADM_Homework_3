Good in Bed	Cannie Shapiro #1	Jennifer Weiner	3.73	280371	5952	Weiner's witty, original, fast-moving debut features a lovable heroine, a solid cast, snappy dialogue and a poignant take on life's priorities. For twenty-eight years, things have been tripping along nicely for Cannie Shapiro. Sure, her mother has come charging out of the closet, and her father has long since dropped out of her world. But she loves her friends, her rat terrier, Nifkin, and her job as pop culture reporter for The Philadelphia Examiner. She's even made a tenuous peace with her plus-size body. But the day she opens up a national women's magazine and sees the words "Loving a Larger Woman" above her ex-boyfriend's byline, Cannie is plunged into misery...and the most amazing year of her life. From Philadelphia to Hollywood and back home again, she charts a new course for herself: mourning her losses, facing her past, and figuring out who she is and who she can become.	376	2001	Candace 'Cannie' Shapiro, Bruce Guberman, Samantha, Dr. Peter Kruchelevansky, Maxi Ryder	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14748.Good_in_Bed
