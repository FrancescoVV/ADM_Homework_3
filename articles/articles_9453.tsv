Beauty from Love	Beauty #3	Georgia Cates	4.13	16124	965	The epic romance between an all-American beauty and her Aussie continues in this final installment of The Beauty Series. Jack McLachlan is fulfilled by more than he dared to dream possible. He finds everything he never knew he wanted—or needed—in Laurelyn Prescott, his last and final companion. Life is beautiful with his beloved by his side but their post-wedded bliss is cut short when his dark past springs into their present happiness. He wants to shelter Laurelyn but keeping her untainted by his previous life proves impossible when yesterday’s sins insist on returning to haunt him. Will it be possible for them to find happiness in their forever with a past like his? Beauty From Love is an adult contemporary novel and is not intended for younger readers due to mature content.	292	January 28th 2014	Jack Henry McLachlan, Laurelyn Prescott		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18005373-beauty-from-love
