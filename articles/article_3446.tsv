The King	Black Dagger Brotherhood #12	J.R. Ward	4.37	48174	4562	Long live the King... After turning his back on the throne for centuries, Wrath, son of Wrath, finally assumed his father’s mantle—with the help of his beloved mate. But the crown sets heavily on his head. As the war with the Lessening Society rages on, and the threat from the Band of Bastards truly hits home, he is forced to make choices that put everything—and everyone—at risk. Beth Randall thought she knew what she was getting into when she mated the last pure blooded vampire on the planet: An easy ride was not it. But when she decides she wants a child, she’s unprepared for Wrath’s response—or the distance it creates between them. The question is, will true love win out... or tortured legacy take over?	591	April 1st 2014	Selena, Beth (Elizabeth) Randall, Xcor, Layla (Chosen) (Black Dagger), Marisol (Sola) Morte, Trez, iAm, Wrath (Blind King), Assail, son of Assail	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108281-the-king
