Thousand Cranes		Yasunari Kawabata, Edward G. Seidensticker	3.76	9207	802	An alternate cover of this ISBN can be found here . Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata’s Thousand Cranes is a luminous story of desire, regret, and the almost sensual nostalgia that binds the living to the dead. While attending a traditional tea ceremony in the aftermath of his parents’ deaths, Kikuji encounters his father’s former mistress, Mrs. Ota. At first Kikuji is appalled by her indelicate nature, but it is not long before he succumbs to passion—a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences, not just for the two lovers, but also for Mrs. Ota’s daughter, to whom Kikuji’s attachments soon extend. Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning.	147	1952	Kikuji, Mrs. Ota, Fumiko	Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14027.Thousand_Cranes
