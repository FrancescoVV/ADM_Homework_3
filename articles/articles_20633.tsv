Please forgive me		Melissa Hill	3.73	2414	167	Have you ever dreamed of running away? Of just leaving the past behind you? Leonie has done just that. She’s moved to another country and got a new job, a new home, a brand new life. . . But when she discovers a box of unread love letters in the bottom of her wardrobe, all ending with the words ‘please forgive me’, she finds herself drawn to the mystery behind them. Can the unravelling of another person’s story help Leonie deal with her own past and her own secrets? All she knows is that she has to try. Because if the couple behind the love letters had a happy ending, then perhaps she just might too.	384	2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6695435-please-forgive-me
