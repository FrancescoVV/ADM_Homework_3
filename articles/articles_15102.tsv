A quest for the Great Ga'Hoole Tree, a mythical place where each night an order of owls rises to perform noble deeds. There Soren, Gylfie, Twilight, and Digger hope to find inspiration to fight the evil that dwells in the owl kingdom. The journey is long and harrowing. When Soren and his friends finally arrive at the Great Ga'Hoole Tree, they will be tested in ways they never dreamed and face challenges they never imagined. If they can learn from their leaders and from one another, they will soon become true Ga'hoolian owls-honest and brave, wise and true.	242	July 31st 2003	Martin (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Ruby (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Digger (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Primrose (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Soren (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Gylfie, Twilight (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Ezylryb, Octavia (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Mrs. Plithiver, Eglantine, Boron, Barran, Poot, Bubo, Madame Plonk, Otulissa		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35806.The_Journey
