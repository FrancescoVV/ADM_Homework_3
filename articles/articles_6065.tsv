The Iron King	The Accursed Kings #1	Maurice Druon, Humphrey Hare	4.03	15518	1148	The Iron King - Philip the Fair - is as cold and silent, as handsome and unblinking as a statue. He governs his realm with an iron hand, but he cannot rule his own family: his sons are weak and their wives adulterous; while his red-blooded daughter Isabella is unhappily married to an English king who prefers the company of men. A web of scandal, murder and intrigue is weaving itself around the Iron King; but his downfall will come from an unexpected quarter. Bent on the persecution of the rich and powerful Knights Templar, Philip sentences Grand Master Jacques Molay to be burned at the stake, thus drawing down upon upon himself a curse that will destroy his entire dynasty ...	368	April 25th 1955	Philippe IV of France, Louis X of France, Charles IV of France, Enguerrand de Marigny, Isabella of France, Marguerite of Burgundy, queen of France, Jeanne II of Burgundy, queen of France, Blanche of Burgundy, Mahaut d'Artois, Robert d'Artois, Jacques de Molay, Philippe V of France, Charles, count of Valois, Louis, Count d'Ã‰vreux, Edward III of England, Philip the Fair, Louis, King of Navarre, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, Philippe, Count de Poitiers, Robert d'Artois, Mahaut d'Artois, Jeanne, Countess de Poitiers, Charles, Count of La Marche, Blanche of Burgundy, Isabella, Queen of England, She-Wolf of France, Jacques de Molay, The Knights Templar, Charles de Valois, Edward II of England	France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16117911-the-iron-king
