Forever Mine	The Moreno Brothers #1	Elizabeth Reyes	3.87	23046	1039	Seventeen-year old Sarah’s life is turned upside down when her single mom is sent to jail. She’s forced to move, leaving behind everything she’s ever known, including her best friend Sydney. Lost and bitter in a new school, her one goal is to save money and move back home. Then she meets Angel Moreno. Enigmatic but gorgeous, Angel is almost too good to be true. Except for one thing, his archaic belief that guys and girls can never be “just friends”. The problem? Sarah’s best friend Sydney is not a girl. With their unexpected romance intensifying to places neither ever experienced, how long can Sarah keep Angel in the dark about the guy waiting for her back home? And you haven't already, read the Forever Mine mini prequel on my blog!	335	September 6th 2010	Sarah Parker, Angel Moreno (Left of Dead), Eric Diego, Sofia Moreno, Alex Moreno, Ramon Romero, Valerie Zuniga, Sal Moreno	La Jolla, San Diego, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15732569-forever-mine
