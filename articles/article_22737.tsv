#Nerd	Hashtag #1	Cambria Hebert	4.00	17578	1850	Two people from completely different worlds are about to be thrown together... In more ways than one. She wants to keep her scholarship. He wants to stay on the team. An awkward alliance doesn't even begin to cover Rimmel and Romeo's relationship. But that's about to change. It starts with a dare. An initiation. A challenge. Quickly, it turns into more. But when you're a victim of your status, there is no room for anything real. The rules are clear and simple. Stick to your circle. And never fall in love with anyone on the outside.	530	November 1st 2014	Rimmel, Romeo	Maryland (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23493256-nerd
