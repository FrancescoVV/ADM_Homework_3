Waiting for You		Susane Colasanti	3.84	21852	871	At the beginning of her sophomore year, Marisa is ready for a fresh start and, more importantly, a boyfriend. So when the handsome and popular Derek asks her out, Marisa thinks her long wait for happiness is over. But several bumps in the road—including her parents’ unexpected separation, a fight with her best friend, and a shocking disappointment in her relationship with Derek—test Marisa’s ability to maintain her new outlook. Only the anonymous DJ, whose underground podcasts have the school’s ear, seems to understand what Marisa is going through. But she has no idea who he is—or does she? In Waiting For You , Marisa learns how to “be in the Now” and realises that the love she’s been waiting for has been right in front of her all along.	320	May 14th 2009	Derek (Waiting for You), Nash (Waiting for You), Marisa (Waiting for You), Sterling (Waiting for You)	Far Hills, Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5168517-waiting-for-you
