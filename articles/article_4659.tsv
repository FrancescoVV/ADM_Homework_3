Book of Shadows	Wicca #1	Cate Tiernan	4.03	23753	1385	Something is happening to me that I don't understand. I see things, feel things in a new way. I can do things normal people can't do. Powerful things. Magical things. It scares me. I never chose to learn witchcraft. But I'm starting to wonder if witchcraft is choosing me.	176	January 29th 2001	Robbie Gurevitch, Morgan Rowlands, Calhoun Blaire, Bree Warren, Raven Meltzer, Mary Grace Rowlands, Mary Kathleen Rowlands, Alyce Fernbrake, David Redfern, Sean Rowlands	Widow's Vale, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/675614.Book_of_Shadows
