When Hollywood lawyer Jerry Vincent is murdered, Haller inherits his biggest case yet: the defense of Walter Elliott, a prominent studio executive accused of murdering his wife and her lover. But as Haller prepares for the case that could launch him into the big time, he learns that Vincent's killer may be coming for him next. Enter Harry Bosch. Determined to find Vincent's killer, he is not opposed to using Haller as bait. But as danger mounts and the stakes rise, these two loners realize their only choice is to work together. Bringing together Michael Connelly's two most popular characters, The Brass Verdict is sure to be his biggest book yet.	422	October 14th 2008	Hieronymus "Harry" Bosch, Mickey Haller, Jack McEvoy, Lorna Taylor, Dennis "Cisco" Wojciechowski, Maggie McPherson, Jerry Vincent, Patrick Henson, Nina Albrecht, Jeffrey Golantz, Malcolm Pepin, Joanne Giorgetti, Angel Romero, Bruce Carlin, Hayley Haller, Julie Favreau, John Kinder, Walter Elliot, Mary Townes Holder, Shamiram Arslanian	Los Angeles, California (United States), California (United States), Hollywood, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2761626-the-brass-verdict
