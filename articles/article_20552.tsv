I Dare You: Embrace Life with Passion		Joyce Meyer	4.23	1022	62	Joyce Meyer explains that a life without purpose is a life not worth living. We all need a reason to get up everyday. We all need to reach for something beyond ourselves. Over the centuries, millions of people have asked, "What am I here for? What is my purpose?" We are born; we live; and we die. We cannot do anything about being born or dying, but we can do a lot about how we live.	320	January 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1420902.I_Dare_You
