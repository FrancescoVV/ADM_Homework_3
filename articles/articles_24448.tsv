Taliessin Through Logres and the Region of the Summer Stars		Charles  Williams, SÃ¸rina Higgins	4.15	141	14	When Taliessin through Logres was published in 1938, it received widespread critical acclaim. Alongside its partner companion The Region of the Summer Stars, it stands as one of the most profound and challenging works in Williams' body of work--and one of the most important to understanding him fully. In this new edition, both Taliessin through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars are found together, with a new introduction by Williams scholar SOrina Higgins. Taliessin through Logres is designed to reward multiple readings. The poetry is technically virtuosic, musically beautiful, and conceptually complex. It is densely packed with layers of symbolism and rich imagery that are not initially easy to understand, but that scintillate with ever greater brilliance upon repeated readings. --from the Introduction by SOrina Higgins Some of the most fascinating poetry written in our time. Taliessin through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars contain (Williams') Grail poems, a reworking of the theme of the Holy Grail into a poetic myth of unusual wisdom and contemporary significance. It is a unique handling, a fresh vision, of an old subject-matter which has been almost completely neglected in English literature." --C.P. Crowley The more I read Taliessin through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, the more rewarding I find them.... Charles Williams has his own mythology which a reader must master. --W.H. Auden		1974	Taliessin, King Arthur	Logres (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/408832.Taliessin_through_Logres_The_Region_of_the_Summer_Stars_and_Arthurian_Torso
