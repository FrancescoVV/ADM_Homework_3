The Long Haul	Diary of a Wimpy Kid #9	Jeff Kinney	4.35	53514	3480	A family road trip is supposed to be a lot of fun . . . unless, of course, you’re the Heffleys. The journey starts off full of promise, then quickly takes several wrong turns. Gas station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender, and a runaway pig—not exactly Greg Heffley’s idea of a good time. But even the worst road trip can turn into an adventure—and this is one the Heffleys won’t soon forget.	224	November 4th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535019-the-long-haul
