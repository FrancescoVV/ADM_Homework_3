Hunters of Satan's Monsters (Legend of the Rolling Calf, #1)		Horace S. Mallette	5.00	4	3	It is a science fiction, supernatural thriller. It is about a man who, after living for forty years, realizes he is only ten years old—being that he was born on a leap day—and belongs to an order of supernatural beings who live for as long as three hundred years. These beings work alongside humankind and other hybrid beings in a secret organization that is set up worldwide to defend humanity from the various evils that traverse the earth. He is recruited and trained to use his special powers that start to manifest themselves on the eve of his fortieth (or tenth leap year) birthday. He loses his wife because of the organization’s secrecy policy and manipulation. He is brokenhearted and pressured to deal with the new revelation about himself and finds that he is falling in love with one of his own kind. They discover there could be treachery within the secret organization, but before they could disclose it, one of the organization locations where he is at is mysteriously teleported to another realm, where he and the team—which could include a traitor or traitors—goes head-on against demons and monsters.	154	November 19th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23551006-hunters-of-satan-s-monsters
