The Creation of Me, Them and Us		Heather  Marsh	4.44	16	0	From the author of Binding Chaos, this book brings us back to the beginning. The beginning of designing a better method of governance and way of living is to look at the structure of our self. The scope and originality of this book present a radical challenge to a seldom examined worldview. With an extremely wide reach and richness of detail, The Creation of Me, Them and Us sets the stage for further discussions of institutional reform by tackling the fundamental questions of who are we, what do we want, and why do we act the way we do? These questions (and answers) are fundamental in understanding a world that may seem incomprehensible today.	437	January 8th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50391716-the-creation-of-me-them-and-us
