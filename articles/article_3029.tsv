Caged		Shanna Ehrlich, Brittany Aldana	3.70	387	46	While on vacation, Annie begins a scandalous affair with Braxton Cage, a crime syndicate underboss hiding behind the facade of an upstanding businessman. She knows he's dangerous, but his secrets and power allure her; she's not so innocent herself. They fall hard and fast for each other, but at the end of the week she knows it's time to go home. The fantasy can't last forever. If he felt the same, maybe things would have turned out different. Maybe he wouldn't have had to break her. Maybe love isn't patient, or kind. **Disclaimer: Due to graphic sexual and violent situations, this book is intended for mature audiences only. Full length standalone novel.	554	July 25th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31215933-caged
