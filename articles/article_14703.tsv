The Stars for a Light	Cheney Duvall, M.D. #1	Lynn   Morris, Gilbert Morris	4.12	2495	106	No Medical School Ever Could Have prepared Cheney for Her First Position Graduating from the WomanÂ’s Medical College of the prestigious University of Pennsylvania as a full-fledged, documented, accredited physician, young and energetic Cheney Duvall assumed that she would immediately find a suitable position. But after two months of applying and interviewing for several different openings, then being summarily rejected because she was a woman, she had almost given up hope. When Cheney hears that a man named Asa Mercer is looking for a doctor to care for the two hundred women he is transporting on an extended sea voyage from New York to Washington Territory, she grabs the position. Mercer is actually delighted that Cheney is a female doctor who can also help chaperone these potential brides-to-be for the frontiersmen in the West. But even before the journey begins, a foreboding shadow darkens what Cheney had thought was a great opportunity to finally use her talents and education. Was she really prepared for what this responsibility requires?	315	May 1st 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/876361.The_Stars_for_a_Light
