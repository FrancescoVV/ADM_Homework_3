Tiny Deaths		Robert Shearman	4.39	207	32	Analyzing the complexity, absurdity, and blessedness of seemingly ordinary people, this debut collection examines the metaphysical assumptions surrounding death. From the end of a relationship to the meaning behind its title, this anthology continually surprises and subverts, utilizing topics such as alien intelligence, reincarnation, imaginary children, and even conversations with Hitlerâ€™s childhood pet. Engaging and diverse, this compendium offers a fascinating perspective on mortality.	224	November 23rd 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2252204.Tiny_Deaths
