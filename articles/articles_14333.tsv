Blandings Castle	Blandings Castle #3	P.G. Wodehouse	4.17	3907	291	Fans of P. G. Wodehouse's comic genius are legion, and their devotion to his masterful command of hilarity borders on obsession. Overlook happily feeds the obsession with four more antic selections from the master. Blandings Castle is a collection of tales concerning Lord Emsworth and the Threepwood clan, while Jeeves in the Offing finds Bertie Wooster in yet another scrape-with the peerless Jeeves out of sight, on vacation! Poor Bertie nearly becomes unstuck! Young Men in Spats is Wodehouse at his most sparkling: stories concerning members of the inimitable Drones Club-they may be small of brain and short on cash but they are always good for ingenious adventures. And in The Luck of the Bodkins, the action spans London, New York, Hollywood, and several transatlantic liners, as three dapper young men find themselves in various Wodehousian predicaments concerning their love lives and finances. Each volume has been reset and printed on Scottish cream-wove, acid-free paper, sewn and bound in cloth. These novels are elegant and essential additions to any Wodehouse fan's library.	301	April 12th 1935	Clarence Threepwood, Sebastian Beach, Constance Keeble, Freddie Threepwood, Roberta Wickham, Lady Wickham, Rupert Bingham, Mr. Mulliner, Miss Postlethwaite, Mabel Potter, Angus McAllister, Niagara Donaldson, Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, Blandings Hope, Mr. Donaldson, Mrs. Twemlow, Jane Yorke, Pauline Petite, Empress of Blandings, George Cyril Wellbeloved, Evans, Dr. Smithers, Lord Heacham, James Bartholomew Belford, Meeker, Fred Patzel, Gorgiana Alcester, Orlo Watkins, Bottles, Ern, Ebenezer Sprockett, John Rossiter, John Hamilton Potter, Clifford Gandle, Algernon P.
