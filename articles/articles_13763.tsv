The Girl With Glass Feet		Ali Shaw	3.41	7073	1037	Strange things are happening on the remote and snowbound archipelago of St. Haudaâ€™s Land. Magical winged creatures flit around the icy bogland, albino animals hide themselves in the snow-glazed woods, and Ida Maclaird is slowly turning into glass. Ida is an outsider in these parts who has only visited the islands once before. Yet during that one fateful visit the glass transformation began to take hold, and now she has returned in search of a cure.	292	May 1st 2009	Ida Maclaird, Midas Crook, Henry Fuwa		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6063110-the-girl-with-glass-feet
