Eat That Frog! Action Workbook: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time		Brian Tracy	4.07	389	63	The workbook version of this international bestseller guides you through getting more of the important things done. You'll stop procrastinating and start eating those frogs in no time! There's an old saying that if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you're done with the worst thing you'll have to do all day. For Brian Tracy, eating a frog is a metaphor for tackling your most challenging task--but also the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life. Eat That Frog! shows you how to organize each day so you can zero in on these critical tasks and accomplish them efficiently and effectively. The core of what is vital to effective time management is: decision, discipline, and determination. This workbook puts the ideas of the original book into action. By following the same twenty-one-chapter format as the book, each chapter includes exercises for you to reflect on your own habits. You'll also learn through the experience of a narrative character who is struggling with procrastination in her work and home life and uses Eat That Frog! to improve her time management performance.	144	July 24th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32471928-eat-that-frog-action-workbook
