The Recognition Sutras: Illuminating a 1,000-Year-Old Spiritual Masterpiece		Christopher D. Wallis	4.77	93	9	One of the most powerful and revelatory spiritual masterpieces of world history, the Pratyabhijnahridayam is one of the primary sources for the study and practice of nondual Tantrik Yoga, and it has never been accurately translated or fully explained until now. One thousand years ago in the valley of Kashmir, a great Tantric master named Ksemaraja wrote his masterpiece: the Pratyabhijnahridayam, which means “The Essence of the Recognition Philosophy”. This text was a concise primer, written to introduce spiritual seekers to the Recognition philosophy in less formally philosophical, more approachable language. What Ksemaraja created turned out to be one of the world’s great spiritual masterpieces, breathtaking in its brevity but stunning in its power. It came to be considered equivalent to scripture itself by later generations, because of its undeniable inspiration. This book expounds the subtleties of this spiritual and philosophical classic.	544	October 6th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35721264-the-recognition-sutras
