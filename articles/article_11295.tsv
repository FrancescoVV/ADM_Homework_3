Searching for Dragons	Enchanted Forest Chronicles #2	Patricia C. Wrede, Peter de SÃ¨ve	4.26	41047	1135	Kidnap a dragon? How daring! How stupid Cimorene, the princess who refuses to be proper, is back--but where is Kazul the dragon? That's what Cimorene is determined to find out. Luckily--or perhaps not -so-luckily--she's got help: Mendenbar, the not-very-kingly King of the Enchanted Forest, has joined her in her quest. So with the aid of a broken-down magic carpet, a leaky magical sword, and a few buckets of soapy lemon water, they set off across the Enchanted Forest to tackle the dragon-napping and save the King of the Dragons.	242	October 15th 1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169875.Searching_for_Dragons
