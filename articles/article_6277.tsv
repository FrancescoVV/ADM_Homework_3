A Pocket Full of Rye	Miss Marple #7	Agatha Christie	3.87	30286	1391	A handful of grain is found in the pocket of a murdered businessman! Rex Fortescue, king of a financial empire, was sipping tea in his 'counting house' office when he suffered an agonising and sudden death. On later inspection, the pockets of the deceased were found to contain traces of the said cereals. Yet, it was another incident, this time in the parlour at his home, which confirmed Jane Marple's suspicion that here she was looking at a case of crime by rhyme!	220	November 9th 1953	Rex Fortescue, Percival Fortescue, Lancelot Fortescue, Adele Fortescue, Pat Fortescue, Elaine Fortescue, Jennifer Fortescue, Mary Dove, Detective Inspector Neele, Gladys Martin, Vivian Dubois, Miss Ramsbottom, Irene Grosvenor, Gerald Wright, Mr. and Mrs. Crump, Sergeant Hay, Miss Marple, Professor Bernsdorff, Albert Evans, Helen MacKenzie, Mr. Billingsley	London, England (United Kingdom), St. Mary Mead, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/834378.A_Pocket_Full_of_Rye
