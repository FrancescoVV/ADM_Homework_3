A Dog's Way Home		Bobbie Pyron	4.21	1889	221	Daddy says, "Most folks got a north star in their life—something that gives their life extra meaning. Mine is music." Without even thinking, I say, "Mine is Tam." Abby knows that Tam, her Shetland sheepdog, is her north star, and she's pretty certain she's his, too. But when an accident separates Abby and Tam, it feels as though all the stars have fallen out of the sky and nothing will ever be right again. As the days between them turn to weeks, then months, dangers and changes fill up Abby's and Tam's lives. Will they ever find their way home to each other? Set in the Blue Ridge Mountains, A Dog's Way Home is an unforgettable tale of the many miles, months, and mountains that divide two loyal friends—but that can't possibly keep them apart.	321	January 1st 2011		Blue Ridge Mountains (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8875715-a-dog-s-way-home
