Suave Man Blues		T.D. Mulhern	3.88	16	2	Suave Man Blues is a transgressive fiction novel that follows the gradual self-destruction of one man. After losing his dead-end job and his woman, the main character's alcoholic tendencies lead him to dark places, both mentally and physically, as he travels around the western regions of the United States. Using the raw, sarcastic, over-opinionated and self-loathing views of the narrator, Suave Man Blues takes you unsparingly through the alcoholic mind while showing you the dirtier side of this great country we call America.	224	June 14th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27919611-suave-man-blues
