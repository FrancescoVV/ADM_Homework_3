Shine Not Burn	Shine Not Burn #1	Elle Casey	4.04	22258	2056	IT HAPPENED IN VEGAS. I can't be held responsible. Things that happen there are supposed to stay there, right? Right? Yeeeah. Not so much. Andie's just days away from tying the knot, but there's just ooooone little glitch. Apparently, she's already married. Or someone with her name is married to a guy out in Oregon of all places, and the courthouse won't issue her a marriage license until it's all cleared up. Tripping her way through cow pies and country songs to meet up with a man who gets around places on horseback is her very last idea of how to have a good time, but if she's going to get married, make partner at the firm, and have two point five kids before she's thirty-five, she needs to get to the bottom of this snafu and fix it quick ... before her fiance finds out and everything she's been working toward goes up in flames.	360	July 1st 2013	Andrea "Andie" Marks, Gavin "Mack" MacKenzie	Baker City, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25943219-shine-not-burn
