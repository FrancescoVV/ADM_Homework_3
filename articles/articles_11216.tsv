Yu Yu Hakusho #1	Yoshihiro Togashi	4.31	16202	139	Yusuke Urameshi was a tough teen delinquent until one selfless act changed his life... by ending it. When he died saving a little kid from a speeding car, the afterlife didn't know what to do with him, so it gave him a second chance at life. Now, Yusuke is a ghost with a mission, performing good deeds at the behest of Botan, the spirit guide of the dead, and Koenma, her pacifier-sucking boss from the "other side." But what strange things await him on the borderline between life and death?	208	1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/432020.Yu_Yu_Hakusho_Volume_1
