Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion		Jia Tolentino	4.18	34809	4027	Trick Mirror is an enlightening, unforgettable trip through the river of self-delusion that surges just beneath the surface of our lives. This is a book about the incentives that shape us, and about how hard it is to see ourselves clearly in a culture that revolves around the self. In each essay, Jia writes about the cultural prisms that have shaped her: the rise of the nightmare social internet; the American scammer as millennial hero; the literary heroineâ€™s journey from brave to blank to bitter; the mandate that everything, including our bodies, should always be getting more efficient and beautiful until we die.	303	August 6th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror
