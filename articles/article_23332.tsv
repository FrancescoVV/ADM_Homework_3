Blessings		Belva Plain	3.91	2730	52	At thirty-six Jennie Rakowsky's dreams were coming true. She was about to marry a wonderful man, her career as a lawyer was skyrocketing, and she had never been more beautiful. Then the secret she had hidden for nineteen years threatened to shatter it all. From growing up as a child of impoverished Holocaust survivors to discovering the glittering exclusive world of America's Jewish aristocracy, Jennie had learned how important family and heritage could be. Now she had to discover the values that went deeper still ... and the ties that entwine the heart with the richest love of all.	393	July 1st 1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16739.Blessings
