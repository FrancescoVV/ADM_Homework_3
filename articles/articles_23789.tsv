Thoughts Deeply Rooted Within Me: All I Can Do Is Stand		Aleja Bennett	5.00	2	0	This book goes into real life relationships and incidents in the writers life. The beautiful poems go from love, romance, break ups to make ups, family, feelings and the inner thoughts of a passionate, loving woman. If it was not for paper and pen the Author really does not know how she would have released all the years of brokenness she felt. Looking for love and trusting that love won't let you down all to feel it happen again and again. This book touched different relative topics that all young, middle aged and older adults can relate to.	158	December 3rd 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10285307-thoughts-deeply-rooted-within-me
