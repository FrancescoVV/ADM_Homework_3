Ring	Ring #1	Kōji Suzuki, Robert B. Rohmer, Glynne Walley	3.82	14940	1230	A mysterious videotape warns that the viewer will die in one week unless a certain, unspecified act is performed. Exactly one week after watching the tape, four teenagers die one after another of heart failure. Asakawa, a hardworking journalist, is intrigued by his niece's inexplicable death. His investigation leads him from a metropolitan tokyo teeming with modern society's fears to a rural Japan--a mountain resort, a volcanic island, and a countryside clinic--haunted by the past. His attempt to solve the tape's mystery before it's too late--for everyone--assumes an increasingly deadly urgency. Ring is a chillingly told horror story, a masterfully suspenseful mystery, and post-modern trip.	283	1991		Yokohama (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Yokosuka (Japan), Hakone , 1990 (Japan) Izu Ōshima , 1990 (Japan) Atami , 1990 (Japan), Hakone (Japan), Izu Ōshima (Japan), Atami (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38379.Ring
