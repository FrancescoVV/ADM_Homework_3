How To Talk To A Widower		Jonathan Tropper	3.98	14215	1468	Doug Parker is a widower at age twenty-nine, and in his quiet suburban town, that makes him something of a celebrityâ€”the object of sympathy, curiosity, and, in some cases, unbridled desire. But Doug has other things on his mind. First there's his sixteen year-old stepson, Russ: a once-sweet kid who now is getting into increasingly serious trouble on a daily basis. Then there are Doug's sisters: his bossy twin, Clair, who's just left he husband and moved in with Doug, determined to rouse him from his Grieving stupor. And Debbie, who's engaged to Doug's ex-best friend and manically determined to pull off the perfect wedding at any cost. Soon Doug's entire nuclear family is in his face. And when he starts dipping his toes into the shark-infested waters of the second-time around dating scene, it isn't long before his new life is spinning hopelessly out of control, cutting a harrowing and often hilarious swath of sexual missteps and escalating chaos across the suburban landscape.	352	April 26th 2007	Dough Parker		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242157.How_to_Talk_to_a_Widower
