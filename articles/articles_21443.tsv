Prince of Darkness	Arc of Radiance/Fall of Radiance #5	Blake Arthur Peel	4.37	102	12	The end has come at last. With the Arc of Radiance gone, Asmodeus, the Prince of Darkness, marches on Tarsynium with an inumerable demon host at his back. It would seem that the end of the world has finally come. A slim hope remains as our heroes ride forth, determined to cast an ancient spell that has not been used in centuries. Their success hinges on their ability to hold back the R'Laar long enough for them to try their desperate plan. Their failure means extinction for all humankind... The thrilling conclusion to the epic Arc of Radiance saga!		July 7th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53710806-prince-of-darkness
