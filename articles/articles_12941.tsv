The Inheritors		William Golding	3.53	3727	384	When the spring came the people - what was left of them - moved back by the old paths from the sea. But this year strange things were happening, terrifying things that had never happened before. Inexplicable sounds and smells; new, unimaginable creatures half glimpsed through the leaves. What the people didn't, and perhaps never would, know, was that the day of their people was already over. From the author of Lord of the Flies , The Inheritors is a startling recreation of the lost world of the Neanderthals, and a frightening vision of the beginning of a new age.	240	1955			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14428.The_Inheritors
