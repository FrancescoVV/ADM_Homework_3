House Rules	Chicagoland Vampires #7	Chloe Neill	4.18	18098	1032	In a city full of vampires, trouble never sleeps. At the tender age of twenty-seven, Merit became a sword-wielding vampire. Since then, she’s become the protector of her House, watched Chicago nearly burn to the ground, and seen her Master fall and rise. Now she’ll see her mettle—and her metal—tested like never before. It started with two . . . Two rogues vanishing without a trace. Someone is targeting Chicago’s vampires, and anyone could be next. With their house in peril, Merit and her Master, the centuries-old Ethan Sullivan, must race to stop the disappearances. But as they untangle a web of secret alliances and ancient evils, they realize their foe is more familiar, and more powerful, than they could have ever imagined.	352	February 5th 2013	Caroline "Merit" Merit, Ethan Sullivan, Mallory Carmichael, Catcher Bell, Jeff Christopher		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12958034-house-rules
