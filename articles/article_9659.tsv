The Family Moskat		Isaac Bashevis Singer	4.20	1351	111	The vanished way of life of Eastern European Jews in the early part of the twentieth century is the subject of this extraordinary novel. All the strata of this complex society were populated by powerfully individual personalities, and the whole community pulsated with life and vitality. The affairs of the patriarchal Meshulam Moskat and the unworldly Asa Heshel Bannet provide the center of the book, but its real focus is the civilization that was destroyed forever in the gas chambers of the Second World War.		1950	Meshulam Moskat	Warsaw (Poland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/718666.The_Family_Moskat
