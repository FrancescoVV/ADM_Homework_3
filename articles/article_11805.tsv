Effortless	Breathless #3	Lynn Montagano	4.13	88	13	The breathtaking conclusion to Lia and Alastair’s relationship… is love alone enough to keep them together? Perfect for fans of 50 Shades & Sylvia Day. Everything in Lia Meyers’ life seems perfect. She’s made the move ‘across the pond’ to start a new life with the man of her dreams and is impressing her new bosses as the executive producer of a popular news magazine program. Alastair Holden, the enigmatic Englishman who has Lia’s heart, puts her above all else, even at the expense of his billion-dollar worldwide media empire. Lia couldn’t be luckier, right? But her lavish world of hearts and flowers soon turns upside down. Living under the white hot spotlight of the Holden family empire proves to be more complicated than she anticipated. She doesn’t know who to trust and questions the motives of her closest friends. To make matters worse, Alastair begins to revert back to his closed off ways. When a life changing event thrusts him into chaos, Lia must decide if a diamond really is forever or if she should learn to cut her losses.
