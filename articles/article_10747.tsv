A Time to Tell		Maria Savva	3.85	67	29	Set between the 1950s and the start of the 21st Century, "A Time to Tell" is the poignant story of Cara, from her dramatic attempted suicide to her roles as a smitten eighteen-year-old, wife, widow and grandmother, and her final, passionate reunion with the man she has always loved. It is also the parallel tale of Cara's prodigal son Benjamin and his daughter Penelope, whose unhappy relationship with her father has led her into marriage with a man whose own dysfunctional family have turned him into a person who at first seems strangely attractive, but turns out to have a dark and terrifying side... Rich in colourful characters and pertinent social themes, "A Time to Tell" is an eventful and often disturbing tale of the pain and pleasures of family relationships.	304	December 13th 2006	Cara Edwards, Penelope Truman, Benjamin Edwards, Frederick Johnson, David Truman	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3359011-a-time-to-tell
