The Breach	Travis Chase #1	Patrick  Lee	4.02	7946	695	“Audacious and terrifying—and uncannily believable.” —Lee Child New York Times bestselling author of the Jack Reacher series, Lee Child, was blown away by The Breach —and you will be, too! A novel of unrelenting suspense and nonstop surprises, The Breach immediately rockets author Patrick Lee into the V.I.P. section of the thriller universe. A treat for Jack Bauer (“24”) fans and “X-Files” aficionados, it is a white-knuckle roller-coaster ride that combines the best of Dean Koontz and Michael Crichton with a healthy dollop of Indiana Jones thrown into the mix—the perfect secret agent/government conspiracy/supernatural adventure.	372	December 10th 2009		Wyoming (United States), Alaska (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6987527-the-breach
