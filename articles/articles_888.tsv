The Iliad		Homer, Robert Fagles, Bernard Knox	3.87	354019	7324	Dating to the ninth century B.C., Homer’s timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to the wrenching, tragic conclusion of the Trojan War. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”	683	-750	Ajax (Greek hero), Odysseus, Helen of Troy, Menelaus, Paris, Hector of Troy, Achilles (Greek hero), Aeneas, Sarpedon (king of Lycia), Priam, Cassandra (of Troy), Patroclus, Diomedes, Ajax Oileus, Andromache, Briseis, Hecuba, Nestor, Akhilleus, Agamemnon	Troy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1371.The_Iliad
