Atlantis Unmasked	Warriors Of Poseidon #4	Alyssa Day	4.23	3973	130	A warrior scarred... A descendant of Diana... When two worlds collide... Atlantis is unmasked. Alexios survived two years of unspeakable torture at the hands of a vampire goddess. Now he's been ordered to team up with a beautiful warrior and take on the most dangerous mission of his life: to retrieve the Vampire's Bane. Without it, Atlantis can't ascend to the surface and take its rightful place in the world. But when evil threatens, will Alexios be led by duty-or his heart? Grace is part of the rebellion against the vampires and shape-shifters trying to take over her world. She is deadly with her bow, because when she takes aim, she never misses her target. But suddenly she's focused on a damaged Atlantean warrior who sees her as a weapon, not as a woman. When thousands of lives are on the line, will passion overrule, or will her aim be true?	298	July 7th 2009	Alexios, Grace Havilland	Florida (United States), Atlantis	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5519759-atlantis-unmasked
