Lord of the Shadows	Cirque du Freak #11	Darren Shan	4.22	20068	422	Book 11 of The Saga Of Darren Shan. Darren's going home. Back to where everything started. The town's changed a lot in the years that he's been away -- but then, so has Darren. Plagued by nightmares of what the future seems to hold, Darren feels uneasy revisiting the place where he was re-born as a child of the night, as though the universe (as though destiny) is plotting to throw something very nasty at him on the streets of his old home.	220	January 1st 2005	Darren Shan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8949.Lord_of_the_Shadows
