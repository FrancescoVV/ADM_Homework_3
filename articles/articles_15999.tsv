The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl	The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl #1	Barry Lyga	3.63	6549	847	Fanboy has never had it good, but lately his sophomore year is turning out to be its own special hell. The bullies have made him their favorite target, his best (and only) friend seems headed for the dark side (sports and popularity), and his pregnant mother and the step-fascist are eagerly awaiting the birth of the alien life form known as Fanboy’s new little brother or sister. Fanboy, though, has a secret: a graphic novel he’s been working on without telling anyone, a graphic novel that he is convinced will lead to publication, fame, and—most important of all—a way out of the crappy little town he lives in and all the people that make it hell for him. When Fanboy meets Kyra, a.k.a. Goth Girl, he finds an outrageous, cynical girl who shares his love of comics as well as his hatred for jocks and bullies. Fanboy can’t resist someone who actually seems to understand him, and soon he finds himself willing to heed her advice—to ignore or crush anyone who stands in his way.	311	September 6th 2006	Kyra Sellers, Fanboy	Maryland (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257445.The_Astonishing_Adventures_of_Fanboy_and_Goth_Girl
