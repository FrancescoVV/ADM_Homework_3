Mortal Causes	Inspector Rebus #6	Ian Rankin	3.96	10121	386	Underneath the cobbled streets of Edinburgh's old Town are medieval stone cellars where a man could scream and never be heard. In mortal Causes, the tortured body of a young man is found hanging from a butcher's hook in one of these underground rooms. The tattoo on his wrist and a cryptic inscription scratched in the dirt suggest to Inspector John Rebus that this was an execution, but what man or men carried it out?	278	1994	Inspector John Rebus	Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/511993.Mortal_Causes
