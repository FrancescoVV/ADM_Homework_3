The White Plague		Frank Herbert	3.70	5812	321	The White Plague, a marvelous and terrifyingly plausible blend of fiction and visionary theme, tells of one man who is pushed over the edge of sanity by the senseless murder of his family and who, reappearing several months later as the so-called Madman, unleashes a terrible plague upon the human raceâ€”one that zeros in, unerringly and fatally, on women.	502	August 21st 1982	John Roe O'Neill		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93448.The_White_Plague
