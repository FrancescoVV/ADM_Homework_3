The Same Old Story		Ivan Goncharov, Ivy Litvinov	4.18	1247	86	The Same Old Story (1847) tells the story of Alexander Aduyev who leaves the idyllic setting of his home in the country to seek his fortune and make a career in St. Petersburg under the guidance and protection of his uncle, a government official. Such is the beginning of this "ordinary story". Alexander Aduyev, a "romantic three times over" (to quote Vissarion Belinsky) gradually sheds his idyllic notions and develops into a heartless and calculating climber.	392	1847		Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123667.The_Same_Old_Story
