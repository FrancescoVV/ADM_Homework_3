The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse & Betrayal		Nick Bryant	4.15	305	31	A chilling expos√© of corporate corruption and government cover-ups, this account of a nationwide child-trafficking and pedophilia ring in the United States tells a sordid tale of corruption in high places. The scandal originally surfaced during an investigation into Omaha, Nebraska's failed Franklin Federal Credit Union and took the author beyond the Midwest and ultimately to Washington, DC. Implicating businessmen, senators, major media corporations, the CIA, and even the venerable Boys Town organization, this extensively researched report includes firsthand interviews with key witnesses and explores a controversy that has received scant media attention.	672	January 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/726441.The_Franklin_Scandal
