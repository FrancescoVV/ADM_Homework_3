Fool Moon	The Dresden Files #2	Jim Butcher	4.01	163717	7259	Harry Dresden--Wizard Lost Items Found. Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment. Business has been slow. Okay, business has been dead. And not even of the undead variety. You would think Chicago would have a little more action for the only professional wizard in the phone book. But lately, Harry Dresden hasn't been able to dredge up any kind of work--magical or mundane. But just when it looks like he can't afford his next meal, a murder comes along that requires his particular brand of supernatural expertise. A brutally mutilated corpse. Strange-looking paw prints. A full moon. Take three guesses--and the first two don't count...	401	January 1st 2001	Susan Rodriguez, Bob (Dresden Files), "Gentleman" John Marcone, Karrin Murphy, Harry Dresden, Georgia Borden, Billy Borden	Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91477.Fool_Moon
