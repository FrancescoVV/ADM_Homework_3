Dash & Lily's Book of Dares	Dash & Lily #1	Rachel Cohn, David Levithan	3.78	73337	7708	“I’ve left some clues for you. If you want them, turn the page. If you don’t, put the book back on the shelf, please.” So begins the latest whirlwind romance from the bestselling authors of Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist . Lily has left a red notebook full of challenges on a favorite bookstore shelf, waiting for just the right guy to come along and accept its dares. But is Dash that right guy? Or are Dash and Lily only destined to trade dares, dreams, and desires in the notebook they pass back and forth at locations across New York? Could their in-person selves possibly connect as well as their notebook versions? Or will they be a comic mismatch of disastrous proportions? Rachel Cohn and David Levithan have written a love story that will have readers perusing bookstore shelves, looking and longing for a love (and a red notebook) of their own.	260	October 26th 2010	Boomer, Dashiell (Dash), Langston, Sofia, Lily	Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States), New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7741325-dash-lily-s-book-of-dares
