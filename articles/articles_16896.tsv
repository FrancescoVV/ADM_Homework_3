Sweet Release		Carrie Pulkinen	3.88	41	17	The day Miranda Billings dies isn't the worst day of her life—but it's close. Miranda is a nurse who's stuck in a passionless relationship and a dull life. The only excitement she has to look forward to is the hot EMT who flirts with her every day. She dreams of adventure and escaping her boring existence, but she has to lose everything—including her life—to find the exhilaration she craves. When Andre, the half-demon EMT, finds the woman he loves crushed by a bus, he reawakens her soul with his magic and his blood. Now, Andre must decide if he’s willing to let her join him in his perilous quest to slay demons and save humans. He almost lost her once. Is he willing to risk losing her forever?
