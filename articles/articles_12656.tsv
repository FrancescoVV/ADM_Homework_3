One rainy day, Ichigo, whose ability top see the undead is a blessing and curse, tried to stop young girl from drowning in a nearby river. His mother, Masaki, ran after them, frantically trying to rescue her only son. Then everything went black, and Ichigo awoke only to discover his mother dead and the little girl gone. It's the anniversary of Masaki's death, and the entire Kurosaki clan, along with former Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki, head to the cemetary to pay their respects. Sleeping demons rarely ever stay still and pretty soon Ichigo confronts the Grand Fisher, the Hollow that may be responsible for his mother's demise.	192	June 4th 2002	Ichigo Kurosaki, Orihime Inoue, Rukia Kuchiki, Isshin Kurosaki, Kon, Tatsuki Arisawa, Mizuiro Kojima, Grand Fisher, Karin Kurosaki, Yuzu Kurosaki, Masaki Kurosaki		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/271264.Bleach_Volume_03
