Texture Techniques for Winning Watercolors		Ray Hendershot	4.28	43	1	Ray Hendershot shows artists how to have fun and use inventive texture techniques to turn acceptable watercolor paintings into outstanding ones. Dozens of hands-on exercises and step-by-step demonstrations show exciting ways to suggest detail (such as trees, bricks and crockery) and set the mood in paintings. A self-taught watercolorist, Hendershot developed his techniques through trial and error, uninhibited by the 'accepted rules' of the medium. In addition to traditional texture techniques such as spattering and spritzing, this book includes more unconventional 'tricks' using special brushes and other media.	128	September 1st 1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4952870-texture-techniques-for-winning-watercolors
