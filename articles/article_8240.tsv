Goodbye to Berlin	The Berlin Novels  #2	Christopher Isherwood	3.95	9906	752	Here, meine Damen und Herren, is Chrisopther Isherwood's brilliant farewell to a city which was not only buildings, streets, and people, but was also a state of mind which will never come around again. In linked short stories, he says goodbye to Sally Bowles, to Fraulein Schroeder, to pranksters, perverts, political manipulators; to the very, very guilty and to the dwindling band of innocents. It is goodbye to a Berlin wild, wicked, breathtaking, decadent beyond belief and already - in the years between the wars - welcoming death in through the door, though more with a wink than a whimper. ~from the back cover	208	1939		Berlin (Germany), RÃ¼gen (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/760702.Goodbye_to_Berlin
