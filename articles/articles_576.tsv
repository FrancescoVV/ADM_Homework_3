The Merchant of Venice		William Shakespeare, Robert          Jackson, Barbara A. Mowat, Paul Werstine	3.80	158333	3781	In this lively comedy of love and money in sixteenth-century Venice, Bassanio wants to impress the wealthy heiress Portia but lacks the necessary funds. He turns to his merchant friend, Antonio, who is forced to borrow from Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. When Antonio's business falters, repayment becomes impossible--and by the terms of the loan agreement, Shylock is able to demand a pound of Antonio's flesh. Portia cleverly intervenes, and all ends well (except of course for Shylock).	337	1596		Republic of Venice, Venice (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24128.The_Merchant_of_Venice
