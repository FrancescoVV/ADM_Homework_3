Pender #2	Jonathan Nasaw	3.92	995	56	From Jonathan Nasaw, whose heart-stopping debut was hailed as "a superior thriller" ("The Washington Post") and "wickedly compelling" ("The Oregonian"), comes a new novel that takes readers into the depths of"Fear Itself" Is it possible to be scared to death? FBI Special Agent E. L. Pender thinks so -- when a man afraid of heights falls nineteen stories to his death and a woman terrified of blood is found with her wrists slashed. Could it be that the apparent suicides are actually the work of a twisted psychopath? To stop him, Pender joins forces with Investigative Specialist Linda Abruzzi, and before long they find themselves facing their own worst terrors -- and a madman who is as immune to fear as he is fascinated by it.	470	December 31st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1024724.Fear_Itself
