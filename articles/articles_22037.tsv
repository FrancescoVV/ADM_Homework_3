The Voice of the Night		Dean Koontz	3.94	17435	417	No one could understand why Colin and Roy were best friends. Colin was so shy; Roy was so popular. Colin was nervous around girls; Roy was a ladies’ man. Colin was fascinated by Roy — and Roy was fascinated with death. Then one day Roy asked his timid friend, “You ever killed anything?” And from that moment on, the two were bound together in a game too terrifying to imagine… and too irresistible to stop. Includes an afterword by the author.	339	1980		California (United States), Santa Leona, California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64949.The_Voice_of_the_Night
