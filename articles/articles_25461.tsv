The World According to Clarkson	The World According to Clarkson #1	Jeremy Clarkson	3.69	5491	295	Jeremy Clarkson shares his opinions on just about everything in The World According to Clarkson. Jeremy Clarkson has seen rather more of the world than most. He has, as they say, been around a bit. And as a result, he's got one or two things to tell us about how it all works; and being Jeremy Clarkson he's not about to voice them quietly, humbly and without great dollops of humour. In The World According to Clarkson , he reveals why it is that: Too much science is bad for our health '70s rock music is nothing to be ashamed of Hunting foxes while drunk and wearing night-sights is neither big nor clever We must work harder to get rid of cricket He likes the Germans (well, sometimes) With a strong dose of common sense that is rarely, if ever, found inside the M25, Clarkson hilariously attacks the pompous, the ridiculous, the absurd and the downright idiotic, whilst also celebrating the eccentric, the clever and the sheer bloody brilliant. Less a manifesto for living and more a road map to modern life, The World According to Clarkson is the funniest book you'll read this year. Don't leave home without it.	327	2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/300118.The_World_According_to_Clarkson
