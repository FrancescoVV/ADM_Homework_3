The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future (Updated With a New Epilogue)		Riane Eisler	4.14	3090	264	The legacy of the sacred feminine. The Chalice and the Blade tells a new story of our cultural origins. It shows that warfare and the war of the sexes are neither divinely nor biologically ordained. It provides verification that a better future is possibleâ€”and is in fact firmly rooted in the haunting dramas of what happened in our past.	304	1987			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/470367.The_Chalice_and_the_Blade
