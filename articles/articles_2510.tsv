Jessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark Side	Jessica #1	Beth Fantaskey	3.84	39995	2950	The undead can really screw up your senior year ... Marrying a vampire definitely doesn’t fit into Jessica Packwood’s senior year “get-a-life” plan. But then a bizarre (and incredibly hot) new exchange student named Lucius Vladescu shows up, claiming that Jessica is a Romanian vampire princess by birth—and he’s her long-lost fiancé. Armed with newfound confidence and a copy of Growing Up Undead: A Teen Vampire’s Guide to Dating, Health, and Emotions, Jessica makes a dramatic transition from average American teenager to glam European vampire princess. But when a devious cheerleader sets her sights on Lucius, Jess finds herself fighting to win back her wayward prince, stop a global vampire war—and save Lucius’s soul from eternal destruction.	351	October 19th 2000	Lucius Vladescu, (Anatasia) Jessica Packwood		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3389671-jessica-s-guide-to-dating-on-the-dark-side
