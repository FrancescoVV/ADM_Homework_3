Athena the Brain	Goddess Girls #1	Joan Holub, Suzanne Williams	4.08	6956	563	Athena has always been above average. She has never quite fit in at Triton Junior High, but who would've guessed that Athena is actually a goddess? Principal Zeus's daughter, to be exact. When she's summoned to Mount Olympus Academy, Athena thinks she might actually fit in for the first time in her life. But in some ways, school on Mount Olympus is not that different from down on Earth, and Athena is going to have to deal with the baddest mean girl in history: Medusa!	160	January 1st 2010	Athena (Greek goddess)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6788767-athena-the-brain
