God Went to Beauty School		Cynthia Rylant	3.96	967	198	A deeply compelling collection of poems about God and our everyday world from a Newbery medalist. Cynthia Rylant takes teens on an invigorating spiritual journey as she explores what God's life on Earth might be like. Rylant's reflective and often humorous verse follows God as he tries out human activities such as getting a dog, writing a fan letter, and making spaghetti. God Went to Beauty School combines the awesome with the everyday in an accessible, thought-provoking, and intelligent manner.	56	2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332021.God_Went_to_Beauty_School
