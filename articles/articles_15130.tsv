Multiple Bles8ings: Surviving to Thriving with Twins and Sextuplets		Jon Gosselin, Kate Gosselin, Beth Carson	3.32	3898	690	Eight children in three years? Impossible! Kate and Jon Gosselin have learned that, through God, all things are possible--though sometimes slightly improbable. Just three years after giving birth to twin daughters, Kate and Jon learned they were pregnant again--with sextuplets. In Multiple Blessings, Kate candidly chronicles the emotional and exhausting challenges she and Jon faced from the time the babies were conceived through the first two years of their lives. This amazing story of faith provides a heartening lesson in what it means to trust the faithful hand of God to provide the strength and courage to make it through life's seemingly impossible situations.	208	September 19th 2008	Joel Cooper, Hannah Fear, Cara, Leah Cornick, Jon, Kate Dawson, Mady, Alexis, Collin, Aaden		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3129678-multiple-bles8ings
