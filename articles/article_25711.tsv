Nightmare Movies: A Critical Guide to Contemporary Horror Films		Kim Newman	4.18	224	8	In 1968, George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby brought a new slant to the horror film, bringing zombies and witchcraft into a contemporary setting, and much closer to home than the cardboard Transylvanias of earlier films. This work is a critical overview of the horror movie genre from the late 1960s with a discussion of over 2000 films - masterpiece and monstrosity alike.	255	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/280021.Nightmare_Movies
