Princess in the Spotlight	The Princess Diaries #2	Meg Cabot	3.69	54455	1711	No one ever said being a princess was easy. Just when Mia thought she had the whole princess thing under control, things get out of hand, fast. First, there's an unexpected announcement from her mother. Then Grandmère arranges a national primetime interview for the brand-new crown princess of Genovia. On top of that, intriguing, exasperating letters from a secret admirer begin to arrive. Before she even has the chance to wonder who those letters are from, Mia is swept up in a whirlwind of royal intrigue the likes of which haven't been seen since volume I of The Princess Diaries.	257	June 26th 2001	Mia Thermopolis, Lilly Moscovitz, Helen Thermopolis, Frank Gianini, Michael Moscovitz, "Grandmère" Clarisse Renaldo	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/439275.Princess_in_the_Spotlight
