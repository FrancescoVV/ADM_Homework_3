Bones and Roses	Cypress Bay #1	Eileen Goudge	3.65	516	84	New York Times bestselling author Eileen Goudge presents Bones and Roses , the first book in her exciting new Cypress Bay Mysteries series! Welcome to the northern California seaside town of Cypress Bay, where the surf's up, the sixties live on and long-buried secrets are about to surface. From home invasions to cheating spouses, Rest Easy Property Management owner Leticia "Tish" Ballard thought she'd seen it all. Almost four years sober after flamb√©ing her real estate career in an alcohol-fueled blowout, she's finally in a good place in her life when the discovery of skeletal human remains rocks her world and plunges her headlong into solving a decades-old crime. Now she must delve into the darkness of her own past, including the one-night stand gone horribly wrong with Spence Breedlove, who happens to be the lead detective on the case. When the truth comes out at long last, Tish finds herself pitted against an enemy who will stop at nothing in a fight for her own life.	231	August 5th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22741361-bones-and-roses
