Thirst No. 2: Phantom, Evil Thirst, and Creatures of Forever	The Last Vampire #4-6	Christopher Pike	4.07	29087	661	Includes: Phantom Evil Thirst Creatures of Forever Tears roll over my face. I touch them with my quivering tongue. They are clear and salty, not dark and bloody. Another sign that I am human. What Alisa has desired for five thousand years has finally come true: She is once again human. But now she is defenseless, vulnerable, and, for the first time in centuries, emotional. As she attempts to reconcile her actions as a vampire with her new connection to humanity, she begins to understand the weight of life-and-death decisions. Can Alisa resolve her past and build a new identity, or is she doomed to repeat her fatal mistakes?	581	January 5th 2010	Sita, Seymour Dorsten, Ray Riley		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6424184-thirst-no-2
