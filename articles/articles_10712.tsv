Maya of the Inbetween		Sita Bennett	4.86	91	13	Dystopia, Utopia, and the realm of Gỗds intersect through the inter-dimensional Sëeing's of one girl, Maya; The Inbetween. Humanity's channel between life and death. Humanity has depleted planet Earth of its natural resources, and natural disasters have been steadily wiping the land clean in a last-resort attempt to restore balance and survive. All remaining life is contained in one City. A City of iron and technology where the citizens are safe but they are not free. Until recently, MAYA lived there in hiding, painting visions of a vibrant valley where nature still thrives. She's a Sëer, a Mystic, a Feeler... and a Rebel. Life imitates art when she sees the man she paints—a young, bright-eyed German officer, BJÖRN—who tells her the world she's been painting is real, and he's determined to find it. In a race against the Control and a quest for truth and freedom, they escape the City and cross dimensions to seek the help of a sophisticated race of beings—keepers of the Earth's sacred mysteries—to save it from total self-destruction.	326	June 14th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52862903-maya-of-the-inbetween
