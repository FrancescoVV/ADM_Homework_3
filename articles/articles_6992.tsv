The Goddess Legacy	Goddess Test #2.5	Aimee Carter	4.04	7505	595	For millennia we've caught only glimpses of the lives and loves of the gods and goddesses on Olympus. Now Aim√©e Carter pulls back the curtain on how they became the powerful, petty, loving and dangerous immortals that Kate Winters knows. Calliope/Hera represented constancy and yet had a husband who never matched her faithfulness.... Ava/Aphrodite was the goddess of love and yet commitment was a totally different deal.... Persephone was urged to marry one man, yet longed for another.... James/Hermes loved to make trouble for others - but never knew true loss before.... Henry/Hades's solitary existence had grown too wearisome to continue. But meeting Kate Winters gave him a new hope.... Five original novellas of love, loss and longing and the will to survive throughout the ages.
