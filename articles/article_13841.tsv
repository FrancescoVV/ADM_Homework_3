On Stranger Tides		Tim Powers	3.85	7907	785	Aboard the Vociferous Carmichael, puppeteer John Chandagnac is sailing toward Jamaica to claim his stolen birthright from an unscrupulous uncle, when the vessel is captured . . . by pirates! Offered a choice by Captain Phil Davies to join their seafaring band or die, Chandagnac assumes the name John Shandy and a new life as a brigand. But more than swashbuckling sea battles and fabulous plunder await the novice buccaneer on the roiling Caribbean watersâ€“for treachery and powerful vodun sorcery are coins of the realm in this dark new world. And for the love of beautiful, magically imperiled Beth Hurwood, Shandy will set sail on even stranger tides, following the savage, ghost-infested pirate king, Blackbeard, and a motley crew of the living and the dead to the cursed nightmare banks of the fabled Fountain of Youth.	370	November 1987	John Chandagnac, Beth Hurwood, Benjamin Hurwood, Stede Bonnet, Blackbeard	Caribbean Sea, Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15670.On_Stranger_Tides
