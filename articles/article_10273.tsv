Rock Springs		Richard Ford	4.07	4813	261	In these ten stories, Ford mines literary gold from the wind-scrubbed landscape of the American West--and from the guarded hopes and gnawing loneliness of the people who live there. Rock Springs is a masterpiece of taut narration, cleanly chiseled prose, and empathy so generous that it feels like a kind of grace.	245	1987			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26936.Rock_Springs
