The Way We Were Before		Madi Lalor	4.14	21	5	"He isn't the same guy that you grew up with, alright? Don't forget that." ------- Luna and Easton were the best of friends once. But even then things changed. Luna hasn't seen Easton in five years, not since her parents funeral when he wouldn't hold her hand. The last shred of closure that Luna needs is to understand why Easton suddenly cut her out of his life for good. But she's come to terms with the fact that she will never see him again. Until she receives an invitation to Easton's eighteenth birthday. And for Luna, life itself will never be the same again.	350	December 16th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52839533-the-way-we-were-before
