Shadowland	The Mediator #1	Meg Cabot, Jenny Carroll	4.03	63701	2468	Suze is a mediator -- a liaison between the living and the dead. In other words, she sees dead people. And they won't leave her alone until she helps them resolve their unfinished business with the living. But Jesse, the hot ghost haunting her bedroom, doesn't seem to need her help. Which is a relief, because Suze has just moved to sunny California and plans to start fresh, with trips to the mall instead of the cemetery, and surfing instead of spectral visitations. But the very first day at her new school, Suze realizes it's not that easy. There's a ghost with revenge on her mind ... and Suze happens to be in the way.	287	November 1st 2000	Susannah "Suze" Simon, Hector de Silva (Jesse), Father Dominic, Andy Ackerman, Jake Ackerman (Sleepy), Brad Ackerman (Dopey), David Ackerman (Doc), Adam McTavish, CeeCee Webb, Bryce Martinson, Gina Augustin	Carmel-by-the-Sea, California (United States), California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187811.Shadowland
