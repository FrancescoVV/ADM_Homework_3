Hide and Seek	Inspector Rebus #2	Ian Rankin	3.83	16677	753	A junkie lies dead in an Edinburgh squat. Just another dead addict, until John Rebus begins to chip away at the indifference, treachery, deceit and sleaze that lurk beneath the facade of the Edinburgh familiar to tourists. Only Rebus seems to care about a death which looks more like murder every day, about a seductive danger he can almost taste, appealing to the darkest corners of his mind.	224	1990	Inspector John Rebus	Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77490.Hide_and_Seek
