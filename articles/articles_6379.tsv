Julie of the Wolves	Julie of the Wolves #1	Jean Craighead George, John Schoenherr	3.81	55044	1747	Alone and lost—on the North Slope of Alaska Miyax rebels against a home situation she finds intolerable. She runs away toward San Francisco, toward her pen pal, who calls her Julie. But soon Miyax is lost in the Alaskan wilderness, without food, without even a compass. Slowly she is accepted by a pack of Arctic wolves, and she comes to love them as though they were her brothers. With their help, and drawing on her father’s training, she struggles day by day to survive. In the process, she is forced to rethink her past, and to define for herself the traditional riches of Eskimo life: intelligence, fearlessness, and love.	176	1972	Miyax, Amaroq, Kapugen	Alaska (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386286.Julie_of_the_Wolves
