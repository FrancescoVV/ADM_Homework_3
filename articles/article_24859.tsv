Off the Record	Off The Record #1.0	Matthew Haldeman-Time	3.77	139	18	Witty, romantic, and satisfyingly steamy, this novel is for any fan of gay erotica looking for a solid love story. Because of his infamous birth (and famous parentage), Jordan Jennings' every move made the headlines, and he soon learned that the only way to keep the media out of his life was not to have a life at all. Charged with keeping his family's secrets, as well as his own, he put aside his own desires for the sake of family pride. With the chance of love on the horizon, will Jordan have to sacrifice his family's reputation in order to have a life of his own? Patrick Wright was a fearless reporter headed straight to the top. He was a man who knew what he wanted and always went after it. With money, success, and a very healthy social life, Patrick had no idea that anything was missing until he met Jordan, someone he suddenly couldnâ€™t do without. But when careers hang in the balance and Patrick is faced with losing everything he's worked so hard to achieve, will his love for Jordan conquer all?	181	2005	Jordan Jennings, Patrick Wright (Off the Record)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1480335.Off_the_Record
