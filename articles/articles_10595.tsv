The Seven - The Key of Credence		Veronica Mist	4.76	33	15	First of five books. The Key of Credence tells us about Ryan and her friends and how their simple curiosity brought forth a multitude of problems to them. This book lets the readers experience an entirely new and different world—one that involves the Heavens and the Helles, and most of all—it shows how the humans themselves and how the innate goodness of their souls can create a huge difference on just about everything.	262	October 7th 2011		Sanctae Mundus	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12889647-the-seven---the-key-of-credence
