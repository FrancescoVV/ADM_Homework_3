Young Lonigan	Studs Lonigan #1	James T. Farrell, Pete Hamill	3.47	1107	45	It's a story about coming-of-age and sexual awakening in the mean streets of 1910s Chicago. It's the beginning of a trilogy that will follow Studs Lonigan throughout adolescence. And, claims Arthur Schlesinger, Jr, it reveals "his vision of the truth-the truth about people, the truth about writing, the truth about America."	224	January 1st 1932			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169810.Young_Lonigan
