The Golden Notebook		Doris Lessing	3.76	19486	1707	Anna is a writer, author of one very successful novel, who now keeps four notebooks. In one, with a black cover, she reviews the African experience of her earlier year. In a red one she records her political life, her disillusionment with communism. In a yellow one she writes a novel in which the heroine relives part of her own experience. And in the blue one she keeps a personal diary. Finally, in love with an American writer and threatened with insanity, Anna tries to bring the threads of all four books together in a golden notebook.	640	1962	Anna Wulf, Max Wulf, Janet Wulf, Molly Jacobs, Richard Portmain		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24100.The_Golden_Notebook
