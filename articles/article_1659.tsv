In Salidar the White Tower in exile prepares an embassy to Caemlyn, where Rand Al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, holds the throne -- and where an unexpected visitor may change the world ... In Emond's Field, Perrin Goldeneyes, Lord of the Two Rivers, feels the pull of ta'veren to ta'veren and prepares to march ... Morgase of Caemlyn finds a most unexpected, and quite unwelcome, ally ... And south lies Illian, where Sammael holds sway ...	1011	October 15th 1994	Rand al'Thor, Nynaeve al'Meara, Egwene al'Vere, Perrin Aybara, Matrim Cauthon, Min Farshaw, Elayne Trakand, Aviendha, Siuan Sanche, Birgitte Silverbow		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35231.Lord_of_Chaos
