His Teddy Bear		Eve Langlais	3.79	2556	127	All he wants is his chubby Teddy bear. Chubby Teddy, who is ironically enough a bear shifter, has finally found her mate. There’s one big problem though. He doesn’t like what he sees. Reece never imagined his chosen mate would be a woman with extra curves, but all it takes is one taste to realize the benefits and turn his world upside down. Their arguments are many, their lust for each other fiery, but while he’s ready to for the next step, Teddy keeps running. What will it take to win her trust and heart? And an even better question; will they ever make it to a bed?	69	April 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29763637-his-teddy-bear
