Grumbles from the Grave		Robert A. Heinlein, Virginia Heinlein	3.59	2144	37	Long before his death in 1988, Robert A. Heinlein had expressed the desire to have a selection of his letters published, after he was gone, and entitled 'Grumbles from the Grave'. But increasing pressure from his work and a series of major illnesses made it impossible for him to undertake the job of editing this himself. Now his wife, Virginia Heinlein, has taken on the labor of fulfilling his wish.
