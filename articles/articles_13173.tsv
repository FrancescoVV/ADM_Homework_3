Her Innocent Marine		Arthur Archambeau	4.24	17	6	In the fall of 2004, Marine Corporal, Danny Shaunessey, is bound for the war in Iraq. Fearing that he could die in combat, he embarks on a mission to lose his virginity prior to deployment. Beth Kelly is an animal-loving veterinary technician looking for a gallant hero. The Marines are always looking for A Few Good Men. Beth’s only looking for one. A stray kitten brings them together. But after a few idyllic days together, war pulls them apart. Her Innocent Marine is an old-fashioned romance with a touch of eroticism. It’s also a gritty and graphic portrayal of the realities of war. War destroys both bodies and minds. Can it also destroy love?	117	November 9th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42645702-her-innocent-marine
