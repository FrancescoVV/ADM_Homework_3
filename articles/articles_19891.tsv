In between watching his TiVo, he manages to make and release Clerks II , relate the story of his partner-in-crime Jason Mewesâ€™ heroin addiction, get a tattoo, serve on a jury... and get caught stealing donuts from Burt Reynolds Thrown in are his views on the perils of strip clubs, the drawback of threesomes, the pain of anal fissures, his love-affair with Star Wars and so much more!
