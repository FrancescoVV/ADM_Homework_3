How to Use the Science of Mind: Principle in Practice		Ernest Shurtleff Holmes	4.38	120	3	Everything You Need to Know about How to Use One of Today's Most Powerful Philosophies! "We go in search of that which we already possess, but are not using." So says Ernest Holmes, author of THE SCIENCE OF MIND and founder of the philosophy of Religious Science. God is not far away, but is within ourselves, other people, and everywhere present. Why then, do we fall prey to unwanted conditions - illness, financial lack, relationship difficulties, loneliness and problems of every kind? Written as a manual for the practical applications of the principles set forth in The Science of Mind , this book takes the original philosophy of "change your thinking, change your life," and explains a clear and definite scientific method of prayer that can help you overcome life's obstacles.	120	December 1st 1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149198.How_to_Use_the_Science_of_Mind
