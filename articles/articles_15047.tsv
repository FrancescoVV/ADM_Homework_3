When Beauty Tamed the Beast	Fairy Tales #2	Eloisa James	4.06	23342	2037	Miss Linnet Berry Thrynne is a Beauty . . . Naturally, she's betrothed to a Beast. Piers Yelverton, Earl of Marchant, lives in a castle in Wales where, it is rumored, his bad temper flays everyone he crosses. And rumor also has it that a wound has left the earl immune to the charms of any woman. Linnet is not just any woman. She is more than merely lovely: her wit and charm brought a prince to his knees. She estimates the earl will fall madly in loveâ€”in just two weeks. Yet Linnet has no idea of the danger posed to her own heart by a man who may never love her in return. If she decides to be very wicked indeed . . . what price will she pay for taming his wild heart?	372	January 25th 2011	Linnet Berry Thrynne, Piers Yelverton, Earl of Marchant		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8449698-when-beauty-tamed-the-beast
