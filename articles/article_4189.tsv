Sarum: The Novel of England		Edward Rutherfurd	4.07	40860	1551	A masterpiece of breathtaking scope—a brilliantly conceived epic novel that traces the entire turbulent course of English history. This rich tapestry weaves a compelling saga of five families—the Wilsons, the Masons, the family of Porteus, the Shockleys, and the Godfreys—who reflect the changing character of Britain. As their fates and fortunes intertwine over the course of the centuries, their greater destinies offer a fascinating glimpse into the future. An absorbing historical chronicle, Sarum is a keen tale of struggle and adventure, a profound human drama, and a magnificent work of sheer storytelling.	912	May 7th 1987		United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1853145.Sarum
