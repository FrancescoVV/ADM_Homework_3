A Room of One's Own / Three Guineas		Virginia Woolf	4.17	3286	262	In these texts, Virginia Woolf considers the implications of the historical exclusion of women from education and from economic independence. In A Room of One's Own (1929), she examines the work of past women writers, and looks ahead to a time when women's creativity will not be hampered by poverty, or by oppression. In Three Guineas (1938), however, Woolf argues that women's historical exclusion offers them the chance to form a political and cultural identity which could challenge the drive towards fascism and war.	480	June 1938			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52228.A_Room_of_One_s_Own_Three_Guineas
