Good Things Happened Today		Christopher Atwood	2.82	60	16	“A dynamic inspirational fiction about personal growth and development.” Good Things Happened Today uniquely blends spiritual connection and introspection with action and adventure. When a self-consumed, obsessive materialist is thrust into the hands of Noah, a homeless divinity living in Central Park, the trajectory of his life is changed forever. Together, they embark upon a fantastic journey of transformation and enlightenment. More than just a story of individual growth and perspective, Good Things Happened Today chronicles the intersection of multiple lives in the battle between good and evil. The course of humanity hangs in the balance, shaped and determined by the choices our characters make along the way—created by the choices we make each day.	166	January 15th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10334012-good-things-happened-today
