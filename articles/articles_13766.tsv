My Friend Flicka	Flicka #1	Mary O'Hara, Dave Blossom	4.16	27992	354	It seems Ken can't do anything right. He loses saddle blankets and breaks reins...but then comes the worst news yet: a report card so bad that he has to repeat a grade. How can you tame the dreamy mind of a boy who stares out of the window instead of taking an exam? Enter Flicka, the chestnut filly with a wild spirit. Over the course of one magical summer, both will learn the meaning of responsibility, courage, and, ultimately, friendship.	304	1941	Ken McLaughlin (Flicka), Rob McLaughlin (Flicka), Nell McLaughlin (Flicka), Howard McLaughlin (Flicka), Flicka (Flicka), Gus (Flicka), Tim	United States of America, Wyoming (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164542.My_Friend_Flicka
