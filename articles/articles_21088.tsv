Martyn Pig		Kevin Brooks	3.58	2752	220	"Did I hate him? Of course I did. But I never meant to kill him." With his father dead, Martyn has a choice. Tell the police what happened - and be suspected of murder. Or get rid of the body and get on with the rest of his life. Simple, right? Not quite. One story leads to another. Secrets and lies become darker and crazier. And Martyn is faced with twists and turns that leave him reeling. Life is never easy. But death is even harder.	220	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/538915.Martyn_Pig
