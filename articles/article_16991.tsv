The Search for Artemis	The Chronicles of Landon Wicker #1	P.D. Griffith	3.79	98	27	Fifteen-year-old Landon Wicker is psychokinetic, but the tragic unleashing of his abilities forces him to run from everything he knows. Alone, terrified and unable to remember the events that compelled him to flee, Landon fights to survive and understand what's happening to him. He finds solace, however, in the company of hundreds of psychokinetics like him when he's brought to the Gymnasium. Forced into a life where people don't just see - but control - the world around them and teenagers lift city buses with a thought, Landon struggles to accept his new reality and the guilt over his painful secret. But everything changes when a chance encounter with a mysterious girl propels him on a hunt for answers. Uncovering dark truths the Gymnasium would do anything to keep hidden, Landon must choose where his loyalties lie. Will Landon accept his past - and his future? Will he discover the truth? What's hidden in the Restricted Tower, and who is Artemis?	388	January 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17796526-the-search-for-artemis
