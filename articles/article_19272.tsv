Go Fast: A Simon Ellice Adventure		Rod Humphris	3.31	13	7	A White-Knuckle Ride From the Seas of Morocco to the Sands of the Sahara Running drugs from North Africa to Spain is a dangerous game, but Simon Ellice makes his own rules. Battle-scarred from serving in Afghanistan, Si has a good thing going on moonless nights smuggling runs in his go-fast boat and he has an even better thing going with his boss's daughter. Si fears nothing, dares all, and lives by his own moral compass. Simon Ellice knows when the tide is turning against him. But when he tries to get out he's soon caught up in a tangle of corruption and forbidden love in an adventure that is thrilling, unpredictable and relentless. "This is an impressive piece of writing, highly charged, action packed, intelligent set in a vivid, exotic location with strong, memorable characters." - Martin Fletcher (Editor) "Humphris takes an old-fashioned approach to noir... Ellice himself is an enigma, who fans of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher are likely to enjoy. As the narrator of the story, what he doesn’t tell you isn’t worth knowing." - crimefictionlover.com What readers are saying about Go Fast: "Gripping, action filled, brilliantly staged, surprises, suspense, humor that made me laugh anyway and now I cannot wait for the next book." N.N. Light "A hero for the post-truth world."
