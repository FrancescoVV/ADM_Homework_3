Ride the River	The Sacketts #5	Louis L'Amour	4.09	4867	236	In Ride the River , Louis L’Amour spins the tale of a young woman who has to protect her family fortune from a murderous thief and teach him what it means to be a Sackett. Sixteen-year-old Echo Sackett had never been far from her Tennessee home—until she made the long trek to Philadelphia to collect an inheritance. Echo could take care of herself as well as any Sackett man, but James White, a sharp city lawyer, figured that cheating the money from the young girl would be like taking candy from a baby. If he couldn’t hoodwink Echo out of the cash, he’d just steal it from her outright. And if she put up a fight? There were plenty of accidents that could happen to a country girl on her first trip to the big city.	208	January 1st 1983	Echo Sackett, Finian Chantry, James White, Timothy Oats, Elmer, Dorian Chantry, Archie, Trulove Sackett, Felix Horst, Macon Sackett, Mordecai Sackett	Tuckalucky Cove, Tennessee (United States), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States), Ohio River Valley (United States), Kentucky , 1800 (United States), Kentucky (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/828166.Ride_the_River
