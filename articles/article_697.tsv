Lover Revealed	Black Dagger Brotherhood #4	J.R. Ward	4.30	122629	4584	Butch O'Neal is a fighter by nature. A hard-living ex-homicide cop, he's the only human ever to be allowed in the inner circle of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. And he wants to go even deeper into the vampire worldâ€”to engage in the turf war with the lessers. He's got nothing to lose. His heart belongs to a female vampire, an aristocratic beauty who's way out of his league. If he can't have Marissa, then at least he can fight side by side with the Brothers... Fate curses him with the very thing he wants. When Butch sacrifices himself to save a civilian vampire from the slayers, he falls prey to the darkest force in the war. Left for dead, he's found by a miracle, and the Brotherhood calls on Marissa to bring him back. But even her love may not be enough to save him...	480	March 6th 2007	Mary Luce, Marissa, Butch Brian O'Neal, Zsadist, Vishous (Black Dagger), Phury, Beth (Elizabeth) Randall, Xhexania, Tohrment, Rehvenge, Havers, Rhage, Wrath (Blind King)	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42898.Lover_Revealed
