Judy Moody Saves the World!	Judy Moody #3	Megan McDonald, Peter H. Reynolds	4.04	6913	316	Get ready, world--Judy is taking over in paperback (ages 6-10)! It all starts with the Crazy Strip contest -- and the dream that she, Judy Moody, might one day see her very own adhesive-bandage design covering the scraped knees of thousands. But when her "Heal the World" motif merits only an honorable mention, Judy realizes it's time to set her sights on something bigger. Class 3T is studying the environment, and Judy is amazed to learn about the destruction of the rain forest, the endangered species (not) in her own backyard, and her own family's crummy recycling habits. Now she's in a mood to whip the planet into shape -- or her name isn't Judy Monarch Moody!	160	January 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24157.Judy_Moody_Saves_the_World_
