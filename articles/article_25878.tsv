The Stockholm Octavo		Karen Engelmann	3.42	3564	605	Life is close to perfect for Emil Larsson, a self-satisfied bureaucrat in the Office of Customs and Excise in 1791 Stockholm. He is a true man of the Town--a drinker, card player, and contented bachelor--until one evening when Mrs. Sofia Sparrow, a fortune-teller and proprietor of an exclusive gaming parlor, shares with him a vision she has had: a golden path that will lead him to love and connection. She lays an Octavo for him, a spread of eight cards that augur the eight individuals who can help him realize this vision--if he can find them.	416	October 21st 2012	Emil Larsson, The Uzanne	Stockholm (Sweden)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13142835-the-stockholm-octavo
