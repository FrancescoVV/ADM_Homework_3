Now the Dark Kingdom readies itself for the arrival of its Queen, a Witch who will wield more power than even the High Lord of Hell himself. But she is still young, still open to influence--and corruption. Whoever controls the Queen controls the darkness. Three men--sworn enemies--know this. And they know the power that hides behind the blue eyes of an innocent young girl. And so begins a ruthless game of politics and intrigue, magic and betrayal, where the weapons are hate and love--and the prize could be terrible beyond imagining... --back cover	1204	December 2nd 2003	Jaenelle Angelline, Daemon Sadi SaDiablo, Saetan SaDiablo, Lucivar Yaslana, Surreal SaDiablo		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47953.The_Black_Jewels_Trilogy
