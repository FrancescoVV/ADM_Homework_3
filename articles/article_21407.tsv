She finds out about a heritage she never knew she had, and secrets from the past are uncovered as she fights to save her part of the world from destruction. And then there’s Mac, with his green eyes and a soft voice that flows through her like sweet honey. He’s there to help Wilder as she struggles with how to fit into the group of people around her dad, and with every bad thing that happens it becomes more important to have Mac in her life . “Wilder” is the first in the Birds of a Feather series and a spin-off from the Dreughan trilogy.
