Nuklear Age		Brian Clevinger	3.87	182	12	It's a tale of incompetence in the face of adversity. Or is it a story of adversity in the face of incompetence? Well, anyway, there's a robot, a giant monster, a line of evil toys, a mind control plot, sub-orbital death beams, kidnappers, bad movies, a super powered gang, an usurper, and a maniacal villain hell-bent on world domination. Not all at once, though. I mean, really, could you imagine coordinating the fight scene? Or reading it? You'd have to take notes just to keep track of who hit what and why.	664	September 14th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1020580.Nuklear_Age
