The Complete Works: The Revised Oxford Translation, Vol. 1	The Complete Works of Aristotle #1	Aristotle, Jonathan Barnes	4.43	2433	27	The Oxford Translation of Aristotle was originally published in 12 volumes between 1912 & 1954. It is universally recognized as the standard English version of Aristotle. This revised edition contains the substance of the original translation, slightly emended in light of recent scholarship; three of the original versions have been replaced by new translations; and a new and enlarged selection of Fragments has been added. The aim of the translation remains the same: to make the surviving works of Aristotle readily accessible to English speaking readers.	1757	-322			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19082.The_Complete_Works
