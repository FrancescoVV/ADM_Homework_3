The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake		Breece D'J Pancake, James Alan McPherson, Andre Dubus III, John Casey	4.14	4865	586	Breece D'J Pancake cut short a remarkably promising writing career when he took his own life in 1979 at the age of 26. In 1983 Little, Brown and Company's posthumous publication of this book electrified the literary world with a force that still resounds across two decades. A collection of stories that depict the world of Pancake's native rural West Virginia with astonishing power and grace, The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake has remained continuously in print and is a perennial favorite among aspiring writers, participants in creative writing programs, and students of contemporary American fiction. "Trilobites", the first of Pancake's stories to be published in The Atlantic, elicited an extraordinary immediate response from readers and continues to be widely anthologized.	192	February 1st 1983		West Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52762.The_Stories_of_Breece_D_J_Pancake
