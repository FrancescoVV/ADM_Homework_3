Breathing Underwater	Breathing Underwater #1	Alex Flinn	3.90	7875	1054	Like father, like son. Intelligent, popular, handsome, and wealthy, sixteen-year-old Nick Andreas is pretty much perfect--on the outside, at least. What no one knows--not even his best friend--is the terror that Nick faces every time he is alone with his father. Then he and Caitlin fall in love, and Nick thinks his problems are over. Caitlin is the one person who he can confide in. But when things start to spiral out of control, Nick must face the fact that he's gotten more from his father than green eyes and money.	263	April 24th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/389535.Breathing_Underwater
