One Week Girlfriend	One Week Girlfriend  #1	Monica  Murphy	3.93	51205	3293	Temporary. That one single word best describes my life these last few years. I’m working at a temporary job until I can finally break free. I’m my little brother’s temporary mother since our mom doesn’t give a crap about either of us. And I’m that temporary girl all the guys want to get with because I give it up so easily. According to the rumors, at least. But now I’m the temporary girlfriend of Drew Callahan, college football legend and all around golden guy. He’s beautiful, sweet—and he’s hiding way more secrets than I am. He’s brought me into this fake life where everyone seems to hate me. And everyone seems to want something from him. The only thing he seems to want though is… Me. I don’t know what to believe anymore. All I know is, I think Drew needs me. And I want to be there for him. Forever.	274	January 10th 2013	Fable Maguire, Drew Callahan	California (United States), Carmel, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17202452-one-week-girlfriend
