Shadowland		Peter Straub	3.90	11310	348	You have been thereâ€¦ if you have ever been afraid. Come back. To a dark house deep in the Vermont woods, where two friends are spending a season of horror, apprenticed to a Master Magician. Learning secrets best left unlearned. Entering a world of incalculable evil more ancient than death itself. More terrifying. And more real. Only one of them will make it through.	468	October 1980	Del Nightingale, Tom Flanagan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19580.Shadowland
