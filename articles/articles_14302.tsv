The Year My Sister Got Lucky		Aimee Friedman	3.69	1770	154	In this hilarious, heartrending novel, New York Times bestselling author Aimee Friedman reminds us of the importance of sisters. . . and of not wearing stilettos in the mud. When Katie and Michaela Wilder are uprooted from NYC and planted in rural Fir Lake, Katie is horrified by their new surroundings: the too-friendly neighbors, the local uniform of sandals paired with socks, the very idea of milking a cow. But while Katie suffers through shopping withdrawal, Michaela transforms into a small-town social firefly, flirting with the hot quarterback and soaking up nature with her new hick-town friends. As in, people who think camping is *fun*. Does Katie even know her sister anymore? And after Michaela hides a jaw-dropping secret from her, does Katie even want to?	370	March 1st 2008	Katya 'Katie' Wilder, Michaela Wilder, Autumn Hawthorne, Anders Swensen, Jasper Hawthorne, Sullivan Turner	New York City, New York (United States), Essex County, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1797044.The_Year_My_Sister_Got_Lucky
