Sunset at Blandings	Blandings Castle #12	P.G. Wodehouse	4.07	932	51	Wodehouse died before finishing this novel, which uses the Blandings formula: a pretty niece brought to the castle to separate her from a suitor; suitor infiltrated under an assumed name by Gally; Lord Emsworth innocently blowing the gaff to an angry sister. Wodehouse's notes complete the story.	151	November 1st 1977	Clarence Threepwood, Sebastian Beach, Galahad Threepwood, Freddie Threepwood, Daphne Littlewood Winkworth, Empress of Blandings, John Robinson, George Ovens, James Piper, Claude Duff, Brenda Piper, Florence Moresby, Victoria Underwood, E.B.
