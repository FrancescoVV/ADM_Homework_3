Like Water for Chocolate	Como agua para chocolate #1	Laura Esquivel, Thomas  Christensen, Carol Christensen	3.95	325173	9335	Earthy, magical, and utterly charming, this tale of family life in turn-of-the-century Mexico became a best-selling phenomenon with its winning blend of poignant romance and bittersweet wit. The number one bestseller in Mexico and America for almost two years, and subsequently a bestseller around the world, Like Water For Chocolate is a romantic, poignant tale, touched with moments of magic, graphic earthiness, bittersweet wit - and recipes. A sumptuous feast of a novel, it relates the bizarre history of the all-female De La Garza family. Tita, the youngest daughter of the house, has been forbidden to marry, condemned by Mexican tradition to look after her mother until she dies. But Tita falls in love with Pedro, and he is seduced by the magical food she cooks. In desperation, Pedro marries her sister Rosaura so that he can stay close to her, so that Tita and Pedro are forced to circle each other in unconsummated passion. Only a freakish chain of tragedies, bad luck and fate finally reunite them against all the odds.	222	1989	Tita de la Garza, Gertrudis de la Garza, Rosaura de la Garza, Mam√° Elena, Pedro Muzquiz, John Brown, Nacha, Chencha, Juan Alejandrez	Mexico	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6952.Like_Water_for_Chocolate
