Iron in the Soul	Les Chemins de la Libert√© #3	Jean-Paul Sartre	3.89	2011	110	June 1940 was the summer of defeat for the French soldiers, deserted by their officers, utterly demoralized, awaiting the Armistice. Day by day, hour by hour, Iron in the Soul unfolds what men thought and felt and did as France fell. Men who shrugged, men who ran, men who fought and tragic men like Mathieu, who had dedicated his life to finding personal freedom, now overwhelmed by remorse and bitterness, who must learn to kill. Iron in the Soul , the third volume of Sartre's Roads to Freedom Trilogy , is a harrowing depiction of war, and what it means to lose.	348	1949			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/625151.Iron_in_the_Soul
