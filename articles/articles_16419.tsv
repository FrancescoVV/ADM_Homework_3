The Unlikely Romance of Kate Bjorkman		Louise Plummer	3.88	1330	250	Hi, I'm Kate Bjorkman. What do you do if you've lived a real romance with a great guy and he loves you as much as you love him? Simple, I wrote a romance novel with help from THE ROMANCE WRITER'S PHRASE BOOK. Nothing is made up. I want truth and conflict even in romance. I'm betting you'll want the same.	192	March 1st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49745.The_Unlikely_Romance_of_Kate_Bjorkman
