With a Tangled Skein	Incarnations of Immortality #3	Piers Anthony	3.99	19646	308	THE WOMAN WHO WANTED REVENGE When the man Niobe loved was shot, she learned that she had been the target, in a devious plot of the Devil's. Hoping for revenge, Niobe accepted a position as one of the three Aspects of Fate, only to find that Satan's plots were tangled into the very Tapestry of Fate. Now the Evil One was laying a trap to ruin Niobe's granddaughter Luna, who threatened his plans—and he had tricked her son into Hell. Niobe's only chance to save her son and Luna was to accept a challenge by the Prince of Deceit—a challenge to be decided in Hell and in a maze of Satan's devising.	405	September 12th 1985	Orb Kaftan, Parry, Niobe Kaftan, Luna Kaftan, Magician Kaftan, Cedric Kaftan, Pacian Kaftan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76660.With_a_Tangled_Skein
