Laney	The Brookehaven Vampires #1	Joann I. Martin-Sowles	4.01	1894	207	In a small college town in Northern California, Laney Alexander leads a regular, uneventful life-that is, until the charming and alluring Oliver Knight enters her world. Who is this gorgeous and mysterious stranger? Or, rather, what is he? As Laney's sophomore year of college begins, so does an unbelievable adventure-including a love she didn't know she longed for. She soon learns that Oliver is not ordinary, nor is the rest of his family, including a sister who openly hates her and a brother who will stop at nothing for revenge. As she fights for her life, and Oliver's love, Laney discovers that the fictional world of vampires isn't so fictional after all. Nobody is safe, especially Laney, Oliver's most important priority, and he will stop at nothing to protect her. With her mortality at risk, and a commitment revealed that she, without a doubt, knows she wants, Laney's life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn...	296	October 29th 2010	Avery, Lola, Laney Alexander, Oliver Knight, Kiera Blake, Carter Thomas, Olivia Knight, Oscar Knight, Aunt Lilly, Professor Amber, Felix Alexander, Ashton, Gladys, Habitha, Isaac Scott, Julz, Hayden Scott		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8853482-laney
