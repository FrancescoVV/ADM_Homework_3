Curse the Dawn	Cassandra Palmer #4	Karen Chance	4.15	20703	559	Cassandra Palmer may be the all-powerful Pythia now, but that doesn’t mean people have stopped trying to kill her. Most of the supernatural power players don’t want the independent minded Cassie as chief clairvoyant—and they’ll stop at nothing to see her six feet under. The Vampire Senate does support Cassie in her position, but their protection comes with a price: an alliance with the sexy master vampire Mircea, who has claimed Cassie as his own. But even the vampires will have trouble keeping Cassie alive now that the self-styled god Apollo, the source of the Pythia’s power, has it in for her in a big way. To save her life—and the world—Cassie’s going to have to face down her creator once and for all.	386	March 1st 2009	Cassandra Palmer, John Pritkin, Mircea Basarab, Jonas Marsden		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3556419-curse-the-dawn
