Chimpanzees for Tea!		Jo Empson	3.64	385	73	A silly, fun version of the game "telephone"—in which a grocery list committed to memory goes playfully awry. One day, Vincent's mother asks him to go to the store to pick up a few items: "a bunch of carrots, a box of rice, some China tea, a big, firm pear, and a tin of peas" to be precise. "And hurry home in time for tea!" she says. Sounds easy enough. Yet distractions are at every turn, causing havoc with Vincent's memory. All of a sudden, a tin of peas is replaced by a trapeze; a big, firm pear becomes a big furry bear; and a box of rice transforms into a box of mice! Needless to say, Vincent's mother is in for quite a surprise. Told with a playful rhythm for reading aloud and illustrated with exuberance and great child appeal, this humorous picture book will have kids laughing and asking for repeated readings. Praise for Chimpanzees for Tea! "Award-winning British author/illustrator Empson energetically illustrates her tale of ever more outrageous memory lapses with scribbly watercolors full of swooping action and bouncing wildlife that follow the swirling text across the pages. Wild daubs of color emphasize the comically powerful wind and the mounting chaos. As much fun to read as it is to hear, and a real treat for the eyes."— Kirkus Reviews	32	April 26th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26026066-chimpanzees-for-tea
