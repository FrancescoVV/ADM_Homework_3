A Man Without a Country		Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Daniel Simon	4.08	38787	2590	In a volume that is penetrating, introspective, incisive, and laugh-out-loud funny, one of the great men of letters of this era—or any era—holds forth on life, art, sex, politics, and the state of America’s soul. Whether he is describing his coming of age in America, his formative war experiences, or his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, A Man Without a Country is intimate, tender, and brimming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegut’s passions.	160	2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4979.A_Man_Without_a_Country
