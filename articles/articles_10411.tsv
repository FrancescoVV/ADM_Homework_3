Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason		Michel Foucault, Richard Howard	4.10	10866	460	Michel Foucault examines the archeology of madness in the West from 1500 to 1800 – from the late Middle Ages, when insanity was still considered part of everyday life and fools and lunatics walked the streets freely, to the time when such people began to be considered a threat, asylums were first built, and walls were erected between the “insane” and the rest of humanity.	320	1961			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51933.Madness_and_Civilization
