The Book of Ruth		A.J. Bialo	5.00	1	1	It's 1978 and Cardinal Joshua Argus has his eye on the ultimate prize of becoming the next Pope at any cost. To achieve his goal he must do two things: make sure there is a vacancy for the position and clean up his past to avoid a scandalous ascension. Standing in his way is a young rookie homicide detective named Kathryn Krol who is investigating his murderous cleanup plan in Syracuse, New York. But with the Cardinal now safely in Rome and beyond New York law, will she be able to stop him before he commits the ultimate murder from within the Vatican?	400	November 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7912465-the-book-of-ruth
