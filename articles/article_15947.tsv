Play With Me	Grover Beach Team #1	Piper Shelly, Anna Katmore	3.91	13963	1035	What if you had to do the one thing you hated most to get the guy you loved to notice you? Ryan Hunter’s parties are legend. And tonight she’s going to be there. Lisa Matthews anticipates the return of her best friend and only love since kindergarten from soccer camp. But when Tony finally shows up, his mind is more focused on another girl. And worse, she’s a soccer player. Fighting for the attention Lisa craves, she’s just a hairbreadth away from making a very stupid decision. But when extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, she’s prepared to play ball to get her man. The tryouts are hell, the first match ends bloody, and the morning after the selection party she wakes up in the worst place possible—in the arms of the captain of the soccer team. The hottest guy in school… Ryan Hunter.	238	December 8th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19263293-play-with-me
