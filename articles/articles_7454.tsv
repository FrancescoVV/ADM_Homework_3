Before You Know Kindness		Chris Bohjalian	3.47	10742	1126	Chris Bohjalian, bestselling author of Midwives , presents his most ambitious and multi-layered novel to date--examining wildly divisive issues in today’s America with his trademark emotional heft and spellbinding storytelling skill. On a balmy July night in New Hampshire a shot rings out in a garden, and a man falls to the ground, terribly wounded. The wounded man is Spencer McCullough, the shot that hit him was fired–accidentally?–by his adolescent daughter Charlotte. With this shattering moment of violence, Chris Bohjalian launches the best kind of literate page-turner: suspenseful, wryly funny, and humane.	429	January 1st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16046.Before_You_Know_Kindness
