Sink or Swim	Art & Coll #3	Kate Cann	3.65	739	20	I sat back on my bed, heart hammering. So that's what I was. A friend. You weren't my friend, Art. You were my lover. Friends make you laugh and support you and stop you feeling alone. They don't make you go to bed night after night curled up in misery. You're not my friend.	313	January 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/957346.Sink_or_Swim
