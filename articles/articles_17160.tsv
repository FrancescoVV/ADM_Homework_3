The Fine Art of Truth or Dare		Melissa Jensen	3.32	7474	733	Pretty in Pink meets Anna and the French Kiss in this charming romantic comedy Ella is nearly invisible at the Willing School, and that's just fine by her. She's got her friends - the fabulous Frankie and their sweet cohort Sadie. She's got her art - and her idol, the unappreciated 19th-century painter Edward Willing. Still, it's hard being a nobody and having a crush on the biggest somebody in the school: Alex Bainbridge. Especially when he is your French tutor, and lessons have started becoming, well, certainly more interesting than French ever has been before. But can the invisible girl actually end up with a happily ever after with the golden boy, when no one even knows they're dating? And is Ella going to dare to be that girl?	380	February 1st 2012	Ella Marino, Alex Bainbridge	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11698943-the-fine-art-of-truth-or-dare
