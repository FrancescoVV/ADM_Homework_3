Someone is tormenting her patients, pushing them to commit suicide, and setting her up to take the blame. But Tess can't break her oath to protect her patients' privacy at all costs. Even when detective Aidan Reagan demands a list of everyone she's treating. Even when the mounting danger threatens Tess herself. Aidan doesn't like anyone who stalls his cases. Still, he can't help but admire Tess's fierce loyalty to her patients, especially when it becomes clear that a nameless, faceless enemy is set on destroying her career, her family , and finally, Tess herself. As Aidan's heart softens, the killer's will hardens, and one thing becomes clear â€” the noose is tightening around Tess's neck.	499	April 1st 2006	Detective Mia Mitchell, Dr. Tess Ciccotelli, ASA Kristen Mayhew, Detective Abe Reagan, Detective Vito Ciccotelli, Detective Aidan Reagan, Detective Todd Murphy, Sgt.
