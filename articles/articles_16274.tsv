The Serpent Sea	The Books of the Raksura #2	Martha Wells	4.07	4314	344	Moon, once a solitary wanderer, has become consort to Jade, sister queen of the Indigo Cloud court. Together, they travel with their people on a pair of flying ships in hopes of finding a new home for their colony. Moon finally feels like he's found a tribe where he belongs. But when the travelers reach the ancestral home of Indigo Cloud, shrouded within the trunk of a mountain-sized tree, they discover a blight infecting its core. Nearby they find the remains of the invaders who may be responsible, as well as evidence of a devastating theft. This discovery sends Moon and the hunters of Indigo Cloud on a quest for the heartstone of the tree — a quest that will lead them far away, across the Serpent Sea.	340	January 3rd 2012	Jade, Pearl, Stone, Chime, Flower (Martha Wells), Moon (Raksura)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11834447-the-serpent-sea
