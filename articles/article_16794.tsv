Hell Phone		William Sleator	3.51	616	95	A murder story with a devilish twist. Nick wants a cell phone so he can talk to his girlfriend, Jen, after school, but he doesn't have a lot of money. The used phone he buys seems like a bargain, until the phone calls begin—strangers calling night and day, some begging for help, others making demands. Nick wants to get rid of the phone, but something prevents him, and, soon he finds himself committing crimes—stealing, conning . . .and killing.	252	September 26th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24880.Hell_Phone
