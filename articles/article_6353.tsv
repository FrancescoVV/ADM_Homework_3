The Deep End of the Ocean	Cappadora Family #1	Jacquelyn Mitchard	3.87	116551	1251	Few first novels receive the kind of attention and acclaim showered on this powerful story—a nationwide bestseller, a critical success, and the first title chosen for Oprah's Book Club. Both highly suspenseful and deeply moving, The Deep End of the Ocean imagines every mother's worst nightmare—the disappearance of a child—as it explores a family's struggle to endure, even against extraordinary odds. Filled with compassion, humor, and brilliant observations about the texture of real life, here is a story of rare power, one that will touch readers' hearts and make them celebrate the emotions that make us all one.	464	1996		Wisconsin (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5161.The_Deep_End_of_the_Ocean
