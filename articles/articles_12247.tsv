Weapon	Whisper #2	Lynette Noni	4.34	1485	208	The #1 bestselling WHISPER series concludes with WEAPON: I already knew he was a psychopath. But now? He's more dangerous than ever. And I have less than twenty-four hours to stop him. After escaping Lengard and finding sanctuary with the Remnants, Alyssa Scott is desperate to save those she left behind ─ and the rest of the world ─ from the power-hungry scientist, Kendall Vanik. But secrets and lies block her at every turn, and soon Lyss is left questioning everything she has ever believed. When long-lost memories begin to surface and the mysteries of her past continue to grow, Lyss battles to retain her hard-won control. Allies become enemies and enemies become allies, leaving her certain about only two things: when it comes to Speakers, nothing is ever as it seems... and the only person she can trust is herself.	407	November 4th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45880884-weapon
