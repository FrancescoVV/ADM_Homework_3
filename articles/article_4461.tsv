Dream Country	The Sandman #3	Neil Gaiman, Kelley Jones, Charles Vess, Colleen Doran, Malcolm Jones III, Steve Erickson	4.24	98200	2129	The third volume of the Sandman collection is a series of four short comic book stories. In each of these otherwise unrelated stories, Morpheus serves only as a minor character. Here we meet the mother of Morpheus's son, find out what cats dream about, and discover the true origin behind Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Night Dream. The latter won a World Fantasy Award for best short story, the first time a comic book was given that honor. collecting The Sandman #17â€“20	111	1990	Dream of the Endless, Element Girl, Death of the Endless		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25100.Dream_Country
