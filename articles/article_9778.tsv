The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice		Christopher Hitchens	4.06	9137	756	Among his many books, perhaps none have sparked more outrage than The Missionary Position , Christopher Hitchens's meticulous study of the life and deeds of Mother Teresa. A Nobel Peace Prize recipient beatified by the Catholic Church in 2003, Mother Teresa of Calcutta was celebrated by heads of state and adored by millions for her work on behalf of the poor. In his measured critique, Hitchens asks only that Mother Teresa's reputation be judged by her actions-not the other way around. With characteristic elan and rhetorical dexterity, Hitchens eviscerates the fawning cult of Teresa, recasting the Albanian missionary as a spurious, despotic, and megalomaniacal operative of the wealthy who long opposed measures to end poverty, and fraternized, for financial gain, with tyrants and white-collar criminals throughout the world.	98	October 17th 1995	Robert Maxwell, Pat Robertson, Benito Mussolini, Mother Teresa, Thomas Paine, Enver Hoxha, Jean-Claude Duvalier, Fran√ßois Duvalier, Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Charles Keating, Marion Barry, Arianna Huffington, Tariq Ali, Malcolm Muggeridge, Indira Gandhi, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Zog, King of Albania, Clare Boothe Luce, John Henry Newman, Peter Chafer, Ken MacMillan, Susan Shields, Roger Delano Hinkins, William F.
