Facing Your Giants: God Still Does the Impossible		Max Lucado	4.45	15336	396	You know your Goliath. You recognize his walk, the thunder of his voice. He taunts you with bills you can't pay, people you can't please, habits you can't break, failures you can't forget, and a future you can't face. But just like David, you can face your giant, even if you aren't the strongest, the smartest, the best equipped, of the holiest. David. You could read his story and wonder what God saw in him. His life has little to offer the unstained, straight-A saint. He fell as often as he stood, stumbled as often as he conquered. But for those who know the sound of Goliath, David gives this reminder: Focus on giants -- you stumble; focus on God -- your giants tumble. If you're ready to face your giants, let his story inspire you. The same God who helped him will help you.	233	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74169.Facing_Your_Giants
