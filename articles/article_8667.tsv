Malina		Ingeborg Bachmann, Philip Boehm	4.05	2350	164	Bachmann tells the story of lives painfully intertwined: the unnamed narrator, haunted by nightmarish memories of her father, lives with the androgynous Malina, an initially remote and dispassionate man who ultimately becomes an ominous influence. Plunging toward its riveting finale, Malina brutally lays bare the struggle for love and the limits of discourse between women and men.	244	1971			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/265987.Malina
