Downbelow Station	The Company Wars #1	C.J. Cherryh	3.92	13546	610	A legend among sci-fi readers, C. J. Cherryh 's Union-Alliance novels, while separate and complete in themselves, are part of a much larger tapestryâ€”a future history spanning 5,000 years of human civilization. A blockbuster space opera of the rebellion between Earth and its far-flung colonies, it is a classic science fiction masterwork.	526	1981	Signy Mallory, Damon Konstatin, Elene Quen, Josh Talley, Conrad Mazian		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57045.Downbelow_Station
