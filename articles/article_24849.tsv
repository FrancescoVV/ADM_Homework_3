All That Glitters	Avalon: Web of Magic #2	Rachel Roberts	4.07	1571	53	Emily and Adriane each have one thing Kara lacks—a magic gem. But when Kara finally finds a magic stone of her own—a diamond unicorn horn—it brings more trouble than the girls can handle. Pesky dragonflies start showing up everywhere and new Fairimentals appear, warning of danger. Worst of all, a band of terrifying monsters is stalking Kara. Overcoming these perils may bring the teens one step closer to Avalon, the source of all magic. But it may also cost one of them her life. All That Glitters is the second book in Avalon: Web of Magic , a twelve-book fantasy series for middle grade readers. Through their magical journey, the teenage heroines discover who they really are . . . and run into plenty of good guys, bad guys, and cute guys.	184	September 17th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15792386-all-that-glitters
