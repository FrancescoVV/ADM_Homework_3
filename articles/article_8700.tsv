Pied Piper		Nevil Shute	4.21	3334	366	It is the summer of 1940 and in Europe the time of Blitzkrieg. John Howard, a 70-year-old Englishman vacationing in France, cuts shorts his tour and heads for home. He agrees to take two children with him. But war closes in. Trains fail, roads clog with refugees. And if things were not difficult enough, other children join in Howard's little band. At last they reach the coast and find not deliverance but desperation. The old Englishman's greatest test lies ahead of him.	246	1942		London, England (United Kingdom), Jura (France), Dijon (France), Joigny , 1940 (France) Montargis , 1940 (France) Angerville , 1940 (France) Chartres , 1940 (France) Rennes , 1940 (France) Landerneau , 1940 (France), Joigny (France), Montargis (France), Angerville (France), Chartres (France), Rennes (France), Landerneau (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107315.Pied_Piper
