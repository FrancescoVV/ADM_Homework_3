An Unwanted Guest		Shari Lapena	3.78	58555	6616	A weekend retreat at a cozy mountain lodge is supposed to be the perfect getaway . . . but when the storm hits, no one is getting away It's winter in the Catskills and Mitchell's Inn, nestled deep in the woods, is the perfect setting for a relaxing--maybe even romantic--weekend away. It boasts spacious old rooms with huge woodburning fireplaces, a well-stocked wine cellar, and opportunities for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or just curling up with a good murder mystery. So when the weather takes a turn for the worse, and a blizzard cuts off the electricity--and all contact with the outside world--the guests settle in and try to make the best of it. Soon, though, one of the guests turns up dead--it looks like an accident. But when a second guest dies, they start to panic. Within the snowed-in paradise, something--or someone--is picking off the guests one by one. And there's nothing they can do but hunker down and hope they can survive the storm--and one another.	290	July 26th 2018	Gwen Delaney, Riley Shuter, David Paley, Lauren Day, Ian Beeton, Beverly Sullivan, Henry Sullivan, Dana Hart, Matthew Hutchinson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38240386-an-unwanted-guest
