The Wailing	Liminality #0.4	M.R. Graham	4.30	50	23	With Nazi bombs falling from the sky and fires consuming London, reluctant immortal Daniel Leland finds himself in an uncomfortable position. As a halfhearted employee of the British government, blackmailed into submission, he is forced to use his peculiar talent for murder in the service of the Crown. But as the assignments become impossibly challenging, the limits of that talent are tested. The Luftwaffe is not the most explosive thing to menace Great Britain, and even dead things can die again. There is more at stake than the questionable life of a lone agent, more at stake than Daniel Leland would care to admit.	102	October 2012	Rowan, Daniel Leland, Signe	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16119172-the-wailing
