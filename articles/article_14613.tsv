The Kid Who Came From Space		Ross Welford	4.21	263	31	The stunning new 10+ story from the bestselling and award-winning author of TIME TRAVELLING WITH A HAMSTER, for anyone who loved the humour of WALL-E, the action of STAR WARS and the deeply touching emotion of ET. A small village in the wilds of Northumberland is rocked by the disappearance of twelve-year-old Tammy. Only her twin brother, Ethan, knows she is safe – and the extraordinary truth of where she is. It is a secret he must keep, or risk never seeing her again. But that doesn’t mean he’s going to give up. Together with his friend Iggy and the mysterious (and very hairy) Hellyann, Ethan teams up with a spaceship called Philip, and Suzy the trained chicken, for a nail-biting chase to get his sister back… that will take him further than anyone has ever been before. A remarkable story of sibling connection, friendship and interstellar adventure from the author Kiran Millwood Hargrave called “one of my favourite middle grade writers”.	416	January 9th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52289992-the-kid-who-came-from-space
