Voice of the Eagle	Kwani #2	Linda Lay Shuler	4.20	2652	74	In VOICE OF THE EAGLE, Linda Lay Shuler continues her Time Circle Quartet as Kwani, "She Who Remembers," her mate Tolonqua and their newborn son begin their trek to Cicuye, Tolonqua's home. Cicuye is a pueblo city, an outpost where desert canyons meet the verdant buffalo range. Danger lurks there, for marauding tribes prey on the village with savage ferocity. Kwani and Tolonqua argue for a new city, fortified and safe, high on the ridge. But others fear leaving their ancestral home. With battle near, this split within threatens the town's survival as much as the gathering tribes without.p"Historically valid and carefully reconstructed, this story of life in America prior to its discovery by Columbus kindles the imagination."
