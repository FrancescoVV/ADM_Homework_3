Knife of Dreams	The Wheel of Time #11	Robert Jordan	4.14	102395	2171	The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the surviving seals on the Dark One's prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers. The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph.	860	October 3rd 2005	Rand al'Thor, Nynaeve al'Meara, Egwene al'Vere, Perrin Aybara, Al'Lan Mandragoran, Matrim Cauthon, Min Farshaw, Elayne Trakand, Aviendha, Siuan Sanche		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13888.Knife_of_Dreams
