Master of the Game	The Game #1	Sidney Sheldon	4.12	50876	1793	One of Sidney Sheldon's most popular and bestselling titles, repackaged and reissued for a new generation of fans. Kate Blackwell is one of the richest and most powerful women in the world. She is an enigma, a woman surrounded by a thousand unanswered questions. Her father was a diamond prospector who struck it rich beyond his wildest dreams. Her mother was the daughter of a crooked Afrikaaner merchant. Her conception was itself an act of hate-filled vengeance. At the extravagent celebrations of her ninetieth birthday, there are toasts from a Supreme Court Judge and a telegram from the White House. And for Kate there are ghosts, ghosts of absent friends and of enemies. Ghosts from a life of blackmail and murder. Ghosts from an empire spawned by naked ambition! Sidney Sheldon is one of the most popular storytellers in the world. This is one of his best-loved novels, a compulsively readable thriller, packed with suspense, intrigue and passion. It will recruit a new generation of fans to his writing.	489	August 1982	Eve, Alexandra Jones, Anthony "Tony" Blackwell, Kate Blackwell, David Blackwell, Jamie Mcgregor, Salomon van der Merwe, Margaret van der Merwe, Dr. Peter Templeton	Klipdrift (South Africa), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43330.Master_of_the_Game
