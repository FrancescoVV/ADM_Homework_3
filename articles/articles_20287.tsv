Off Grid	Off Grid #1	Backwoods	3.76	17	3	[image] If the world you know today were gone tomorrow, would you survive? Johnny & Rae Lynn Tapper find safety in solitude, hidden deep within the shelter of the Rocky Mountains. Terrorists have taken away the country they once knew and they survive, secluded and alone, by living off the land. They live wild new lives in a wild new world, living among the wild animals of the vast Colorado wilderness. There are no phones. There is no power. There are few people. They are completely 'Off Grid'. Excerpt: “The screeching and squawking had me searching around the birds at four in the morning. I was equipped with a flashlight, a shotgun, my boxers and boots. Had I known I would encounter the wolves, I would have gotten dressed and come better armed.” -Off Grid- Contains violence, drug use and profanity. Not suitable for children.
