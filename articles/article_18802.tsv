The Book of Blots		Stubba	4.67	6	1	This is the authorised second edition of Stubba's original "Book of Blots", first published as a collection in 1991 and long since out of print. Stubba was the founder of the original (London-based) Odinic Rite, which published the first edition. That work has now been computer-scanned to ensure accuracy of the genuine text in a completely new, re-formatted version.	120	1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24186763-the-book-of-blots
