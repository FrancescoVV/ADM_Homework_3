Dead by Morning	Rituals of the Night #1	Kayla Krantz	3.71	287	116	Obsession is deadly. No one learns that better than Luna Ketz, a pessimistic high school senior. Caught between the intentions of her Muslim father and business-minded mother, boys are the last thing on Luna’s mind, but this fact doesn’t detour the mysterious Chance Welfrey from trying to gain her affection. Luna doesn’t think twice about him until girls at their high school begin to disappear. Girls who tended to hurt her. Girls she wished would disappear. When she receives a call from a long-lost friend, normalcy goes out the window as she’s plunged into the paranormal. There’s a world beneath the surface of the unconscious mind, and the killer knows how to navigate it. Luna is in danger and although she can avoid the killer in reality, she cannot avoid him in her dreams. *Rated for mature adult themes and depictions of violence*	426	May 1st 2015	Luna Ketz, Chance Welfrey, Max Cazmea, Violet Bulrney, Amy Jiminez	Lima, Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45181769-dead-by-morning
