Flaubert in Egypt: A Sensibility on Tour		Gustave Flaubert, Francis Steegmuller	3.63	414	40	At once a classic of travel literature and a penetrating portrait of a “sensibility on tour,” Flaubert in Egypt wonderfully captures the young writer’s impressions during his 1849 voyages. Using diaries, letters, travel notes, and the evidence of Flaubert’s traveling companion, Maxime Du Camp, Francis Steegmuller reconstructs his journey through the bazaars and brothels of Cairo and down the Nile to the Red Sea.	230	1849		Egypt	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2178.Flaubert_in_Egypt
