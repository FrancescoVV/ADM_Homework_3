Letters to a Young Contrarian		Christopher Hitchens	4.14	10123	660	From bestselling author and provocateur Christopher Hitchens, the classic guide to the art of principled dissent and disagreement In Letters to a Young Contrarian , bestselling author and world-class provocateur Christopher Hitchens inspires the radicals, gadflies, mavericks, rebels, and angry young (wo)men of tomorrow. Exploring the entire range of "contrary positions"--from noble dissident to gratuitous nag--Hitchens introduces the next generation to the minds and the misfits who influenced him, invoking such mentors as Emile Zola, Rosa Parks, and George Orwell. As is his trademark, Hitchens pointedly pitches himself in contrast to stagnant attitudes across the ideological spectrum. No other writer has matched Hitchens's understanding of the importance of disagreement--to personal integrity, to informed discussion, to true progress, to democracy itself.	141	2001	Bertrand Russell, Noam Chomsky, Henry Kissinger, George Orwell, Thabo Mbeki, Ayn Rand, Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, E.P.
