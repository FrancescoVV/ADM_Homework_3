Mute: Poems That Saved My Life!: Poems by Vidya Gargote During Her Journey Battling with Depression		Vidya Gargote	5.00	1	0	MUTE: Poems That Saved My Life! is an inspirational assortment of verses that is filled with the beautiful emotions of my journey. Readers will be able to associate themselves with my journey through these rhymes. The soul of this book lies in helping understand our own emotions. We all know what depression is, but this book brings out the nuances. We reject that we have depression and fall prey to its games. I suggest we radically accept it and bring major changes in our life. This is where you will find the difference between the dark and the light. You can make profound changes in your life only when you understand yourself better.	210	October 21st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23466527-mute
