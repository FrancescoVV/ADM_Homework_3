Boys Are Dogs	Annabelle Unleashed  #1	Leslie Margolis	3.78	2776	317	The book that inspired the Disney Channel movie Zapped , starring Zendaya! When Annabelle returns from summer camp, her life is totally different. She's moving to a new house with her mom's new boyfriend, and that means starting sixth grade at a brand-new school. Birchwood Middle School is very different from her old all-girls elementary-the boys practically run wild in the hallways. And at home, Annabelle's new puppy is taking over the house and chewing on her clothes. But the puppy came with a training manual, so Annabelle might be able to get one thing under control. Unless . . . can you train a boy the way you train a dog?	195	September 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3494684-boys-are-dogs
