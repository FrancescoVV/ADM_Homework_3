An Evil Cradling		Brian Keenan	4.34	1946	133	Brian Keenan went to Beirut in 1985 for a change of scene from his native Belfast. He became headline news when he was kidnapped by fundamentalist Shi'ite militiamen and held in the suburbs of Beirut for the next four and a half years. For much of that time he was shut off from all news and contact with anyone other than his jailers and, later, his fellow hostages, amongst them John McCarthy.	352	October 27th 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/901570.An_Evil_Cradling
