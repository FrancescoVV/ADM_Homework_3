The Bell at Sealey Head		Patricia A. McKillip	3.99	2459	258	Sealey Head is a small sleepy town on the edge of the ocean, where sunset marks the tolling of a bell no one can see. On the outskirts is the great Aislinn House, where heir Miss Miranda Beryl and her entourage of friends and servants wait while aged Lady Eglantyne dies; where maid Emma opens doors sometimes to a castle with Princess Ysabo and knights.	277	September 2nd 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2917367-the-bell-at-sealey-head
