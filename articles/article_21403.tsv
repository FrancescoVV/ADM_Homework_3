My Existence Craves Yours		Amna Dhanani	4.41	74	36	My Existence Craves Yours is about how one heart seeks out the other in love, as if you’re drought and they’re rain. It’s a story that contains true love, trauma of a broken heart, mental illness, imprisonment of one’s soul and lessons of life. Amna Dhanani says, “I went through my work trying to come up with a theme, I wrecked my brain for weeks until I saw a pattern for a story. I’ve arranged the poems in a way that each poem has a place in the flow, even though the order that I’ve made is fictional but I’ve not only felt but lived every word that is in here, some by me and some by others as I couldn’t stop myself from writing what my eyes saw, what my ears heard and what my heart felt through the pain of those around me. It often made my own existence suffer from their grief. After the story, I’ve shared bits and pieces about my suffering and survival, ending on The Words chapter.”	218	October 7th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42356004-my-existence-craves-yours
