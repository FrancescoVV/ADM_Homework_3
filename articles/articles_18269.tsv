Fiends		John Farris, Joe DeVito	3.62	189	18	In the frozen pit of blackest hell, Death sleeps. Ravishing beyond words, evil beyond our darkest dreams of Satan, Her eyelids flutter. Rising from Her pit, She wakes her vampire brood -- and frees them from their ancient graves. No, no one is safe, no one -- from the unwashed Children of Eve.	448	January 1st 1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363046.Fiends
