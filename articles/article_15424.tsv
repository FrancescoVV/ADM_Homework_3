The Kalevala		Elias Lönnrot, Anonymous, Keith Bosley	4.06	4536	308	The national folk epic of Finland is here presented in an English translation that is both scholarly and eminently readable. The lyrical passages and poetic images, the wry humor, the tall-tale extravagance, and the homely realism of the 'Kalevala' come through with extraordinary effectiveness.	679	1835	Väinämöinen, Joukahainen, Lemminkäinen, Ilmarinen, Kullervo, Louhi, Hiisi, Kalevatar, Aino	Finland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/400869.The_Kalevala
