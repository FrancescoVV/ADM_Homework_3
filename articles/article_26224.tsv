Mountain Solo		Jeanette Ingold	3.69	158	22	Sixteen-year-old Tess's life has been shaped by her violin. From the moment she picked up the instrument, it's been clear she isn't like other kids. She is a prodigy, and her life is that of a virtuoso-to-be: constant training, special schools, and a big debut before an audience of thousands. But when she blows her moment in the spotlight, she throws it all away, moves away from New York City to join her father in Montana, and tries to lead a normal life--whatever that is. Tess has hardly arrived when she is drawn into a mystery: a hunt for the wilderness homestead of a lost pioneer who played violin himself. Maybe, through his story, Tess will find the strength to pick up her violin again.	309	September 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13274673-mountain-solo
