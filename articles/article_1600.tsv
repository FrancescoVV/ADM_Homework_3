More Than This		Patrick Ness	3.98	49248	6962	A boy drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments. He dies. Then he wakes, naked and bruised and thirsty, but alive. How can this be? And what is this strange deserted place? As he struggles to understand what is happening, the boy dares to hope. Might this not be the end? Might there be more to this life, or perhaps this afterlife? From multi-award-winning Patrick Ness comes one of the most provocative and moving novels of our time.	480	September 1st 2013	Seth Wearing		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21969786-more-than-this
