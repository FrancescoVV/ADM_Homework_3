Donkey Gospel		Tony Hoagland	4.14	1672	95	Winner of the 1997 James Laughlin Award of The Academy of American Poets In his second collection of poems, Hoagland's generous effervescence and a jujitsu cleverness sparkle through line after line confronting negotiation and compromise, gender and culture, sex and rock music, sons and lovers, truth and beauty, and so forth. From the boy who speaks only in "Kung Fu" dialogue to the guy who visits a lesbian bar and sees his mother, this often funny and always thoughtful book of poems offers fresh, surprisingly frank meditations on the credentials for contemporary manhood.	80	February 1st 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135917.Donkey_Gospel
