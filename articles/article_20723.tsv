How To Build a Pallet and Plastic Bottle Greenhouse from Junk: A Self-Build Project		Eco T.	3.50	6	1	Constructing greenhouses from a variety of materials has seen a surge in popularity, as people move toward lower-cost, environmentally-friendly options. As with most self-build projects, you have the advantage of also being the designer, and there are many benefits to being able to make your structure the shape and size of your own choosing to suit both the space available and the purpose for which it is intended. With simple instructions and 19 colour photographs, I show you how I constructed my greenhouse from start to finish using mainly found - i.e. free - materials, and offer tips on where best to site your own construction; what materials to use, and the best way to use them.	32	July 22nd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24176059-how-to-build-a-pallet-and-plastic-bottle-greenhouse-from-junk
