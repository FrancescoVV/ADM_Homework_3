Yoga Time		Alex Letner	4.77	39	6	A graphic novel- adventures, science fiction, mystic, very light funny erotica. A young man named Indy, certified yoga master in his 18 years of age, comes from a small town to study in the college the theory of magic. At the moment Indy is living with his girlfriend Allis, 26 in the house of her mother Tesha. Tesha, a pretty, attractive woman, had suffered an attack of unusual weakness and dizziness right when a part from “The Great Book of Yoga” was being read by Indy in his full voice. Tesha is a lady with modern and progressive views, is an employee of a scientifically oriented industrial plant. Her bravery and decisiveness was the reason someone named her the “Witch”. Even more things happen. Somehow, she was able to purchase a very specific “Opus D” photo camera. That camera is known in a very narrow circle of professionals and was considered by them like a magic property item. But, how can a devise made out of metal and plastic parts be magic? In this case, any machine can possess magic properties. Tesha, in spite of being a very pretty woman is sad for some unpleasant circumstances in her life: she has not practiced love for about two years already. She became depressed about this until she met some young men who represented themselves as…angels. And more things were happen.
