The Stars My Destination		Alfred Bester, Neil Gaiman	4.10	42681	2751	In this pulse-quickening novel, Alfred Bester imagines a future in which people "jaunte" a thousand miles with a single thought, where the rich barricade themselves in labyrinths and protect themselves with radioactive hit men â€” and where an inarticulate outcast is the most valuable and dangerous man alive. The Stars My Destination is a classic of technological prophecy and timeless narrative enchantment by an acknowledged master of science fiction.	258	1955	Gulliver Foyle, Jisbella McQueen, Saul Dagenham, Presteign, Sam Quatt, Regis Sheffield, Robin Wednesbury		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/333867.The_Stars_My_Destination
