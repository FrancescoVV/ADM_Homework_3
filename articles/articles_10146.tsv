Magic Shifts	Kate Daniels #8	Ilona Andrews	4.44	33911	2312	In the latest Kate Daniels novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Ilona Andrews, magic is coming and going in waves in post-Shift Atlanta—and each crest leaves danger in its wake… After breaking from life with the Pack, mercenary Kate Daniels and her mate—former Beast Lord Curran Lennart—are adjusting to a very different pace. While they’re thrilled to escape all the infighting, Curran misses the constant challenges of leading the shapeshifters. So when the Pack offers him its stake in the Mercenary Guild, Curran seizes the opportunity—too bad the Guild wants nothing to do with him and Kate. Luckily, as a veteran merc, Kate can take over any of the Guild’s unfinished jobs in order to bring in money and build their reputation. But what Kate and Curran don’t realize is that the odd jobs they’ve been working are all connected. An ancient enemy has arisen, and Kate and Curran are the only ones who can stop it—before it takes their city apart piece by piece…	342	August 4th 2015	Kate Daniels, Curran Lennart, Derek Gaunt, Jim Shrapshire, Dr. George Doolittle, Dali Harimau, Mahon Delany, Ghastek, Rowena (People), Julie Olsen, Ascanio Ferara, Barabas Gilliam, Roland, the Builder of Towers, George (werebear), Nick Feldman	Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333171-magic-shifts
