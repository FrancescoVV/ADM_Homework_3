Fate's Pawn		Rick Fox	4.33	167	6	Everyone believes that Raziel’s parents are long dead. Everyone but Raziel. He knows the flying city that took them is real. He is sure that if he can just find it, he can find them too. And the first step to finding them is getting answers from a creature living in an ancient, abandoned fortress just a few miles away. To get to it Raziel will need a way past the high walls and the knights that guard his town, through the twisting forest paths and to defend himself against the monsters lurking among the trees. Answers to questions that have tormented him for years are just within reach. Or so he thinks. The fort is not the mere ruin he thought and Raziel is not the only one seeking it. Someone from his home has made a deal for terrible power and his master is neither kind nor forgiving. They want the creature defending the fort dead and if Raziel is going to find his answers he will have to face them, a horde of monsters, disbelief from the adults around him and his own inner demons. But Raziel won’t let any of that stop him. After all, it wouldn’t be fun without a challenge.	405	February 1st 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50901964-fate-s-pawn
