Dark Redemption	Pure/Dark Ones #6	Aja James	4.50	193	62	All his existence, he’s fought for the wrong side… Born and trained to be the most fearsome Dark warrior the immortal races had ever seen, Enlil of Anatolia had only ever known ruthlessness, brutality and rigid control. He was a weapon used by others, his life never his own. Until he spits in the eye of Fate… No longer able to abide by the atrocities he witnessed and engendered, he severs all ties to the past, risking his own life and sanity, and awakens a nameless man without memory. And is taken in by a human woman in search of her own Destiny… Raised in an orphanage, Clara Scott has always wanted a family of her own. Full of love, life and hope, she adopts a lost little girl and befriends a homeless man. In his eyes, she sees endless darkness and pain. But through his actions, she sees a strong, noble, imperfect, yet beautiful spirit— She sees a soul worth redeeming.	244	October 10th 2018	Enlil/ Eli, Clara Scott	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40875419-dark-redemption
