Lord Loss	The Demonata #1	Darren Shan	4.23	20046	1347	The first novel in a chilling new series by Darren Shan, author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series, will keep readers turning page after horrifying page. Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies. He hates history and loves bacon, rats, and playing tricks on his squeamish older sister. When he opts out of a family weekend trip, he never guesses that he is about to take a terrifying journey into darkness. Hungry demons and howling werewolves haunt his waking nightmares... and threaten his life.	224	January 1st 2005	Grubbs Grady, Bill-E Spleen, Dervish Grady, Meera Flame, Lord Loss		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164719.Lord_Loss
