Last of the Dixie Heroes		Peter Abrahams	3.09	119	8	Roy Hill married the girl of his dreams, dotes on his eleven-year-old son, and is next in line for a big promotion in the Atlanta office of a global corporation. Then, almost imperceptibly, it all starts to unravel.

An extraordinary story about the fate of men and women no longer in step with the rhythms of the modern world, as they march back into Southern history to make things right, Last of the Dixie Heroes is an unforgettable novel of suspense.	352	June 5th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1233937.Last_of_the_Dixie_Heroes
