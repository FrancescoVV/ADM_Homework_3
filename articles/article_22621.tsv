Consolation	Salvation #3	Corinne Michaels	4.36	17186	2034	Liam wasn’t supposed to be my happily ever after. He wasn’t even on my radar. He was my husband’s best friend—forbidden. But my husband is dead and I’m alone. I ache for him and I reach for Liam. One night with Liam changed everything. Now I have to decide if I truly love him or if he’s just the consolation prize.	302	March 18th 2015	Liam Dempsey, Natalie Gilcher	Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23270403-consolation
