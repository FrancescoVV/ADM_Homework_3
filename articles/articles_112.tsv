As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote...and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.	659	January 28th 1977	Wendy Torrance, Danny Torrance, Dick Halloran, Horace Derwent, Stuart Ullman, Albert Shockley, Delberg Grady, Watson, Bill Edmonds, Charles Grondin, Sylvia Hunter Derwent, Howard Cottrell, Larry Durkin, Jack Torrance	Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining
