Burn for Burn	Burn for Burn #1	Jenny Han, Siobhan Vivian	3.83	26400	3306	Postcard-perfect Jar Island is home to charming tourist shops, pristine beaches, amazing oceanfront homes—and three girls secretly plotting revenge. KAT is sick and tired of being bullied by her former best friend. LILLIA has always looked out for her little sister, so when she discovers that one of her guy friends has been secretly hooking up with her, she’s going to put a stop to it. MARY is perpetually haunted by a traumatic event from years past, and the boy who’s responsible has yet to get what’s coming to him. None of the girls can act on their revenge fantasies alone without being suspected. But together…anything is possible. With an alliance in place, there will be no more “I wish I’d said…” or “If I could go back and do things differently...” These girls will show Jar Island that revenge is a dish best enjoyed together.	356	September 18th 2012	Mary Zane, Lillia Cho, Kat DeBrassio	Jar Island, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13406425-burn-for-burn
