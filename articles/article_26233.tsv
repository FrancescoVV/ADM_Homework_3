D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Battle for the Normandy Beaches		Stephen E. Ambrose	4.28	23800	712	It is the young men born into the false prosperity of the 1920s and brought up in the bitter realities of the Depression of the 1930s that this book is about. The literature they read as youngsters was anti-war and cynical, portraying patriots as suckers, slackers and heroes. None of them wanted to be part of another war. They wanted to be throwing baseballs, not handgrenades; shooting .22s at rabbits, not M-1s at other young men. But when the test came, when freedom had to be fought for or abandoned, they fought (from the Prologue).	656	June 6th 1994		World War II (WW II), Western Europe, France, Normandy , 1944 (France), Normandy (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49250.D_Day_June_6_1944
