Dragonfly in Amber	Outlander #2	Diana Gabaldon	4.32	288803	14996	From the author of Outlander ... a magnificent epic that once again sweeps us back in time to the drama and passion of 18th-century Scotland... For twenty years Claire Randall has kept her secrets. But now she is returning with her grown daughter to Scotland's majestic mist-shrouded hills. Here Claire plans to reveal a truth as stunning as the events that gave it birth: about the mystery of an ancient circle of standing stones ...about a love that transcends the boundaries of time ...and about James Fraser, a Scottish warrior whose gallantry once drew a young Claire from the security of her century to the dangers of his .... Now a legacy of blood and desire will test her beautiful copper-haired daughter, Brianna, as Claire's spellbinding journey of self-discovery continues in the intrigue-ridden Paris court of Charles Stuart ...in a race to thwart a doomed Highlands uprising ...and in a desperate fight to save both the child and the man she loves....	963	July 1st 1992	Jamie Fraser, Brianna Randall, Roger MacKenzie, Fergus Fraser, Ian Murray, Claire Randall Fraser, Jonathan Randall, Dougal MacKenzie, Colum MacKenzie, Geillis Duncan, Jenny Murray, Frank Randall, Murtagh Fraser	Le Havre (France), Paris (France), Inverness, Scotland, Scottish Highlands , 1745, Scottish Highlands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5364.Dragonfly_in_Amber
