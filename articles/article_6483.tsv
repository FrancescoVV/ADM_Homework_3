Clare also feels compelled to take midnight walks in Ravensmere's abandoned China Garden. Then her mother reveals that their own past is tragically linked to the estate. But when Clare discovers that Ravensmere is in grave danger, will she risk her future-and Mark's-to save it?	288	March 1st 1996	Clare, Mark	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82648.The_China_Garden
