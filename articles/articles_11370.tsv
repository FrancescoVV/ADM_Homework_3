Family Life – A Bridge Between Harmony and Agony		Gheorghe Vîrtosu	4.57	14	12	Family Life – A Bridge Between Harmony and Agony is a novel which skillfully binds together the idyllic and the mundane as two sides of the same coin. The driving force behind this masterful writing is profound sorrow experienced by author Gheorghe Virtosu in his relationship with his older sister, Maria, throughout their childhood. It is the gritty testimony of a child struggling to come to terms with his own feelings and thoughts, with his nearest and dearest, and with the world around. The quest becomes a meaningful and empowering statement of self-belief and self-discovery, as in the end, the sworn-enemy siblings turn out to be the best of friends throughout their teenage and, really, for the rest of their lives. The autobiographical recount gently and seamlessly seeps into fantasy, bringing to the forefront the charming story of a duckling and his family. An unmissable must-read!	206	August 30th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52759512-family-life-a-bridge-between-harmony-and-agony
