Lords and Ladies	Discworld #14	Terry Pratchett	4.16	68736	1565	A Discworld Novel. It's a hot Midsummer Night. The crop circles are turning up everywhere-even on the mustard-and-cress of Pewseyy Ogg, aged four. And Magrat Garlick, witch, is going to be married in the morning...Everything ought to be going like a dream. But the Lancre All-Comers Morris Team have got drunk on a fairy mound and the elves have come back, bringing all those things traditionally associated with the magical, glittering realm of Faerie: cruelty, kidnapping, malice and evil, evil murder.* Granny Weatherwax and her tiny argumentative coven have really got their work cut out this time...With full supporting cast of dwarfs, wizards, trolls, Morris Dancers and one orang-utan. And lots. of hey-nonny-nonny and blood all over the place. *But with tons of style.	400	November 1992	The Them, Nanny Ogg, DEATH, Magrat Garlick, Verence the Fool, Agnes Nitt, The Librarian, Mustrum Ridcully, Ponder Stibbons, Greebo the Cat, Diamanda Tockley, Shawn Ogg, Jason Ogg, Casanunda, Hwel, Granny Weatherwax	Discworld	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34529.Lords_and_Ladies
