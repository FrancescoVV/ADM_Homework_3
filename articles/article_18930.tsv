Embers of Atlanta: A short story		Lauren»õiu M. Badea	4.45	11	6	Dreams of lost past, a boy on the run, a man trying to make peace with his mistakes. Destinies intertwine in three mind-bending stories revolving around a single destructive factor, all converging in one concluding moment. They are embers, fallen from a great fire; some fade, some create conflagrations, and Atlanta burns around them.	42	May 17th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35168797-embers-of-atlanta
