Prince Lestat	The Vampire Chronicles #11	Anne Rice	3.80	20385	2484	The vampire world is in crisis – their kind have been proliferating out of control and, thanks to technologies undreamed of in previous centuries, they can communicate as never before. Roused from their earth-bound slumber, ancient ones are in thrall to the Voice: which commands that they burn fledgling vampires in cities from Paris to Mumbai, Hong Kong to Kyoto and San Francisco. Immolation, huge massacres, have commenced all over the world. Who – or what – is the Voice? What does it desire, and why? There is only one vampire, only one blood drinker, truly known to the entire world of the Undead. Will the dazzling hero-wanderer, the dangerous rebel-outlaw Lestat heed the call to unite the Children of Darkness as they face this new twilight? Anne Rice’s epic, luxuriant, fiercely ambitious new novel brings together all the worlds and beings of the legendary Vampire Chronicles, from present-day New York and Ancient Egypt to fourth-century Carthage and Renaissance Venice; from Louis de Pointe du Lac; Armand the eternally young; Mekare and Maharet; to Pandora and Flavius; David Talbot, vampire and ultimate fixer from the Secret Talamasca; and Marius, the true child of the Millennia. It also introduces many other seductive supernatural creatures, and heralds significant new blood.	458	October 28th 2014	Lestat de Lioncourt, Gabrielle de Lioncourt, Jesse Miriam Reeves, Marius de Romanus, David Talbot, Bianca Solderini, Louis de Pointe du Lac, Rhoshamandes, Benji Mahmoud, Amel, Dr. Fareed Bhansali, Allesandra, Gregory Duff Collingsworth, Gremt Stryker Knollys, Sevraine, Armand, Pandora, Maharet, Khayman, Mekare, Teskhamen, Avicus, Chrysanthe, Cyril, Flannery Gilman, Hesketh, Notker the Wise, Raymond Gallant, Rose de Lioncourt, Seth (VC), Viktor de Lioncourt, Arjun		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21412673-prince-lestat
