Cleo Can Tie A Bow: A Rabbit and Fox Story		Sybrina Durant, Pumudi Gardiyawasam	4.31	383	23	Cleo loves bows. She wears her hair in a bow and decorates her room with bows. Cleo is bow crazy. Learning to tie a bow is very difficult for some people but Cleo remembers how to do it from a cute story she once heard. It is about a little rabbit with very long ears and a very helpful fox who shows her what to do to keep them clean. This is the story of how Cleo learns to tie a “bunny ear” bow. Exercises in manual dexterity build self-esteem in children. Knowing how to tie shoe-strings, scarves and more into a bow is a useful and rewarding skill. “Teach a child a useful skill. Build confidence and self-esteem that lasts a lifetime.”	38	September 23rd 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55463003-cleo-can-tie-a-bow
