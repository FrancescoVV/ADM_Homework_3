The Liquidator		Iain Parke	3.85	55	9	Dangerous things happen in Africa. People disappear. Everybody knows that. But as an outsider, Paul thinks he is safe, even from the secret police, whatever he starts to find, or wherever it leads; despite the turmoil leading up to the country’s first multi party election and with a diamond fuelled civil war raging in the failed state just across the border. But when Paul finds himself and his friends trapped holding a potentially deadly secret as the country begins to implode, what will he be prepared to do to protect himself and those around him in order to escape? Iain’s first novel, The Liquidator, is a contemporary political mystery / black comedy that asks, when the chips are down, what would you do if you felt threatened enough in an alien situation?	284	September 24th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9478000-the-liquidator
