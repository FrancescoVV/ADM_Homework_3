I Surrender	I Surrender #1	Monica  James	3.97	1383	201	Singapore has stolen a piece of Ava Thompson. It took one life shattering moment for her to realize her ex-boyfriend is not the man she believed him to be. Returning home to Los Angeles was never going to be easy for Ava, as her heart has been shattered to smithereens and she’s convinced it’ll never heal. Or, so she thought. Enter Jasper White. Unbeknown to Ava, he will change her life forever. The attraction is instantaneous, which troubles Ava, who has sworn off men indefinitely. Yet, she is finding resisting Jasper—with his tousled bedroom hair and piercing cerulean eyes—harder than she ever imagined. That’s because Jasper knows what he wants … and he wants her. Can Ava surrender to her feelings for the one man who compels her to love again? What happens if love isn’t enough?	492	July 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28665243-i-surrender
