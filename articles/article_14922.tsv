Sasha has returned to the forest to raise her kits, Moth, Hawk, and Tadpole, but Tigerstar still haunts her dreams. She thinks she's a safe distance from ShadowClan's prying eyes, but Sasha fears that Tigerstar will soon discover the existence of his kits. As leaf-bare stretches on and Sasha finds it harder to feed her family, she wonders if her kits might be better off as warriors, with a Clan to protect and train them.
