Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead		Olga Tokarczuk, Antonia Lloyd-Jones	3.96	32126	4309	WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE In a remote Polish village, Janina devotes the dark winter days to studying astrology, translating the poetry of William Blake, and taking care of the summer homes of wealthy Warsaw residents. Her reputation as a crank and a recluse is amplified by her not-so-secret preference for the company of animals over humans. Then a neighbor, Big Foot, turns up dead. Soon other bodies are discovered, in increasingly strange circumstances. As suspicions mount, Janina inserts herself into the investigation, certain that she knows whodunit. If only anyone would pay her mind... A deeply satisfying thriller cum fairy tale, Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is a provocative exploration of the murky borderland between sanity and madness, justice and tradition, autonomy and fate. Whom do we deem sane? it asks. Who is worthy of a voice?	274	November 25th 2009		Plaskowyż (Poland), Kłodzko (Poland), Wrocław (Poland), Poland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42983724-drive-your-plow-over-the-bones-of-the-dead
