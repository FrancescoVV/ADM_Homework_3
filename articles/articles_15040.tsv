Deenie		Judy Blume	3.78	13870	751	When Deenie finds out that she has scoliosis, she’s scared. When she sees the brace for the first time, she wants to scream. But the words won't come out. And Deenie, beautiful Deenie, who everyone says should be a model, is stuck wearing a brace from her neck to her hips. For four years—or longer. She never worried about how she looked before—how will she ever face the hard times ahead?	159	1973	Deenie, Buddy Brader	New Jersey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37735.Deenie
