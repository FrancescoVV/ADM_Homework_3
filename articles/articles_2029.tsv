The Gift of the Magi		O. Henry, Lisbeth Zwerger	4.09	82688	1873	One dollar and eighty-seven cents is all the money Della has in the world to buy her beloved a Christmas present. She has nothing to sell except her only treasure--her long, beautiful brown hair. Set in New York at the turn of the twentieth century, this classic piece of American literature tells the story of a young couple and the sacrifices each must make to buy the other a gift. Beautiful, delicate watercolors by award-winning illustrator Lisbeth Zwerger add new poignancy and charm to this simple tale about the rewards of unselfish love.	26	December 10th 1905	Jim, Della	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143534.The_Gift_of_the_Magi
