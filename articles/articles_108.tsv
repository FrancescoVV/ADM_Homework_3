Middlesex		Jeffrey Eugenides	4.01	582702	23216	Middlesex tells the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides, and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family, who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City and the race riots of 1967 before moving out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Pointe, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret, and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, Middlesex is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.	529	September 4th 2002	Calliope Stephanides, Eleutherios Stephanides, Desdemona Stephanides, Sourmelina Zizmo, Miltiades Stephanides, Theodora Stephanides, Chapter Eleven, The Obscure Object, James Zizmo, Michael Antoniou	Bursa (Turkey), Izmir (Turkey), Detroit, Michigan (United States), Berlin (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2187.Middlesex
