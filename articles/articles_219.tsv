The Trial		Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Willa Muir, Edwin Muir	3.96	236115	7662	Written in 1914 but not published until 1925, a year after Kafka’s death, The Trial is the terrifying tale of Josef K., a respectable bank officer who is suddenly and inexplicably arrested and must defend himself against a charge about which he can get no information. Whether read as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy of the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of totalitarianism, The Trial has resonated with chilling truth for generations of readers.	255	1925	Josef K, Fräulein Elsa, Fräulein Bürstner, Karl K., Herr Huld, Rudi Block, Frau Grubach, Leni, Titorelli, Franz, Willem, Albert K., Erna K.		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17690.The_Trial
