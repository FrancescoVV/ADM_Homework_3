The Lottery and Other Stories		Shirley Jackson	4.06	63958	2387	The Lottery , one of the most terrifying stories written in this century, created a sensation when it was first published in The New Yorker . "Power and haunting," and "nights of unrest" were typical reader responses. This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites "The Lottery:" with twenty-four equally unusual stories. Together they demonstrate Jackson's remarkable range--from the hilarious to the truly horrible--and power as a storyteller.	302	1949			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89723.The_Lottery_and_Other_Stories
