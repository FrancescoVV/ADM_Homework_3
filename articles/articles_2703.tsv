Hunting Ground	Alpha & Omega #2	Patricia Briggs	4.27	60394	2194	Anna Latham didn’t know how complicated life could be until she became a werewolf. And until she was mated to Charles Cornick, the son — and enforcer — of Bran, the leader of the North American werewolves, she didn’t know how dangerous it could be either... Anna and Charles have just been enlisted to attend a summit to present Bran’s controversial proposition: that the wolves should finally reveal themselves to humans. But the most feared Alpha in Europe is dead set against the plan — and it seems like someone else might be too. When Anna is attacked by vampires using pack magic, the kind of power only werewolves should be able to draw on, Charles and Anna must combine their talents to hunt down whoever is behind it all — or risk losing everything...	286	August 25th 2009	Samuel Cornick, Charles Cornick, Anna Latham, Asil "The Moor" (Hussan), Dana Shea, Arthur Madden, Sunny Madden, Jean Chastel, Heinrich Postinger, Bran "The Marrok" Cornick	Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5292853-hunting-ground
