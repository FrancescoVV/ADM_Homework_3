Three Tales		Gustave Flaubert, Roger Whitehouse, Geoffrey Wall	3.68	5267	332	First published in 1877, these three stories are dominated by questions of doubt, love, loneliness, and religious experience; together they confirm Flaubert as a master of the short story. A Simple Heart (also published as A Simple Soul ), relates the story of Félicité, an uneducated serving-woman who retains her Catholic faith despite a life of desolation and loss. The Legend of Saint Julian Hospitator , inspired by a stained-glass window in Rouen cathedral, describes the fate of a sadistic hunter destined to murder his own parents. The blend of faith and cruelty that dominates this story may also be found in Herodias , a reworking of the tale of Salome and John the Baptist.	110	April 1877			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2182.Three_Tales
