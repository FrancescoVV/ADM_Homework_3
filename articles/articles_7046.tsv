Ultraviolet	Ultraviolet #1	R.J. Anderson	3.75	9183	1532	Once upon a time there was a girl who was special. This is not her story. Unless you count the part where I killed her. Sixteen-year-old Alison has been sectioned in a mental institute for teens, having murdered the most perfect and popular girl at school. But the case is a mystery: no body has been found, and Alison's condition is proving difficult to diagnose. Alison herself can't explain what happened: one minute she was fighting with Tori -- the next she disintegrated. Into nothing. But that's impossible. Right? When Alison meets Dr Faraday, a visiting psychologist, she feels an instant connection. More, he believes her story.
