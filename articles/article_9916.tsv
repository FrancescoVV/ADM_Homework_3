Time and Chance	Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine #2	Sharon Kay Penman	4.29	7826	357	In When Christ and His Saints Slept , acclaimed historical novelist Sharon Kay Penman portrayed all the deceit, danger, and drama of Henry II's ascension to the throne. Now, in Time and Chance, she continues the ever-more-captivating tale. It was medieval England's immortal marriage--Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II, bound by passion and ambition, certain to leave a legacy of greatness. But while lust would divide them, it was friendship--and ultimately faith--that brought bloodshed into their midst. It began with Thomas Becket, Henry's closest confidant, and his elevation to be Archbishop of Canterbury. It ended with a perceived betrayal that made a royal murder seem inevitable. Along the way were enough scheming, seductions, and scandals to topple any kingdom but their own. . . . Only Sharon Kay Penman can re-create this truly tumultuous time--and capture the couple who loved power as much as each other . . . and a man who loved God most of all.	544	March 4th 2002	Thomas Becket, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry II of England, Empress Matilda, Henry the Young King, William Marshal	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234560.Time_and_Chance
