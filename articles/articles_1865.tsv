Fire Study	Poison Study #3	Maria V. Snyder	3.91	57410	3875	The apprenticeship is over—now the real test has begun. When word that Yelena is a Soulfinder—able to capture and release souls—spreads like wildfire, people grow uneasy. Already Yelena's unusual abilities and past have set her apart. As the Council debates Yelena's fate, she receives a disturbing message: a plot is rising against her homeland, led by a murderous sorcerer she has defeated before... Honor sets Yelena on a path that will test the limits of her skills, and the hope of reuniting with her beloved spurs her onward. Her journey is fraught with allies, enemies, lovers and would-be assassins, each of questionable loyalty. Yelena will have but one chance to prove herself—and save the land she holds dear.	441	February 26th 2008	Valek, Commander Ambrose, Irys Jewelrose, Cahill Ixia, Moon Man, Leif Zaltana, Janco, Opal Cowan, Yelena Zaltana, Ari, Roze Featherstone, Tauno, Captain Marrok	Sitia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1966969.Fire_Study
