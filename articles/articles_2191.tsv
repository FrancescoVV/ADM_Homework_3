The Slippery Slope	A Series of Unfortunate Events #10	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	4.02	105994	2533	Dear Reader, Like handshakes, house pets, or raw carrots, many things are preferable when not slippery. Unfortunately, in this miserable volume, I am afraid that Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire run into more than their fair share of slipperiness during their harrowing journey up--and down--a range of strange and distressing mountains. In order to spare you any further repulsion, it would be best not to mention any of the unpleasant details of this story, particularly a secret message, a toboggan, a deceitful map, a swarm of snow gnats, a scheming villain, a troupe of organized youngsters, a covered casserole dish, and a surprising survivor of a terrible fire. Unfortunately, I have dedicated my life to researching and recording the sad tale of the Baudelaire orphans. There is no reason for you to dedicate your-self to such things, and you might instead dedicate yourself to letting this slippery book slip from your hands into a nearby trash receptacle, or deep pit. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket	337	September 23rd 2003	Count Olaf, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Violet Baudelaire, Esm√© Squalor, Quigley Quagmire, Carmelita Spats	Mortmain Mountains	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297792.The_Slippery_Slope
