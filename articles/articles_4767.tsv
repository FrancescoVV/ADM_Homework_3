The Replacement		Brenna Yovanoff	3.55	19113	2798	Mackie Doyle is not one of us. Though he lives in the small town of Gentry, he comes from a world of tunnels and black murky water, a world of living dead girls ruled by a little tattooed princess. He is a Replacement, left in the crib of a human baby sixteen years ago. Now, because of fatal allergies to iron, blood, and consecrated ground, Mackie is fighting to survive in the human world. Mackie would give anything to live among us, to practice on his bass or spend time with his crush, Tate. But when Tate's baby sister goes missing, Mackie is drawn irrevocably into the underworld of Gentry, known as Mayhem. He must face the dark creatures of the Slag Heaps and find his rightful place, in our world, or theirs.	343	September 21st 2010	Tate Stewart, Roswell Reed, Mackie Doyle, The Morrigan, Emma Doyle	Gentry, Arkansas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507908-the-replacement
