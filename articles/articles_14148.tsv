A Fine and Private Place		Peter S. Beagle	3.99	3530	366	This classic tale from the author of The Last Unicorn is a journey between the realms of the living and the dead, and a testament to the eternal power of love. Michael Morgan was not ready to die, but his funeral was carried out just the same. Trapped in the dark limbo between life and death as a ghost, he searches for an escape. Instead, he discovers the beautiful Laura...and a love stronger than the boundaries of the grave and the spirit world.	304	1960		New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76718.A_Fine_and_Private_Place
