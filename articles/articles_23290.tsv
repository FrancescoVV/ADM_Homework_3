Others yell. There is anger in these pages, as well as love. There is clarity, as well as confusion. And there is hope. Hope that things can sometimes be fixed. Hope that eventually high school will end, Hope that a new generation of writers can use their quiet and their noise to make an undeniable mark. Listen to what they have to say -- and see what they can do.	368	July 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3699512-we-are-quiet-we-are-loud
