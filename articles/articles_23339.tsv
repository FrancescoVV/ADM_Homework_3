Short Stories of Twisted Tales		Robin Renee Ray	4.55	11	2	Fear – unbridled, unadulterated, unavoidable. It is the force that drives the best of us. For most, the fear is totally irrational. For the unfortunate people trapped in these stories, however, the fear is so terrifying, so undeniably twisted that none can escape… not even you.	336	September 14th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9895634-short-stories-of-twisted-tales
