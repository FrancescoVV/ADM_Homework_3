The Compleat Works of Wllm Shkspr (abridged)		Reduced Shakespeare Company, Adam Long, Daniel Singer, Jess Winfield	4.44	8447	131	Revised from the rather long original complete works of Shakespeare, this abridged version is written by three Americans, with no qualifications worth speaking of. The playtext is reproduced here with footnotes which will be of no help to anyone and a letter from the authors to the Queen.	137	February 1st 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1423.The_Compleat_Works_of_Wllm_Shkspr
