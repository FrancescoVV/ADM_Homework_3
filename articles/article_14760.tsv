The Legacy	The Declaration #3	Gemma Malley	3.81	4264	303	When a Pincent Pharma lorry is ambushed by underground activists, its contents come as a huge surprise - not drugs, but decomposing corpses. It appears Longevity isn't working and the drugs promising eternal youth are failing. A virus is sweeping the country, killing in its wake, and Longevity is powerless to fight it.	272	September 6th 2010	Anna Covey, Peter Tomlinsin		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7320458-the-legacy
