The Blood Lure	The Hidden Land #1	Peter     Meredith	4.20	50	20	Ella Belmont is a normal girl to those who don't look too close. To those with a keener eye it's obvious that she's a step apartâ€”a step above. She has an easy grace, a natural beauty, and a serenity of the soul that isn't at all common in modern America. Ella is different and purposefully so, she just doesn't realize it. Nor does she realize that she is in fact a pawn in a deadly, magical game where lives and hidden kingdoms hang in the balance and the question on everyone's lips is not who is she, but what is she? To be precise, she is bait.	300	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17878054-the-blood-lure
