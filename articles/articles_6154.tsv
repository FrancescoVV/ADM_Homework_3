Dark Challenge	Dark #5	Christine Feehan	4.25	21306	459	WAS SHE MORE THAN HIS MATE? Julian Savage was golden. Powerful. But tormented. For the brooding hunter walked alone, always alone, far from his Carpathian kind, alien to even his twin. Like his name, his existence was savage. Until he met the woman he was sworn to protect... When Julian heard Desari sing, rainbows swamped his starving senses. Emotions bombarded his hardened heart. And a dark hunger to possess her flooded his loins, blinding him to the danger stalking him. And even as Desari enflamed him, she dared to defy him with mysterious, unparalleled feminine powers. Was Desari more than his perfect mate? Julian had met his match in this woman, but would she drive him to madness... or save his soul?	390	November 27th 2000	Julian Savage, Desari Daratrazanoff, Dayan, Darius Daratrazanoff, Syndil, Barack (Dark Carpathians), Savon, Bernardo (Dark Challenge), Renaldo (Dark Challenge)	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313256.Dark_Challenge
