Now You See Me	Lacey Flint #1	Sharon J. Bolton	4.02	19956	1751	One night after interviewing a reluctant witness at a London apartment complex, Lacey Flint, a young detective constable, stumbles onto a woman brutally stabbed just moments before in the building’s darkened parking lot. Within twenty-four hours a reporter receives an anonymous letter that points out alarming similarities between the murder and Jack the Ripper’s first murder—a letter that calls out Lacey by name. If it’s real, and they have a killer bent on re-creating London’s bloody past, history shows they have just five days until the next attempt. No one believes the connections are anything more than a sadistic killer’s game, not even Lacey, whom the killer seems to be taunting specifically. However, as they investigate the details of the case start reminding her more and more of a part of her past she’d rather keep hidden. And the only way to do that is to catch the killer herself.	400	May 26th 2011	Lacey Flint, Detective Inspector Dana Tulloch, Mark Joesbury	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9783200-now-you-see-me
