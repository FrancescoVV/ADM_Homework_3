The Deptford Trilogy: Fifth Business/The Manticore/World of Wonders	The Deptford Trilogy #1â€“3	Robertson Davies	4.32	7646	377	Who killed Boy Staunton? Around this central mystery is woven a glittering, fantastical, cunningly contrived trilogy of novels. Luring the reader down labyrinthine tunnels of myth, history, and magic, The Deptford Trilogy provides an exhilarating antidote to a world from where "the fear and dread and splendour of wonder have been banished."	874	1975			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74403.The_Deptford_Trilogy
