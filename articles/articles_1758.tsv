First Drop of Crimson	Night Huntress World #1	Jeaniene Frost	4.14	53258	2398	The night is not safe for mortals. Denise MacGregor knows all too well what lurks in the shadows – her best friend is half-vampire Cat Crawfield – and she has already lost more than the average human could bear. But her family’s dark past is wrapped in secrets and shrouded in darkness – and a demon shapeshifter has marked Denise as prey. Now her survival depends on an immortal who craves a taste of her. He is Spade, a powerful, mysterious vampire who has walked the earth for centuries and is now duty-bound to protect this endangered, alluring human – even if it means destroying his own kind. Denise may arouse his deepest hungers, but Spade knows he must fight his urge to have her as they face the demon nightmare together… Because once the first drop of crimson falls, they will both be lost.	371	January 27th 2010	Denise MacGregor, Bones (Night Huntress series), Catherine Crawfield-Russell, Spade (Night Huntress series), Mencheres, Ian Flannery	Fort Worth, Texas (United States), St. Louis, Missouri (United States), New York City, New York (United States), Durham, England Las Vegas, Nevada (United States) Monaco Bucharest (Romania), Durham, England, Las Vegas, Nevada (United States), Monaco, Bucharest (Romania)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6547187-first-drop-of-crimson
