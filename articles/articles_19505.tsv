The Ending I Want		Samantha Towle	4.23	4376	491	From the New York Times Bestselling author of The Mighty Storm, comes a heartfelt new standalone novel... Taylor Shaw had the perfect life—until she was sixteen. That was when everything changed. From that moment on, life went from bad to worse…to the worst. After recovering from a brain tumor, months later, she suffers the tragic loss of her whole family. Since that fateful day, she’s been coasting through life. Now, the brain tumor has returned, and Taylor decides she’s had enough. She’s going to take her fate into her own hands. No more hospitals. No more surgeries. No more anything. She’s going to join her family. It’s her decision. What she longs for. The ending she wants. She just has a list of things to do before she goes. First, go to England. Second, kiss a stranger… Only, Taylor didn’t expect Liam Hunter, the stranger—with his handsome face, his six-foot-three of gorgeousness, and his oh-so-hot English accent—to change things. To change her. To change the ending she wanted. What is a girl, who is standing on the edge of nothing, to do when offered the chance of everything?	467	May 8th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30139492-the-ending-i-want
