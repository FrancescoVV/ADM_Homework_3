Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography		Roland Barthes, Richard Howard	3.98	46904	649	A graceful, contemplative volume, Camera Lucida was first published in 1979. Commenting on artists such as Avedon, Clifford, Mapplethorpe, and Nadar, Roland Barthes presents photography as being outside the codes of language or culture, acting on the body as much as on the mind, and rendering death and loss more acutely than any other medium. This groundbreaking approach established Camera Lucida as one of the most important books of theory on this subject, along with Susan Sontag's On Photography .	119	February 21st 1980			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/497164.Camera_Lucida
