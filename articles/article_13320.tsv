Out of the Deep I Cry	The Rev. Clare Fergusson & Russ Van Alstyne Mysteries #3	Julia Spencer-Fleming	4.14	5922	495	On April 1, 1930, Jonathan Ketchem's wife Jane walked from her house to the police department to ask for help in finding her husband. The men, worn out from a night of chasing bootleggers, did what they could. But no one ever saw Jonathan Ketchem again... Now decades later, someone else is missing in Miller's Kill, NY. This time it's the physician of the clinic that bears the Ketchem name. Suspicion falls on a volatile single mother with a grudge against the doctor, but Reverend Clare Fergusson isn't convinced. As Clare and Russ investigate, they discover that the doctor's disappearance is linked to a bloody trail going all the way back to the hardscrabble Prohibition era. As they draw ever closer to the truth, their attraction for each other grows increasingly more difficult to resist. And their search threatens to uncover secrets that snake from one generation to the next--and to someone who's ready to kill. Julia Spencer-Fleming has created the most intriguing entry yet in her Anthony, Agatha and Macavity Award-winning detective series, which "brings new airs and graces to the traditional small-town mystery" ( New York Times Book Review ). Out of the Deep I Cry is a 2005 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel.	399	April 26th 2004	Russ Van Alstyne, Clare Fergusson, Jonathan Ketcham, Jane Ketcham, Anne Ellis, Norman Madsen, Lacy Marshall, Allen Rouse, Renee Rouse, Officer Kevin Flynn, Deborah "Deba" Claugh, Laura Rayfield, Willam Ellis, Robert Corlew, Sterling Sumner, Terrance "Terry" McClellan, Geoffrey "Jeff" Burns, Karen Burns, Hugh Pottiger, Mr. Hadley, Roxanne Lunt, Neil Madsen, Linda Van Allstyne, Yvonne Story, Lyle McCauley, Haflene Lender, Margie Van Alstyne	Millers Kill, New York (United States), Adirondack Mountains, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138097.Out_of_the_Deep_I_Cry
