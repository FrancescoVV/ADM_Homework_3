A Canticle for Leibowitz	St. Leibowitz #1	Walter M. Miller Jr., Mary Doria Russell	3.97	94143	4776	In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes.	334	October 1959	Isaac Edward Leibowitz, Benjamin Eleazar bar Joshua		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164154.A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz
