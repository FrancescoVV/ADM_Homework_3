Teen Roach		La Tisha Honor	5.00	2	1	Who would've thought the savior of all animal species would be a cockroach? It's the year 2050, and roaches have evolved into an anthropomorphic species. They have arms and legs. They can think rationally, raise families, and run businesses. In Teen Roach, Rylee, a teenage anthropomorphic roach lives with her family in Cookieville, a community of roaches lodged in Mr. Applehead’s basement. But when the maniacal Lord Chaos and the Exterminators threaten to kill off every roach in the world, Rylee must make a decision to succumb to their stupid ideals—or stop them. Will she succeed in saving the day? She’s just a kid, after all.		2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30839886-teen-roach
