100 Love Sonnets		Pablo Neruda, Stephen Tapscott	4.39	14798	608	Against the backdrop of Isla Negra - the sea and wind, the white sand with its scattering of delicate wild flowers, the hot sun and salty smells of the Pacific - the poet sets the poems in celebration of his love. The subject of that love is Matilde Urrutia de Neruda, Pablo's 'beloved wife'.	232	1959			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11339.100_Love_Sonnets
