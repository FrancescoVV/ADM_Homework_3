Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing	Fudge #1	Judy Blume	4.10	131955	2783	Life with his little brother, Fudge, makes Peter Hatcher feel like a fourth grade nothing. Whether Fudge is throwing a temper tantrum in a shoe store, smearing mashed potatoes on the walls at Hamburger Heaven, or trying to fly, he's never far from trouble. He's an almost three-year-old terror who gets away with everything, and Peter's had it up to here! When Fudge walks off with Dribble, Peter's pet turtle, it's the last straw. Peter has put up with Fudge for too long. Way too long! How can he get his parents to pay attention to him for a change?	144	1972	Fudge Hatcher, Sheila Tubman, Peter Hatcher, Jimmy Fargo	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37741.Tales_of_a_Fourth_Grade_Nothing
