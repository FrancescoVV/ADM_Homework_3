Big Mushy Happy Lump	Sarah's Scribbles #2	Sarah Andersen	4.27	20305	2752	Sarah Andersen's second comics collection picks up right where the first left off - huddled under a pile of blankets avoiding the responsibilities of the real world. These new comics (and illustrated personal essays!) follow the ups and downs of the unrelenting self-esteem roller coaster that is young adult life: budgeting woes, cramps, the nuances of sweater theft, and the joy of staying home all day with a box of pizza. All aboard.	128	March 7th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30754980-big-mushy-happy-lump
