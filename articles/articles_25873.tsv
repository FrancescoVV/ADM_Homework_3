The Silk Roads: A New History of the World		Peter Frankopan	4.22	20385	2224	For centuries, fame and fortune were to be found in the west â€“ in the New World of the Americas. Today, it is the east which calls out to those in search of riches and adventure. Sweeping right across Central Asia and deep into China and India, a region that once took centre stage is again rising to dominate global politics, commerce and culture. A major reassessment of world history, The Silk Roads is a dazzling exploration of the forces that have driven the rise and fall of empires, determined the flow of ideas and goods and are now heralding a new dawn in international affairs.	636	August 27th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25812847-the-silk-roads
