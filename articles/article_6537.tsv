Arsen: A Broken Love Story		Mia Asher, MacKenzie Cartwright, Roger Wayne	4.16	15800	2847	One glance was all it took… I'm a cheater. I'm a liar. My whole life is a mess. I love a man. No, I love two men… I think. One makes love to me. The other sets me on fire. One is my rock. The other is my kryptonite. I'm broken, lost, and disgusted with myself. But I can't stop. This is my story. My broken love story.	484	August 23rd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17999935-arsen
