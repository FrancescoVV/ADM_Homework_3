Urban Shaman	Walker Papers #1	C.E. Murphy	3.73	14280	811	Joanne Walker has three days to learn to use her shamanic powers and save the world from the unleashed Wild Hunt. No worries. No pressure. Never mind the lack of sleep, the perplexing new talent for healing from fatal wounds, or the cryptic, talking coyote who appears in her dreams. And if all that's not bad enough, in the three years Joanne's been a cop, she's never seen a dead body -- but she's just come across her second in three days. It's been a bitch of a week. And it isn't over yet.	410	May 31st 2005	Joanne Walker, Gary, Coyote, Cernunnos	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297929.Urban_Shaman
