The Temptation of St. Antony		Gustave Flaubert, Lafcadio Hearn, Kitty Mrosovsky	3.82	2620	132	A book that deeply influenced the young Freud and was the inspiration for many artists, The Temptation of Saint Anthony was Flaubert's lifelong work, thirty years in the making. Based on the story of the third-century saint who lived on an isolated mountaintop in the Egyptian desert, it is a fantastical rendering of one night during which Anthony is besieged by carnal temptations and philosophical doubt.	304	1874	Saint Antony of Egypt, Ammonaria, King Nebuchadnezzar, The Queen of Sheba	Egypt	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355034.The_Temptation_of_St_Antony
