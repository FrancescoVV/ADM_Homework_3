Run		Ann Patchett	3.58	39524	4908	Set over a period of twenty-four hours, Run shows us how worlds of privilege and poverty can coexist only blocks apart from each other, and how family can include people you've never even met. Since their mother's death, Tip and Teddy Doyle have been raised by their loving, possessive, and ambitious father. As the former mayor of Boston, Bernard Doyle wants to see his sons in politics, a dream the boys have never shared. But when an argument in a blinding New England snowstorm inadvertently causes an accident that involves a stranger and her child, all Bernard Doyle cares about is his ability to keep his children—all his children—safe.	295	2007	Bernadette, Doyle, Sullivan, Teddy Hall, Tennessee, Kenya, Tip	Boston, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80566.Run
