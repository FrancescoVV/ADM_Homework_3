Fifteen - When Boys Become Men		Fraser Smillie	5.00	3	0	Fifteen is a story about four fifteen year old boys from very different walks of life that are the best of friends. Just as the boys are getting ready for the last big school summer holidays, they discover a cookbook with recipes from making homemade fireworks, and mild drugs, to plastic explosives and LSD. These experiments along with the over consumption of alcohol, give some great laughs, but the main story focuses on the friendship that exists between them. This book is dedicated to Torquil Cowan. The man that selflessly gave so much of his time to help me with my writing.	139	January 3rd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21220669-fifteen---when-boys-become-men
