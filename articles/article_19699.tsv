Across the Face of the World	Fire of Heaven #1	Russell Kirkpatrick	3.26	1269	131	From the tiny snowbound village of Loulea, five men and women are about to embark on a journey that will change their lives - and the destiny of their world. For two thousand years, Kannwar, the immortal Destroyer, has been planning revenge on the Most High. Cast out from Dona Mihst when he drank from the forbidden fountain of eternal life, his plans of vengeance are now nearing fruition - and he will allow nothing to stand in his way. When the trader Mahnum escapes the Destroyer's prison, the Lords of Fear are sent in pursuit. Mahnum makes his way home to Loulea, but there he and his wife are captured. His sons, Leith and Hal, together with a small group of villagers, set off on a quest to free Mahnum and Indrett - and warn their world of the coming war.	554	2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1057502.Across_the_Face_of_the_World
