The Mystery of Humanity		Sadegh Angha, Salaheddin Ali Nader Shah Angha	4.67	12	0	The human quest for tranquility and survival is often found in an "inward vision" and the heart's "discovery" that lead to knowing God. This traditional search for mystical truth, known as irfan, comes to life in The Myustery of Humanity. This book explores irfan and enlightens modern readers to the creation, existence, and eternity of human beings. It contains three texts: Nirvan, Message from the Soul, and Psalm of the Gods, all translated from the Persian. The Mystery of Humanity will impart to readers a thorough knowledge of irfan and an acquaintance of those persons who have indeed attained this higher state of existence.	108	January 28th 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115037.The_Mystery_of_Humanity
