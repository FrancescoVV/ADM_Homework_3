The Meeting	Trench Coats #1	Seeley James	4.30	47	17	In the first episode, Pia Sabel, heroine of The Geneva Decision , is hot on the trail of abducted children when a powerful bureaucrat steps in, threatening to slow her down. But she was there—she saw the heinous crimes—and will let nothing stop her. A few months earlier, she took the helm of her father’s security company and nearly lost her life. She spent the summer improving her skills and learning the business. But when a shadowy group tries to setup her murder, she senses an international conspiracy and begins mapping out the players. Her adversaries think she’s just a spoiled rich kid, a washed up soccer star who’s in over her head. She uses their mistake to her advantage, but who is she really up against—child traffickers or governments?	57	May 12th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17927412-the-meeting
