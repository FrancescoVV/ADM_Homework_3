Caught in the Light		Robert Goddard	3.93	1531	117	On assignment in Vienna, photographer Ian Jarrett falls desperately in love with a woman he meets by chance, Marian Esguard. Back in England, he breaks up with his wife and goes to meet Marian at an agreed rendezvous. Marian fails to show. Searching desperately for her, he stumbles on a Dorset churchyard full of the gravestones of dead Esguards. He also meets a psychotherapist, Daphne Sanger. She too is looking for someone: a former patient who has come to believe she is the reincarnation of Marion Esguard, who lived in Regency times and, it emerges, may have invented photography ten years before Fox Talbot. But if so, why is she unknown to history? And where is the woman he met in Vienna? Ian sets out to solve a mystery that may be 170 years old. At the end of his search a trap awaits him.	448	January 1st 1998		Vienna (Austria), Dorset, England, Chichester, England (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom) Hounslow, London, England (United Kingdom) Barnes, London, England (United Kingdom) Sussex, England (United Kingdom) Iceland Norfolk, England, London, England (United Kingdom), Hounslow, London, England (United Kingdom), Barnes, London, England (United Kingdom), Sussex, England (United Kingdom), Iceland, Norfolk, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/924497.Caught_in_the_Light
