Falling Down	Rockstar #1	Anne Mercier	4.02	6748	567	Falling Down — world famous rock band and my current state of being. My head and my heart have been falling for Jesse Kingston since I was just a schoolgirl. He’s sinfully sexy, and I get to spend my days flirting and dancing in his new music video. The chemistry between us is explosive, but it’s just work—that is, until he proposes a weekend together. I’m all for a sex-filled romp with the dirty-talking rockstar. But what starts out as fun and games turns into something bigger than either of us bargained for. Now he wants more. He wants everything, and he’s not taking no for an answer. Can a schoolgirl crush turn into a happily ever after or am I destined for heartbreak?	351	September 2nd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38922824-falling-down
