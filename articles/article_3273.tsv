The Soft Machine	The Nova Trilogy #1	William S. Burroughs	3.36	6770	283	In Naked Lunch, William S. Burroughs revealed his genius. In The Soft Machine he begins an adventure that will take us even further into the dark recesses of his imagination, a region where nothing is sacred, nothing taboo. Continuing his ferocious verbal assault on hatred, hype, poverty, war, bureaucracy, and addiction in all its forms, Burroughs gives us a surreal space odyssey through the wounded galaxies in a book only he could create.	184	1961			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23937.The_Soft_Machine
