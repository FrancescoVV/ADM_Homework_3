The Trick is to Keep Breathing		Janice Galloway	3.84	2326	193	Janice Galloway's inventive first novel is about the breakdown of a 27-year-old drama teacher named Joy Stone. The problems of everyday living accumulate and begin to torture Joy, who blames her problems not on her work or on the accidental drowning of her illicit lover, but on herself. While painful and deeply serious, this is a novel of great warmth and energy: it's the wit and irony found in moments of despair that prove to be Joy's salvation. First published by Polygon in 1989 and Dalkey Archive Press in 1994, now available again.	236	October 1st 1989	Joy Stone	Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/468488.The_Trick_is_to_Keep_Breathing
