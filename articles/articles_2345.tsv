Theft of Swords	The Riyria Revelations #1-2	Michael J. Sullivan	4.19	57058	3796	THEY KILLED THE KING. THEY PINNED IT ON TWO MEN. THEY CHOSE POORLY. There's no ancient evil to defeat or orphan destined for greatness, just unlikely heroes and classic adventure. Royce Melborn, a skilled thief, and his mercenary partner, Hadrian Blackwater, are two enterprising rogues who end up running for their lives when they're framed for the murder of the king. Trapped in a conspiracy that goes beyond the overthrow of a tiny kingdom, their only hope is unraveling an ancient mystery before it's too late.	649	November 23rd 2011	Royce Melborn, Hadrian Blackwater, Alric Essendon, Esrahaddon, Myron Lanaklin, Arista Essendon, Percy Braga, Thrace Wood, Gwen Delancy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10790290-theft-of-swords
