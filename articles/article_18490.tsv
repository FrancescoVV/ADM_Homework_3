He Mele A Hilo (A Hilo Song)		Ryka Aoki	4.41	127	21	Something strange is happening in Hilo. Noleani Choiâ€™s new show about the life of Jesus Christ told through hula dance has everyone, especially her halau, wondering what she could possibly be thinking. Rumors circulate about a rich guy from the mainland, and the dancers and their friends must reckon with what is really hula, who is Hawaiian enough, and why each of them wants to dance. On one beautiful island, we discover that loving other people in spite of their flaws might just begin with being true to our own selves.	310	2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21894948-he-mele-a-hilo
