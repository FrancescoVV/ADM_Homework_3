Sketchy Behavior		Erynn Mangum	3.82	1036	161	Drawing Conclusions or Drafting Disaster?Other than harboring a somewhat obsessive fondness for Crispix and completely swearing-off boys after a bad date (donâ€™t ask), sixteen-year-old Kate Carter is about as ordinary as they come, except for her two notable talents: art and sarcasm. After an introduction to forensic sketching in her elective art class, Kate discovers a third and most unexpected gift: criminal profiling. Her photo-quality sketch helps the police catch a wanted murderer and earns her celebrity status in South Woodhaven Falls. But when that murderer appears to be using his friends to exact revenge, Kate goes from local hero to possible target. Will she manage to survive? Will life ever be normal again? And will local news anchor Ted Deffle ever stop sending her flowers?	214	August 9th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10819228-sketchy-behavior
