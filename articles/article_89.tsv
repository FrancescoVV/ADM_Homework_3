The Poisonwood Bible		Barbara Kingsolver	4.07	660338	23329	The Poisonwood Bible is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it -- from garden seeds to Scripture -- is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.	546	September 24th 1998	Orleanna Price, Ruth May Price, Rachel Rebeccah Price, Leah Price, Nathan Price, Dr Bud Wharton, Adah Price, Reverend & Mrs. Underdown	Bethlehem, Georgia (United States), Kilanga (Congo), Sanderling Island, Georgia (United States), Leopoldville , 1959 (Congo), Leopoldville (Congo)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7244.The_Poisonwood_Bible
