The Dead Writer		Núria Añó, Debbie Garrick	4.36	22	4	Anna is a middle-aged writer who has brought up her daughter alone. In the present Berta is grown up, and the desire to meet her father, who she has only ever seen in a photograph, increases as her relationship with her boyfriend reaches crisis point. Hans works in a factory and has a sister, Clara, a misunderstood girl who is infatuated with this guy who rides a motorbike. But, above all, this is the story of Anna Flieder, who decides to write a more biographic-style novel and her inspiration takes the form of the man who abandoned her all those years ago. “The story shows the process of creation of a literary work (...) It’s a novel aimed at those who like to read, those who let themselves be absorbed into the reading because it requires a lot of imagination and there are lots of things which are just hinted at.” -Review in La Mañana “This book tells the story of Anna, a writer, and the world and lives of the people around her. Anna lives her literary life as her real one, suffering from a kind of schizophrenia as the characters in her books collide with her life in their desire to see the light. The original was published in Spain in 2008.” -Debbie Garrick, Translator “The Dead Writer” is, in essence, an invitation to all those who enjoy the way that literature reflects itself within a literary work. But it also represents the opportunity to follow other characters with feelings in situations that inevitably provoke recognition. [...] A delightful literary text which stands out with metaphorical language and suggests images that are capable of depicting daily scenes containing a multitude of possibilities that often, life does not let us see.” -Dr Alexandra Santos Pinheiro, in the magazine Resonancias Literarias, no. 153 “The Dead Writer, a novel which not only demonstrates the author's skill but also how we see her handling of the essential tool of all writers, language. [...] This novel is also an insightful literary artefact which is sure to satisfy the diverse enjoyment of the modern reader." -Letralia, Tierra de Letras "The author Núria Añó masterfully weaves a tale that delves deep into an exploration of the modern individual." -Noury Bakrim, Traductor	205	January 1st 2008	Hans (L'escriptora morta), Clara (L'escriptora morta), Berta (L'escriptora morta), Anna Flieder (L'escriptora morta)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40114920-la-escritora-muerta
