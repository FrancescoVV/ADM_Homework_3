The Wanderer		Sharon Creech, David Díaz	3.85	11373	822	The sea, the sea, the sea. It rolled and rolled and called to me. Come in, it said, come in. Sophie hears the sea calling, promising adventure as she sets sail for England with her three uncles and two cousins. Sophie's cousin Cody isn't sure he has the strength to prove himself to the crew and to his father. Through Sophie's and Cody's travel logs, we hear stories of the past and the daily challenges of surviving at sea as The Wanderer sails toward its destination—and its passengers search for their places in the world.	320	March 22nd 2000		Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69499.The_Wanderer
