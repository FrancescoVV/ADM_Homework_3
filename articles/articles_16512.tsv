Deathwatch		Robb White	3.63	2752	527	Madec was not the kind of man Ben would ordinarily have chosen as a companion for a quiet hunting trip. The only time Madec ever laughed was when he told some story about how smart he was. He was a cold man who liked to hurt things and he was dangerous with a gun. But Ben needed money to pay for another semester at college, and so when Madec offered to hire him as a guide to hunt bighorn sheep in the desert mountains, he agreed. It was a mistake that very nearly cost Ben his life.	224	1972		United States of America, Mojave Desert (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776891.Deathwatch
