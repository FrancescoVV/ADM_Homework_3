Lady Fiasco	My Notorious Aunt #1	Kathleen Baldwin	3.75	2293	247	Can a lady with a reputation for disaster, stumble into love? An unusual heroine, Fiona Hawthorn grew up running free. Without a mother to restrain her, she spends her days riding her horse neck or nothing across her fatherâ€™s fields and swimming like a sea nymph. But inside a prim and proper Regency sitting room Fiona is bound to overturn the teapot or accidentally trip the footman. Her illustrious Aunt Honore decides to take the hoyden in hand, but amidst the strictures of the Beau Monde, Fiona is a fish out of water. When she was younger, Lord Wesmont was her hero. Sadly, he came home from fighting Napoleon a hardened man. Nothing can breathe life back into his cold heart, nothing except, perhaps, the love of an unusual young woman who regularly turns his life upside-down. Lady Fiasco is a Sweet Traditional Regency Romance.	256	September 1st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18804219-lady-fiasco
