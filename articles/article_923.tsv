At Grave's End	Night Huntress #3	Jeaniene Frost	4.30	82222	2778	Some Things Won’t Stay Buried … At Grave’s End It should be the best time of half-vampire Cat Crawfield’s life. With her undead lover Bones at her side, she’s successfully protected mortals from the rogue undead. But though Cat’s worn disguise after disguise to keep her true identity a secret from the brazen bloodsuckers, her cover’s finally been blown, placing her in terrible danger. As if that wasn’t enough, a woman from Bones’s past is determined to bury him once and for all. Caught in the crosshairs of a vengeful vamp, yet determined to help Bones stop a lethal magic from being unleashed, Cat’s about to learn the true meaning of bad blood. And the tricks she’s learned as a special agent won’t help her. She will need to fully embrace her vampire instincts in order to save herself – and Bones – from a fate worse than the grave.	342	December 20th 2008	Denise MacGregor, Bones (Night Huntress series), Catherine Crawfield-Russell, Spade (Night Huntress series), Mencheres, Tate Bradley, Don Williams, Vlad Tepesh, Ian Flannery, Annette De Witt	Richmond, Virginia (United States), British Columbia (Canada), Tennessee (United States), South Dakota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3570231-at-grave-s-end
