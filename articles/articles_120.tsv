The Shadow of the Wind	El cementerio de los libros olvidados #1	Carlos Ruiz Zafón, Lucia Graves	4.27	466341	36092	Barcelona, 1945: A city slowly heals from its war wounds, and Daniel, an antiquarian book dealer's son who mourns the loss of his mother, finds solace in a mysterious book entitled The Shadow of the Wind, by one Julian Carax. But when he sets out to find the author's other works, he makes a shocking discovery: someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book Carax has written. In fact, Daniel may have the last of Carax's books in existence. Soon Daniel's seemingly innocent quest opens a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets--an epic story of murder, madness, and doomed love. --back cover	487	May 2001	Daniel Sempere, Fermín Romero de Torres, Julián Carax, Miquel Moliner, Nuria Monfort, Francisco Javier Fumero, Beatriz Aguilar, Jorge Aldaya, Penélope Aldaya, Antoni Fortuny, Clara Barceló, Monsieur Darcieu, Viçenteta, Teniente Palacios, Doña Yvonne Sotoceballos, Jacinta Coronado, Gustavo Barceló, Bernarda, Fernando Ramos, Sophie Carax, Candide (Voltaire), Isaac Monfort, Anacleto	Barcelona	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind
