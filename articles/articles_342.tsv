The Art of Racing in the Rain		Garth Stein	4.21	453409	39060	Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver. Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through. A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life ... as only a dog could tell it.	321	May 13th 2008	Eve, Enzo, Denny Swift, ZoÃ«	Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3153910-the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain
