It is night. She is driving back to her apartment through the campus of a Maine college. A yellow T-bird zooms past her and hits two female pedestrians. One life is ended. One life is suspended in coma. And Kissy's life is changed forever. After the accident, three men enter Kissy's life. One is James Houston, the drunken premed student responsible for the fatal collision. On is Mike Burke, the policeman who arrived at the scene moments later. And one is Junior Clootie, a college hockey star being groomed for the pros, with whom Kissy begins an intensely sexual affair while still shaken by the aftershock of the nightmare experience.	496	1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490138.Survivor
