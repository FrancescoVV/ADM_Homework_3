Point Your Face at This: Drawings		Demetri Martin	3.98	2079	224	The New York Times bestselling writer and comedian Demetri Martin is back with a brand new collection of drawings that urge you to: POINT YOUR FACE AT THIS In his first book, This Is a Book , Demetri Martin introduced fans and readers to his unique brand of long-form humor writing. That book spent twelve weeks on the New York Times bestseller list Now Demetri returns with an eclectic volume devoted entirely to his trademark drawings and word play. Point Your Face at This contains hundreds of hilarious drawings and visual jokes, showcasing Martin's particular penchant for brevity. With a sensibility all its own, this is a great gift book and an absolute must-have for fans of the brainy, ambidextrous, comedian, palindromist (and author), Demetri Martin.	288	October 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13529076-point-your-face-at-this
