The Sinister Urge		Frances Newton	3.13	83	72	What if you had a secret? An irresistible urge? Delve backstage and into the private lives of popular rock band, Lilli and the Munsterz. Returning to the music world after a turbulent split from her former band, Lilli Morgan has risen like a phoenix and has the industry at her feet. “Before the split, it was: ‘Lilli? Everyone always wants to know if there has ever been anything romantic between Adam and you?’ ‘No not at all. I'm quite content being young, free, and single,’ was my standard reply. Now it's: ‘A special man in my life? No, I'm very happy being single. No time for all that.’ I've been peddling that line for years and it's never failed me. Problem is, I do have a special man in my life. A wonderful perfect man … It's just a question of keeping it a secret. But for how long?”	122	April 9th 2014	Lillian Morgan, Anthony 'Tony' Elm Morgan, Sarah Thomas-Carter, Dave Helliwell, Stuart Rudkin, Rafael Stevens, Patricia Morgan, Phil Morgan, Adam Thompson	London, England (United Kingdom), Manchester, England, Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England (United Kingdom), Sheffield, Yorkshire, England York, Yorkshire, England Scotland, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, York, Yorkshire, England, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21946160-the-sinister-urge
