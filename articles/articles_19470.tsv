Men		K.L. Laitinen	4.38	16	8	Kat’s story starts as a child on the shores of her sandy box, then she dives into this thing called Life, paddling her way through a salty sea of androgen, encountering a pervert who smells of Aqua Velva and gefilte fish, a man resembling Peter Frampton on female hormones, the Count of Monte Crisco, a lickerish ladyboy, and a couple of boner fide rock stars, just to name a few. Find out how Kat’s vivid imagination and lonely heart take her on a lifetime’s journey of madcap mishaps and misguided detours as she comes of age in more ways than one, more than once. Taking many ‘wrong’ turns in search of ‘Mr. Right’, the ‘fickle finger of fate’ surely fiddles with hers in this hilariously poignant and entertaining story beginning in 1967, landing on the shores of the New Millennium… Enjoy the ride!	253	August 22nd 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52753051-men
