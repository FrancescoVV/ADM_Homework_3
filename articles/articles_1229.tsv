Cat's Eye		Margaret Atwood	3.92	60330	3440	Cat's Eye is the story of Elaine Risley, a controversial painter who returns to Toronto, the city of her youth, for a retrospective of her art. Engulfed by vivid images of the past, she reminisces about a trio of girls who initiated her into the fierce politics of childhood and its secret world of friendship, longing, and betrayal. Elaine must come to terms with her own identity as a daughter, a lover, and artist, and womanâ€”but above all she must seek release from her haunting memories. Disturbing, hilarious, and compassionate, Cat's Eye is a breathtaking novel of a woman grappling with the tangled knots of her life.	462	September 1988		Toronto, Ontario (Canada), Canada, Ontario (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51019.Cat_s_Eye
