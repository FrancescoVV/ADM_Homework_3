City of Darkness, City of Light		Marge Piercy	3.93	1191	110	In her most splendid, thought-provoking novel yet, Marge Piercy brings to vibrant life three women who play prominent roles in the tumultuous, bloody French Revolution--as well as their more famous male counterparts. Defiantly independent Claire Lacombe tests her theory: if men can make things happen, perhaps women can too. . . . Manon Philipon finds she has a talent for politics--albeit as the ghostwriter of her husband's speeches. . . . And Pauline LÃ©on knows one thing for certain: the women must apply the pressure or their male colleagues will let them starve. While illuminating the lives of Robespierre, Danton, and Condorcet, Piercy also opens to us the minds and hearts of women who change their world, live their ideals--and are prepared to die for them.	479	1996	Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, Madame Roland, Camille Desmoulins, Georges-Jaques Danton, Pauline Leon, Claire Lacombe	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/862108.City_of_Darkness_City_of_Light
