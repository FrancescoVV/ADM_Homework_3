The Big Rusty Lie		Ryan Speck	4.25	4	1	Bernardo Walterhaus is a detective on a mission: find a missing heiress that no one can seem to locate. Armed with cunning wit, luck, and an unerring ability to find trouble, Bernardo will solve the case with the help of his bodyguard/driver and a pack of the most vulgar and violent cops you could have on your side. Bernardo will find an unlikely solution, without a clue or a good idea, as long as the mercenaries, gnomes, orderlies, exploding castles, fake Germans, angry competitors, plane crashes, burning office buildings, board meetings, boiling chocolate, fratboys, and criminal masterminds don't get him first. A surreal comedy caper from Ryan Speck.	204	January 17th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3165887-the-big-rusty-lie
