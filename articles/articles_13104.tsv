Playing for the Ashes	Inspector Lynley #7	Elizabeth  George	4.06	13767	449	"The story begins with my father, actually, and the fact that I'm the one who's answerable for his death. It was not my first crime, as you will see, but it is the one my mother couldn't forgive." In her astonishing New York Times bestseller, acclaimed author Elizabeth George reveals the even darker truth behind this startling confession. Playing for the Ashes is a rich tale of passion, murder and love in which Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers once again find themselves embroiled in a case where nothing—and no one—is really what it seems. Intense, suspenseful and brilliantly written, Playing for the Ashes will make readers "search out the sleuthing pair's first six adventures...a treasure," as Cosmopolitan predicted in their review.	619	1994	Thomas Lynley, Barbara Havers, Lady Helen Clyde, Winston Nkata, Kenneth Fleming, Miriam Whitelaw, Olivia Whitelaw, Jean Cooper, Jimmy Cooper, Chris Faraday, Isabelle Ardery	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/305854.Playing_for_the_Ashes
