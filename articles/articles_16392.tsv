The Cursed	Vampire Huntress #9	L.A. Banks	4.40	1829	40	The Chairman has been killed and now Lilith, Satan’s Consort, sits on the vampire throne as the Vampire Council’s new Chairwoman. She raises all the dark covens, calling every major dark witch and warlock to do her bidding. Her goal is to distract the team members while the unborn heir to the Dark Realms awaits his own birth. All Lilith needs now is Damali’s newly discovered angelic powers. That will allow her evil progeny to walk through the veil between worlds and take his throne as the true Antichrist. Damali and her crew race to stop Lilith. However, raising not only the dark covens but all vampires that had not been slain by Damali, puts the world out of balance and kicks off the Armageddon.	493	July 10th 2007	Damali Richards		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/538379.The_Cursed
