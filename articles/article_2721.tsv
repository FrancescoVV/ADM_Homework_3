The Samurai's Garden		Gail Tsukiyama	4.13	21943	2038	A 20-year-old Chinese painter named Stephen is sent to his family's summer home in a Japanese coastal village to recover from a bout with tuberculosis. Here he is cared for by Matsu, a reticent housekeeper and a master gardener. Over the course of a remarkable year, Stephen learns Matsu's secret and gains not only physical strength, but also profound spiritual insight. Matsu is a samurai of the soul, a man devoted to doing good and finding beauty in a cruel and arbitrary world, and Stephen is a noble student, learning to appreciate Matsu's generous and nurturing way of life and to love Matsu's soul-mate, gentle Sachi, a woman afflicted with leprosy.	211	May 4th 1994	Stephen, Matsu, Kenzo, Sachi, Keiko, Stephen's Father	Tarumi (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51113.The_Samurai_s_Garden
