Mister Mann		Gerrard G. Gerrard	3.94	17	5	Mister Mann tells the story of a man accomplished in mime, magic and martial arts who adds mass murder to his alliterative skill set. "You sit there thinking dark thoughts and beating yourself up for having these bad thoughts. And you say no one has these thoughts like you, but again you are deceived. Everyone has thoughts exactly like you. You don't stand a chance; you were born to think them. It was preordained. It's called conditioning. Everyone thinking the same thoughts, an out of step and dis-configured hive mind. It will be my pleasure to bring everyone into step to unify the hive... and get you all thinking of the ultimate. Death." - Mister Mann	304	May 29th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16204653-mister-mann
