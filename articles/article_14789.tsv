The Reversal	Mickey Haller #3	Michael Connelly	4.16	55970	3175	Longtime defense attorney Mickey Haller is recruited to change stripes and prosecute the high-profile retrial of a brutal child murder. After 24 years in prison, new DNA evidence means convicted killer Jason Jessup has been granted another trial. Haller is convinced Jessup is guilty, and he takes the case on the condition that he gets to choose his investigator, LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. Together, Bosch and Haller set off on a case fraught with political and personal danger. Opposing them is Jessup, now out on bail, a defense attorney who excels at manipulating the media, and a runaway eyewitness reluctant to testify after so many years. With the odds and the evidence against them, Bosch and Haller must nail a sadistic killer once and for all. If Bosch is sure of anything, it is that Jason Jessup plans to kill again.	389	October 5th 2010	Hieronymus "Harry" Bosch, Mickey Haller, Rachel Walling, Lorna Taylor, Maggie McPherson, Gabriel Williams, Jason Jessup, Clive Royce, Maddie Bosch, Sarah Ann Gleason, Edward Roman, Joe Ridell, David Chu, Diane Breitman, David Eisenbach, Denise Graydon, Karen Revelle	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7936809-the-reversal
