Bella Poldark	The Poldark Saga #12	Winston Graham	4.33	4275	415	Cornwall, 1818-1820 The stories of the Poldark family—Ross, the strong, independent squire and his beautiful, outspoken wife Demelza; their son Jeremy; their talented, headstrong daughter Bella; and their long-standing feud with humorless landowner Sir George Warleggan—have sold millions of copies, and in the 1970s were made into the most widely watched TV series of the decade. Now, the twelfth and final novel brings the family story to a close—with Bella taking center stage, moving between her home at Nampara on the rugged Cornish coast and the wildly exciting world of the theater in London and Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.	688	May 1st 2002		Cornwall, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194611.Bella_Poldark
