Untold	The Lynburn Legacy #2	Sarah Rees Brennan	3.92	13491	1412	It's time to choose sides.... On the surface, Sorry-in-the-Vale is a sleepy English town. But Kami Glass knows the truth. Sorry-in-the-Vale is full of magic. In the old days, the Lynburn family ruled with fear, terrifying the people into submission in order to kill for blood and power. Now the Lynburns are back, and Rob Lynburn is gathering sorcerers so that the town can return to the old ways. But Rob and his followers aren’t the only sorcerers in town. A decision must be made: pay the blood sacrifice, or fight. For Kami, this means more than just choosing between good and evil. With her link to Jared Lynburn severed, she’s now free to love anyone she chooses. But who should that be? A darkly humorous take on Gothic romance, Sarah Rees Brennan's Lynburn Legacy weaves together the tale of a heroine desperate to protect those she loves, two boys hoping to be saved, and the magical forces that will shape their destiny.	336	August 29th 2013	Holly Prescott, Kami Glass, Angela Montgomery, Jared Lynburn, Ash Lynburn	Sorry-in-the-Vale (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801763-untold
