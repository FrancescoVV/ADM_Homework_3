Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns		Andrea Gibson	4.50	2169	166	Andrea Gibson's dynamic and energetic first book, Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns , challenges us to not only read, but to react. Hauntingly vivid, the poems march through a soldier's lingering psychological wounds, tackle the curious questions of school children on the meaning of "hate," and tangle with a lover's witty and vibrant description of longing. Gibson's poems deconstruct the current political climate through stunning imagery and careful crafting. With the same velocity, the poignant and vacillating love poems sweep the air out of the room. It's word-induced hypoxia. Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns whispers with a bold and unforgettable internal voice rich with the kind of questioning that inspires action.	99	June 13th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3425041-pole-dancing-to-gospel-hymns
