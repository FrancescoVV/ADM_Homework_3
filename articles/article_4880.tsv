The Falls		Joyce Carol Oates	3.58	9800	932	It is 1950 and, after a disastrous honeymoon night, Ariah Erskine's young husband throws himself into the roaring waters of Niagara Falls. Ariah, "the Widow Bride of the Falls," begins a relentless seven-day vigil in the mist, waiting for his body to be found. At her side is confirmed bachelor and pillar of the community Dirk Burnaby, who is unexpectedly drawn to this plain, strange woman. What follows is a passionate love affair, marriage, and family--a seemingly perfect existence. But the tragedy by which they were thrown together begins to shadow them, damaging their idyll with distrust, greed, and even murder. Set against the mythic-historic backdrop of Niagara Falls in the mid-twentieth century, this haunting exploration of the American family in crisis is a stunning achievement from "one of the great artistic forces of our time" ( The Nation ).	512	2004	Gilbert Erskine, Ariah Juliet Littrell, Reverend Thaddeus Littrell, Dirk Burnaby, Royall Burnaby, Chandler Burnaby, Juliet Burnaby, Reginald Burnaby, Clyde Colborne, Buzz Fitch, Claudine Burnaby, Nina Olshaker, Stroughton Howell, Bud Stonecrop	Niagara Falls, New York (United States), United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls
