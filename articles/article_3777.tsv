Separated from the girl he loves and has sworn to protect, Froi must travel through Charyn to search for Quintana, the mother of Charyn's unborn king, and protect her against those who will do anything to gain power. But what happens when loyalty to family and country conflict? When the forces marshalled in Charyn's war gather and threaten to involve the whole of the land, including Lumatere, only Froi can set things right, with the help of those he loves.	516	September 26th 2012	Lucian, Phaedra, Finnikin, Froi, Quintana, Isaboe		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10165761-quintana-of-charyn
