Dark Force Rising	Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy #2	Timothy Zahn	4.16	51208	1186	The dying Empire's most cunning and ruthless warlord—Grand Admiral Thrawn—has taken command of the remnants of the Imperial fleet and launched a massive campaign aimed at the New Republic's destruction. Meanwhile, Han and Lando Calrissian race against time to find proof of treason inside the highest Republic Council—only to discover instead a ghostly fleet of warships that could bring doom to their friends and victory to their enemies. Yet most dangerous of all is a new Dark Jedi, risen from the ashes of a shrouded past, consumed by bitterness… and scheming to corrupt Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side.	439	June 1992	Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, Mara Jade, Thrawn, Gilad Pellaeon, Wedge Antilles, Talon Karrde, Leia Organa, Khabarakh, Joruus C'baoth, Borsk Fey'lya, Garm Bel Iblis, Han Solo		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216442.Dark_Force_Rising
