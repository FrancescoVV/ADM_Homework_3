Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Dailies and Sundays 1979-1980		Jim Lawrence, Daniel Herman, Gray Morrow	4.00	5	1	With the success of the Buck Rogers TV show the New York Times Syndicate decided to revive the classic Buck Rogers newspaper feature and to give it a contemporary sci-fi treatment. The feature, which was unrelated to the television show, offered the artwork of Gray Morrow with scripts by Jim Lawrence. Volume One offers a full two years of the strip with the black and white dailies and full-color Sundays. This material has never before been offered in its original version.	222	April 16th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16231263-buck-rogers-in-the-25th-century
