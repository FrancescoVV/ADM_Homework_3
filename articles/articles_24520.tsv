Frankly in Love		David  Yoon	3.80	17210	3810	High school senior Frank Li is a Limbo--his term for Korean-American kids who find themselves caught between their parents’ traditional expectations and their own Southern California upbringing. His parents have one rule when it comes to romance--“Date Korean”--which proves complicated when Frank falls for Brit Means, who is smart, beautiful--and white. Fellow Limbo Joy Song is in a similar predicament, and so they make a pact: they’ll pretend to date each other in order to gain their freedom. Frank thinks it’s the perfect plan, but in the end, Frank and Joy’s fake-dating maneuver leaves him wondering if he ever really understood love--or himself--at all.	432	September 10th 2019	Andrew Kim, Ella Chang, John Lim, William Q Lee, Eun-hee Diane Li, Frank Li, Frank Li Senior, Joy Song	Orange County, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39847584-frankly-in-love
