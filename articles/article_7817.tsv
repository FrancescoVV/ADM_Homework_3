Zazie in the Metro		Raymond Queneau, Barbara Wright, Gilbert Adair	3.71	6580	403	Impish, foul-mouthed Zazie arrives in Paris from the country to stay with her uncle Gabriel. All she really wants to do is ride the metro, but finding it shut because of a strike, Zazie looks for other means of amusement and is soon caught up in a comic adventure that becomes wilder and more manic by the minute. In 1960 Queneau's cult classic was made into a hugely successful film by Louis Malle. Packed full of word play and phonetic games, 'Zazie in the Metro' remains as stylish and witty today as it did back then.	157	January 23rd 1959	Zazie, Gabriel, Turandot, Charles, Laverture, Mado-p'tits pieds, Marceline	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28369.Zazie_in_the_Metro
