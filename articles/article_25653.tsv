Forever Night Stand		Ysa Arcangel, _silverdoe_	4.47	99	44	With her family history of Alzheimer's and at great risk of acquiring the disease, Brandy Curtis always plays safe. She had always avoided commitments like the plague. Ivo Ferrero who was burned out from a string of failed relationships became a ferocious womanizer just to get what he wants out of a relationship which is unadulterated non-committal sex. It started as a one night stand which was followed by another, and another. What happens when a commitment-prone guy falls for a commitment-phobic girl? Will their love built on sexual desire be enough to survive against the odds of losing herself into the recesses of her tangled brain? Find out more about the heart that never forgets and the disease which has the power to rob, damage, and destroy yet cannot vanquish the feeling of love and being loved.
