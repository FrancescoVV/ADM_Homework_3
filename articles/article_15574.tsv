The Christmas Throwaway		R.J. Scott	3.85	3095	410	Christmas is a time for giving - what do you do when no one gives a damn? For Zachary Weston Christmas means sleeping on a churchyard bench in the freezing snow with nothing better in his future. Thrown out of his home for being gay, he is left without money or, it seems, anywhere to go. Until a stranger shows him that some people do give a lot more than a damn. Ben Hamilton is a rookie cop in his small home town. He finds a young throwaway, fresh from the city, sleeping on a bench in the churchyard on a snowy Christmas Eve. Can he be the one to give Zachary his own Christmas miracle? * * * * * First published December 2010	73	2010	Zachary "Zach" Isaiah Weston, Benjamin "Ben" Andrew Hamilton	Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9615767-the-christmas-throwaway
