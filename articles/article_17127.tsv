The Restorer		Daniela Murphy	4.25	24	9	In the dying days of the 20th Century, Elfa, a restorer in Florence, uncovers a hidden fresco in a remote church in the frozen hills of the Mugello. Lost for five centuries, the painting not only rewrites art history, but takes her on a dark journey through her own subconscious, to meet the man who concealed it hundreds of years before.
