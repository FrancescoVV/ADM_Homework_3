Fanny Hill, or Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure		John Cleland	3.31	10833	857	One of the most prosecuted and banned books in history. The classic novel of a young girl's exploration of physical pleasures. Young Fanny Hill is tricked into a life of prostitution, but she quickly learns the power of her own body as she learns the ways of physical passion. She soon escapes her fate for the loving arms of a wealthy young man, but misadventure and fate conspire to keep her from domestic bliss. Instead, Fanny discovers that sex need not be just for love; that it can be had for pleasure. She then sets out to explore those pleasures in as wide a variety as she can. With old men and young, and women as well; in positions of power, and situations where she has none; either watching or participating, Fanny's journey through the realms of sexual pleasure is a literary tour-de-force.	224	November 21st 1748	Fanny Hill	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195144.Fanny_Hill_or_Memoirs_of_a_Woman_of_Pleasure
