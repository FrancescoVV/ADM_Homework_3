L'Assommoir	Les Rougon-Macquart #7	Émile Zola, Robin Buss	4.03	12919	558	The seventh novel in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, L'Assommoir (1877) is the story of a woman's struggle for happiness in working-class Paris. At the center of the story stands Gervaise, who starts her own laundry and for a time makes a success of it. But her husband soon squanders her earnings in the Assommoir, a local drinking spot, and gradually the pair sink into poverty and squalor. L'Assommoir was a contemporary bestseller, outraged conservative critics, and launched a passionate debate about the legitimate scope of modern literature. This new translation captures not only the brutality but the pathos of its characters' lives.	480	1876	Étienne Lantier, Gervaise Macquart, Nana Coupeau, Claude Lantier, Auguste Lantier, Coupeau, Goujet, Virginie Poisson	Paris (France), France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92967.L_Assommoir
