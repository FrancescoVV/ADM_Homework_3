Betsy-Tacy	Betsy-Tacy #1	Maud Hart Lovelace, Lois Lenski	4.05	23037	1152	Best Friends Forever There are lots of children on Hill Street, but no little girls Betsy's age. So when a new family moves into the house across the street, Betsy hopes they will have a little girl she can play with. Sure enough, they do—a little girl named Tacy. And from the moment they meet at Betsy's fifth birthday party, Betsy and Tacy become such good friends that everyone starts to think of them as one person—Betsy-Tacy. Betsy and Tacy have lots of fun together. They make a playhouse from a piano box, have a sand store, and dress up and go calling. And one day, they come home to a wonderful surprise—a new friend named Tib. Ever since their first publication in the 1940's, the Betsy-Tacy stories have been loved by each generation of young readers.	144	1940	Betsy Ray, Tacy Kelly, Katie Kelly, Bee Kelly, Mrs. Ray (Betsy-Tacy), Robert Ray, Mrs. Kelly, Paul Kelly, Julia Ray, Mr. Kelly, Mrs. Chubbock, George Kelly, Margaret Ray	Mankato (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7909.Betsy_Tacy
