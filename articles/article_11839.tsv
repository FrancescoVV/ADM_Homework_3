The Mauritius Command	Aubrey & Maturin #4	Patrick O'Brian	4.36	13461	506	Captain Jack Aubrey is ashore on half pay without a command—until Stephen Maturin arrives with secret orders for Aubrey to take a frigate to the Cape of Good Hope under a commodore's pennant, there to mount an expedition against the French-held islands of Mauritius and La Réunion. But the difficulties of carrying out his orders are compounded by two of his own captains—Lord Clonfert, a pleasure-seeking dilettante, and Captain Corbett, whose severity pushes his crew to the verge of mutiny.	348	1977	Jack Aubrey, Stephen Maturin, Barrett Bonden, Thomas Pullings		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77431.The_Mauritius_Command
