Saving Gracie		Jill Teitelman	3.83	18	7	"Why didn't I ask where the Women's Lib train was going before I jumped on?" Ruth Kooperman wants to know. Saving Gracie is the story of her rocky journey from carefree East Village poet to last-minute mother to single suburban mom. (I'm pretty sure God didn't expect me to deal with menopause and toilet training at the same time.") And when demonic middle-age mortality threatens to steal her dearest friend, dark female humor to the rescue. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll laugh again. This memoir-like tale covers all the bases: late-life motherhood and dating, single parenting, marriage, divorce and the humorous side of even the darkest times.	322	December 5th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16218406-saving-gracie
