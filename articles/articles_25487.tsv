When my brother and I -- plus our new dog -- end up in the story of Rapunzel, we can't resist climbing her hair. Oh no! Her smooth locks suddenly look like they've been attacked by a cheese grater. Maybe a trim will help...Snip, snip. SNIP. Oops. Now Rapunzel's hair is too short and we're trapped! So we have to: -Find the tower's secret door -Avoid getting swallowed by a giant spider -Locate Pickles (aka the prince) -Reunite Rapunzel with her parents If we don't untangle this knotty tale soon, we could be stuck in this mess for good!	165	April 29th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18527499-bad-hair-day
