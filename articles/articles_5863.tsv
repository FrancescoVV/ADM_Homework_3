A hitman known only as D is blackmailed into killing Jack, but when he tracks him down, his weary conscience won't allow him to murder an innocent man. Finding in each other an unlikely ally, Jack and D are soon on the run from shadowy enemies. Forced to work together to survive, the two men forge a bond that ripens into unexpected passion. Jack sees the wounded soul beneath D's cold, detached exterior, and D finds in Jack the person who can help him reclaim the man he once was. As the day of Jack's testimony approaches, he and D find themselves not only fighting for their lives... but also fighting for their future. A future together.	308	April 6th 2009		Nevada (United States), Los Angeles, California (United States), Baltimore, Maryland (United States), Ohio (United States) Oregon (United States) Lake Tahoe (United States) California (United States), Ohio (United States), Oregon (United States), Lake Tahoe (United States), California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6382879-zero-at-the-bone
