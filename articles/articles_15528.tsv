The Anatomy of Being		Shinji Moon	4.27	4099	176	As Shinji Moon's debut book of poetry, The Anatomy of Being is youthful and fragmented, a journey inward from the perspective of the hopes and pains of adolescence. Broken up into four chapters, she holds your hand and takes you inward with her, from skin to flesh, to flesh to bones, from bones to all that lies within. Both heartbreaking and hopeful, The Anatomy of Being marks a very distinct time in a young girl's life, and aches and aches to be heard and devoured. 2013 Goodreads Choice Awards Poetry Finalist	102	April 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17729031-the-anatomy-of-being
