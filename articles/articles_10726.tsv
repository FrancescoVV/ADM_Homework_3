The Double Life of Zoe Flynn		Janet Lee Carey	3.77	201	29	Zoe Flynn has a secret. She used to live in California, in a big old house -- the best house in the world really -- at 18 Hawk Road. It rambled and creaked and was full of good hiding places. She used to have a best friend named Kellen who lived right down the road, and a dog named Merlin who loved to play with her. But now she lives in a little town in Oregon, and everything has changed. Now, Zoe has to be careful. Careful that she doesn't tell anyone, not her friends or her teacher or especially that cop who's been watching her, that she doesn't live at 18 Hawk Road anymore. That now her family lives in an old green van that's cramped and dirty and doesn't even work all the time. Zoe's always hoping that someday she'll find her way back home.... Lyrically written by Janet Lee Carey, "The Double Life of Zoe Flynn" is a moving novel about hope, family, friendship, and the true definition of a home.	233	January 1st 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/284338.The_Double_Life_of_Zoe_Flynn
