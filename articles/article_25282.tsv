The Taming of a Wild Child	LaBlanc Sisters #2	Kimberly Lang	3.73	310	25	Waking up in a stranger's bed is not how socialite Lorelei LaBlanc planned on spending the morning after the night before. From now on : A) No more secret hookups with Donovan St. Jamesâ€”he's the last man on earth she'd want to share a room with, never mind a king-size bed. B) Maintain a professional persona at all times. After all, he's a hard-hitting journalist who's always on the lookout for the latest scoop and she's perfect tabloid fodder. C) Keep friends close but enemies closer. Donovan may look like the ultimate poster boy but his intentions are anything but PG rated .	224	January 1st 2013	Lorelei LaBlanc, Donovan St. James		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16000996-the-taming-of-a-wild-child
