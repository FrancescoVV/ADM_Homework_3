Metamorphoses		Ovid, David Raeburn, Denis Feeney	4.06	58311	1611	Prized through the ages for its splendor and its savage, sophisticated wit, The Metamorphoses is a masterpiece of Western culture--the first attempt to link all the Greek myths, before and after Homer, in a cohesive whole, to the Roman myths of Ovid's day. Horace Gregory, in this modern translation, turns his poetic gifts toward a deft reconstruction of Ovid's ancient themes, using contemporary idiom to bring today's reader all the ageless drama and psychological truths vividly intact. --From the book jacket	723	8	Odysseus, Venus (Goddess), Ares (god), Perseus, Jupiter (God), Orpheus, Aeneas, Minerva, Juno, Hermaphroditus, Ixion, Pan (Greek), Hermes, Heracles, Mercury, Apollo (Greek god), Hero (mythology), Leander (mythology)	Ancient mythological world	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1715.Metamorphoses
