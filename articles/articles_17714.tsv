Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County		Edgar Rice Burroughs	3.72	120	8	The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County by Edgar Rice Burroughs Buck Mason confronts Ole Gunderstrom regarding an 18 year old feud over a fence, setting off a chain of unexpected events in this Western Adventure. Excerpt: A lone rider drew rein before a gate consisting of three poles cut from straight pine saplings. He leaned from the saddle and dropped one end of each of the two upper bars to the ground, stepped his horse over the remaining bar and, stooping again, replaced the others. Then he rode slowly along a dirt road that showed little signs of travel. As he rode he seemed but an animated part of the surrounding landscape, so perfectly did he harmonize from the crown of his Stetson to the light shod hoofs of his pony. Everything that he wore seemed a part of him, as he seemed a part of his horse. His well worn chaps, his cartridge belt and holster, his shirt and bandana, like the leather of his horse trappings, were toned and mellowed by age and usage; yet they carried the same suggestion of strength and freshness and efficiency as did his bronzed face and his clear, gray eyes.	320	1940			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1041302.Deputy_Sheriff_of_Comanche_County
