Everything I Miss at Home		C.L. Alexander	4.33	3	1	Today begins the last day of Rocquelle "Rocqui" Johnson's 'fairy-tale' life when she abruptly receives a disturbing phone call from her mother that prompts her immediate return to her imperfect past. Fayetteville NC, where she grew up was only three hundreds miles away from Richmond VA, where she now lives. Yet, it was worlds apart from her successful business and her loving fiance Zoric. Rocqui knew that coming home would mean the start of revisiting her childhood bittersweet memories. But nothing prepared her for an encounter with a handsome stranger that may potentially destroy her plans to live 'happily ever after'."	484	July 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12471652-everything-i-miss-at-home
