The Captive Maiden	Hagenheim #4	Melanie Dickerson	4.00	8514	862	Happily Ever After...Or Happily Nevermore? Gisela's childhood was filled with laughter and visits from nobles such as the duke and his young son. But since her father's death, each day has been filled with nothing but servitude to her stepmother. So when Gisela meets the duke's son, Valten—the boy she has daydreamed about for years—and learns he is throwing a ball, she vows to attend, even if it's only for a taste of a life she'll never have. To her surprise, she catches Valten's eye. Though he is rough around the edges, Gisela finds Valten has completely captured her heart. But other forces are bent on keeping the two from falling further in love, putting Gisela in more danger than she ever imagined.	302	October 22nd 2013	Gisela Mueller, Valten Gerstenberg, Margaretha Gerstenberg		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17679368-the-captive-maiden
