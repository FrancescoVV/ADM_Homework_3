13 Minutes		Sarah Pinborough	3.83	10573	1670	They say you should keep your friends close and your enemies closer, but when you're a teenage girl, it's hard to tell them apart. Natasha doesn't remember how she ended up in the icy water that night, but she does know thisâ€”it wasn't an accident, and she wasn't suicidal. Her two closest friends are acting strangely, and Natasha turns to Becca, the best friend she dumped years before when she got popular, to help her figure out what happened. Natasha's sure that her friends love her. But does that mean they didn't try to kill her?	406	February 18th 2016		England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26842622-13-minutes
