Until I Die	Revenants #2	Amy Plum	4.16	27924	2072	Kate and Vincent have overcome the odds and at last they are together in Paris, the city of lights and love. As their romance deepens there’s one question they can’t ignore: How are they supposed to be together if Vincent can’t resist sacrificing himself to save others? Although Vincent promises that he’ll do whatever it takes to lead a normal life with Kate, will that mean letting innocent people die? When a new and surprising enemy reveals itself, Kate realizes that even more may be at stake—and that Vincent’s immortality is in jeopardy. In Die for Me, Amy Plum created a captivating paranormal mythology with immortal revenants and a lush Paris setting. Until I Die is poised to thrill readers with more heart-pounding suspense, spellbinding romance, and a cliff-hanger ending that will leave them desperate for the third and final novel in the series.	353	May 8th 2012	Kate Beaumont Mercier, Vincent Pierre Henri Delacroix, Georgia Frances Mercier, Jules Marchenoir, Ambrose Bates, Charlotte Violaine Lorieux, Charles Aurelien Lorieux, Gaspard Louis-Marie Tabard, Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Balthazar Grimod de La Reynière, Emilie Mercier, Antoine Mercier, Lucien Philippe Henri Poitevin	Paris (France), Villefranche-sur-Mer (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12908877-until-i-die
