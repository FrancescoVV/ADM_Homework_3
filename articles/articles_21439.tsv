All That's Been Said	The Carlington Twins #2	Emma Doherty	4.35	299	23	Izzy Kavanagh hates her new life in the US; that much she’s made obvious. She’s done everything she can to alienate her twin, Ethan, and to prove she doesn’t want to be there. She’s certainly succeeded. Perhaps a little too much. Suddenly the idea of having her brother hate her isn’t what she wants. Knowing her mother would be ashamed of her behaviour weighs on her mind, and the idea of having someone who cares about her isn’t so bad after all. Then there’s her brother’s best friend, Finn. No matter how much she wants to ignore him and pretend she doesn’t care about his opinion, he always seems to be there, and it’s getting harder and harder to act like she’s indifferent to him. But the damage has been done, and now all she can do is count down the days until she’s allowed to return to the UK and forget all about her time in the US. That’s what she’s wanted all along…right?	242	November 7th 2019		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52963295-all-that-s-been-said
