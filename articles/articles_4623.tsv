Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes		Eleanor Coerr, Ronald Himler	4.09	21807	1595	Hiroshima-born Sadako is lively and athletic--the star of her school's running team. And then the dizzy spells start. Soon gravely ill with leukemia, the "atom bomb disease," Sadako faces her future with spirit and bravery. Recalling a Japanese legend, Sadako sets to work folding paper cranes. For the legend holds that if a sick person folds one thousand cranes, the gods will grant her wish and make her healthy again. Based on a true story, Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes celebrates the extraordinary courage that made one young woman a heroine in Japan.	80	January 1st 1977		Japan, Hiroshima (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181077.Sadako_and_the_Thousand_Paper_Cranes
