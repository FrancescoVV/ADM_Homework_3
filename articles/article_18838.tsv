The Change	Unbounded #1	Teyla Branton	3.88	5256	502	There are only two ways to kill Unbounded, and fire isn’t one of them — as law school dropout Erin Radkey learns the hard way. By fluke of a recessive gene, she has become Unbounded, a nearly immortal being with paranormal abilities. Erin’s Change separates her from her loved ones and alters everything she believes to be true. A week earlier she was considering a marriage proposal; now she contemplates the best way to stay alive. Caught in a battle between two Unbounded groups, she is also hunted by a secret mortal society sworn to eradicate the Unbounded gene. Worse, a new identification software could mean death for all Unbounded — or enslavement for the entire mortal world. As Erin plunges into this dangerous new life, she must carve out her own place in the madness, protect her mortal family, and decide which group she should join. Her powerful attraction to Ritter Langton, whose family was massacred by opposing Unbounded two hundred and forty years ago, complicates her choices. There are no second chances. Death, life, or love — Unbounded always play for keeps. Non-stop action, terrifying consequences, and powerful romance make this an exciting addition to the world of urban fantasy.	354	January 7th 2013	Erin Radkey, Ritter Langford, Ava O'Hare, Cort Bagley, Keene McIntyre, Dimitri Sidorov, Justine Carver, Tom Carver, Chris Radkey, Jace Radkey, Stella Davis, Bronson Davis, Laurence Green, John Halden, Tihalt McIntyre, Stefan Carrington, Delia Vesey	Kansas City (United States), Los Angeles, California (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33958974-the-change
