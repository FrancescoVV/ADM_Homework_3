Wake	Wake #1	Lisa McMann	3.75	77849	5499	For seventeen-year-old Janie, getting sucked into other people's dreams is getting old. Especially the falling dreams, the naked-but-nobody-notices dreams, and the sex-crazed dreams. Janie's seen enough fantasy booty to last her a lifetime. She can't tell anybody about what she does they'd never believe her, or worse, they'd think she's a freak. So Janie lives on the fringe, cursed with an ability she doesn't want and can't control. Then she falls into a gruesome nightmare, one that chills her to the bone. For the first time, Janie is more than a witness to someone else's twisted psyche. She is a participant.	210	March 4th 2008	Janie Hannagan, Cabel Strumheller, Captain Fran Komisky, Martha Stubin, Carrie Brandt, Melinda Jeffers	Michigan (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1661957.Wake
