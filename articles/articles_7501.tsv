Phantom Waltz	Kendrick/Coulter/Harrigan #2	Catherine Anderson	4.18	5262	288	New York Times bestselling author Catherine Anderson presents the beloved Coulter family in a novel that's "romantic through and through" ( Publishers Weekly ). One glance. That's all it takes. Wealthy rancher Ryan Kendrick falls hard and fast for lovely Bethany Coulter. A beguiling mix of sass and shyness, naivete and maturity, she shares his passion for horses, has a great sense of humor, and can light up a room with her beautiful smile. She's absolutely perfect--in every way but one... A long-ago barrel-racing accident has left Bethany confined to a wheelchair. In the years since, she has known both betrayal and heartbreak--and vowed never to open her heart to a man again. She has even accepted the possibility that she'll never be able to enjoy a healthy intimate relationship--or have children of her own. But there's something about handsome Ryan Kendrick. Something that makes her believe she can overcome every obstacle. Something that makes her believe in lifelong, lasting love...	418	2001	Bethany Coulter, Ryan Kendrick	Crystal Falls, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89359.Phantom_Waltz
