He Loves Lucy		Susan Donovan	3.86	8775	313	Marketing exec Lucy Cunningham is thrilled when her firm lands The Palm Club account. The campaign concept for Miami's hottest fitness club was Lucy's idea: take one fitness-challenged woman, put her in front of TV cameras, and into the hands of the club's top personal trainer, Theo Redmond. And there's a big cash reward for each pound shed. It seems like a brilliant idea-until Lucy gets picked to be the guinea pig. It's obvious she needs to drop the pounds, but the idea of letting it all hang out in front of some Malibu Ken jock has her choking on her Milk Duds before she even begins! After one meeting, Theo knows Lucy will be his toughest client and one of the most unforgettable women he'll ever meet. Smart-mouthed and stubborn, it's clear she isn't fond of marching to anyone's drumbeat but her own. But she shocks Theo by rising to the challenge like a pro. And he finds his heart in jeopardy long before Lucy starts to slim down and turn heads. As Lucy sweats her way into a whole new life, things start to heat up between her and Theo. But trust doesn't come easy for either of them. They've both been burned by romance in the past. Now Lucy and Theo are about to discover that appearances can be deceiving-and in the end, true love lies somewhere between pizza and Pilates...	335	December 15th 2002	Lucy Cunningham, Theo Redmond, Emma Jenkins, Thomas Tobin, Autumn (Audie) Adams, Detective Stacey Quinn, Katharine "Kat" Cavanaugh, Riley Bohland, Josephine Sheehan, Rick Rousseau, Jack Tolliver, Samantha Monroe, Lily Monroe (daughter), Greg Monroe (son)	United States of America, San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73093.He_Loves_Lucy
