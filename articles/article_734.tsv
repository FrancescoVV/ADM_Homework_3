The Portrait of a Lady		Henry James, Patricia Crick, Claude Bonnafont	3.77	73262	2837	When Isabel Archer, a beautiful, spirited American, is brought to Europe by her wealthy Aunt Touchett, it is expected that she will soon marry. But Isabel, resolved to determine her own fate, does not hesitate to turn down two eligible suitors. She then finds herself irresistibly drawn to Gilbert Osmond, who, beneath his veneer of charm and cultivation, is cruelty itself. A story of intense poignancy, Isabel's tale of love and betrayal still resonates with modern audiences.	797	1881	Isabel Archer, Lydia Touchett, Ralph Touchett, Lord Warburton, Gilbert Osmond, Edward Rosier, Caspar Goodwood, Pansy Osmond, Madame Merle, Henrietta Stackpole	England, Rome (Italy), Florence (Italy), Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/264.The_Portrait_of_a_Lady
