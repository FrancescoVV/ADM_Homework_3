No Comebacks		Frederick Forsyth, Ib Christiansen	3.92	3694	180	Here are ten suspenseful, serpentine stories of betrayal, blackmail, murder, and revenge... all culminating in shocking twists of fate. Within these pages live a wealth of characters you will not soon forget... people whose lives become irrevocably trapped in a world of no comebacks, beyond the point of no return--from the manipulators and the manipulated to the ultra-rich capable of buying and selling human lives, to the everyday man maneuvered by circumstances into performing deadly acts of violence.	320	1972			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109514.No_Comebacks
