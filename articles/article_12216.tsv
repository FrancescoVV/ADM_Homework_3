Open City		Teju Cole	3.50	13848	1748	Along the streets of Manhattan, a young Nigerian doctor doing his residency wanders aimlessly. The walks meet a need for Julius: they are a release from the tightly regulated mental environment of work, and they give him the opportunity to process his relationships, his recent breakup with his girlfriend, his present, his past. But it is not only a physical landscape he covers; Julius crisscrosses social territory as well, encountering people from different cultures and classes who will provide insight on his journeyâ€”which takes him to Brussels, to the Nigeria of his youth, and into the most unrecognizable facets of his own soul.	259	February 8th 2011		New York City, New York (United States), Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States), Upper West Side, Manhattan, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8526694-open-city
