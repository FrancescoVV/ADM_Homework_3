Haunted	The Mediator #5	Meg Cabot	4.14	36343	852	Is it possible to be haunted by someone who isn't even dead? Suze is used to trouble, but this time she's in deep: Ghostly Jesse has her heart, but Paul Slater, a real flesh-and-blood guy, is warm for her form. And mediator Paul knows how to send Jesse to the Great Beyond. For good. Paul claims he won't do anything to Jesse as long as Suze will go out with him. Fearing she'll lose Jesse forever, Suze agrees. But even if Suze can get Jesse to admit his true feelings for her, what kind of future can she have with a guy who's already dead?	263	January 21st 2003	Hector de Silva (Jesse), Father Dominic, Susannah "Suze" Simon, Paul Slater, Kelly Prescott, Rick Slater, Andy Ackerman, Jake Ackerman (Sleepy), Brad Ackerman (Dopey), David Ackerman (Doc), Neil Jankow	Carmel-by-the-Sea, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23225.Haunted
