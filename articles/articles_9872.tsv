The Devil's Alternative		Frederick Forsyth	4.06	13555	237	Russia faces famine. The Soviets are forced to pin their hopes for survival on the U.S. But as the KGB and the CIA watch in horror, the rescue of a Ukrainian freedom fighter from the Black Sea unleashes savagery that endangers peace--and plunges leaders from Washington to Moscow into a web of overwhelming intrigue, terror, and suspense. Only two lovers can save the world from nuclear destruction. Yet every way out means certain death, and the countdown has already begun.	432	1979			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/825473.The_Devil_s_Alternative
