Legacy	The Outliers #2	Claire Chilton	3.70	153	21	A rebellious teenage outcast is their only hope... She's wild and outspoken. Trouble follows Carla Mainston wherever she goes. But what do you expect from a purple outcast living in a green colony? When a deadly disease spreads through the colony, and Carla's brother Joe becomes infected, she knows she has to find a cure before it's too late. But when her genetics kick in, and she begins inheriting mysterious superpowers, her life becomes a whole new level of crazy. If she can just get a handle on her new powers, which so far only seem to make her gooey over boys, maybe she can become a superhero and save everyone, assuming she doesn’t get arrested or have the life sucked out of her before then…	264	August 30th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52330929-legacy
