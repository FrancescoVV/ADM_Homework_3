Blackberry Wine		Joanne Harris	3.80	13484	884	Jay Mackintosh is trapped by memory in the old familiar landscape of his childhood, more enticing than the present, and to which he longs to return. A bottle of home-brewed wine left to him by a long vanished friend seems to provide both the key to an old mystery and a doorway into another world. As the unusual properties of the strange brew takes effect, Jay escapes to a derelict farmhouse in the French village of Lansquenet , where a ghost from the past waits to confront him, and the reclusive Marise -haunted, lovely, and dangerous- hides a terrible secret behind her closed shuters. Between them, a mysterious chemistry. Or could it be magic?	368	September 28th 1999	Jay Mackintosh, Joseph "Jackapple Joe" Cox, Caro Clairmont, Toinette, Josephine Bonnet, Marise d'Api, Roux, Mireille Faizande	Lansquenet-sous-Tannes (France), London, England (United Kingdom), Pog Hill (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15101.Blackberry_Wine
