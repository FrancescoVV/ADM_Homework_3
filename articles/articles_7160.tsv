Beautiful Broken Things	Beautiful Broken Things #1	Sara  Barnard	3.80	7620	995	I was brave She was reckless We were trouble Best friends Caddy and Rosie are inseparable. Their differences have brought them closer, but as she turns sixteen Caddy begins to wish she could be a bit more like Rosie – confident, funny and interesting. Then Suzanne comes into their lives: beautiful, damaged, exciting and mysterious, and things get a whole lot more complicated. As Suzanne’s past is revealed and her present begins to unravel, Caddy begins to see how much fun a little trouble can be. But the course of both friendship and recovery is rougher than either girl realises, and Caddy is about to learn that downward spirals have a momentum of their own.	322	February 11th 2016		Brighton, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25437747-beautiful-broken-things
