Can Aaron conquer his greatest fear and love Keira with no holds barred? When the prince requests Aaron’s aid in dealing with a rogue dragon in the city, their love is put to the test as events sweep Keira and her sister, Anna, into a terrifying ordeal. Anna longs to find her own happily-ever-after, but the only man paying her any attention is Max, Aaron’s clansman. Handsome and confident, Max meets Anna’s withering scorn head-on, causing sparks to fly. But her loathing of Max is quickly forgotten when she becomes ensnared in dragon dealings that endanger her life. Will the events that Keira and Anna have to face at the hands of Aaron’s greatest enemy lead them to happiness, or destroy their lives forever?
