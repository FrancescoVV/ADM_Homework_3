The Bad Place		Dean Koontz	3.91	33602	704	Frank Pollard is afraid to fall asleep. Every morning when he awakes, he discovers something strange--like blood on his hands--a bizarre mystery that tortures his soul. Two investigators have been hired to follow the haunted man. But only one person--a young man with Down's Syndrome--can imagine where their journeys might end. That terrible place from which no one ever returns.	417	January 13th 1990		Southern California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32430.The_Bad_Place
