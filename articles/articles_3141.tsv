Black Lies		Alessandra Torre	4.29	27588	4332	Brant: Became a tech billionaire by his twentieth birthday. Has been in a relationship with me for 3 years. Has proposed 4 times. Been rejected 4 times. Lee: Cuts grass when he's not banging housewives. Good with his hands, his mouth, and his body. Has been pursued relentlessly by me for almost 2 years, whether he knows it or not. Go ahead. Judge me. You have no idea what my love entails. If you think you've heard this story before, trust me - you haven't. **This is a STANDALONE full-length novel. It is not part of a series, and does not contain a cliffhanger.**	290	August 14th 2014	Lee, Brant Sharp, Layana Fairmont	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22471294-black-lies
