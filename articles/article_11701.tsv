The Silver Chalice		Thomas B. Costain, Peggy Noonan, Amy Welborn	4.10	3987	172	The colorful, passionate world of early Christianity comes to vivid life in this story of Basil of Antioch. Basil, a sensitive artisan, is purchased from slavery and commissioned to create a decorative casing for the Chalice that Jesus used at the Last Supper. Basil travels to Jerusalem, Greece, and Rome, meets the apostles, braves the perils of persecution, and finally makes a fateful choice that allows him to “see” Jesus. The dramatic plot, compelling characters, and spiritual depth of The Silver Chalice made it one of the most popular historical novels of the twentieth century.	840	1952	Paul of Tarsus, Basil, Joseph of Arimathea, Helena, Deborra, Luke the Physician, Linus, Ignatius, Persis, Adam ben Asher	Rome (Italy), Jerusalem (Israel), Antioch (Turkey), Aleppo, Syria	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122771.The_Silver_Chalice
