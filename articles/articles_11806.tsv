Home of the Gentry		Ivan Turgenev, Richard Freeborn	3.92	3513	181	"Home of the Gentry" is a novel by Ivan Turgenev published in the January 1859 issue of "Sovremennik". It was enthusiastically received by the Russian society and remained his least controversial and most widely-read novel until the end of the 19th century. It was turned into a movie by Andrey Konchalovsky in 1969. The novel's protagonist is Fyodor Ivanych Lavretsky, a nobleman who shares many traits with Turgenev. The child of a distant, Anglophile father and a serf mother who dies when he is very young, Lavretsky is brought up at his family's country estate home by a severe maiden aunt, often thought to be based on Turgenev's own mother who was known for her cruelty.	298	1859	Fyodor Ivanovych Lavretsky, Elizaveta Mikhaylovna, Vladimir Nikolaich Panshin, Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin, Marfa Timofeyevna Pestov, Christopher Theodore Gottlieb Lemm, Varvara Pavlovna Lavretsky, Glafira Petrovna, Sergey Petrovich Gedeonovsky, Mikhalevich, Elena Mikhaylovna, Agafya Vlasyevna	Russia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28463.Home_of_the_Gentry
