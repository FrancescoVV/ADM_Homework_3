The Case On A Cliff		Orr Agam	4.75	4	3	Jacob is a nearly broke Bay Area Private Investigator who has not had a case for a considerable amount of time. One day a woman enters his office to find her missing brother, Tony Cliff. Jacob tracks Tony to LITTER, a Silicon Valley Tech Company. There he finds out that Tony may or may not be selling methamphetamine to the LITTER Programmers. Jacob enlists his friend Tommy to help find Tony. They have a troubled relationship due to an incident when they were in high school where Tommy believed Jacob turned on him. Everything is not what it seems as Jacob gets in over his head, including a bare knuckle fight with a cat, shady cops, a crazy night in Las Vegas, and is left dangling as he tries to solve The Case On A Cliff.	112	October 30th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42600148-the-case-on-a-cliff
