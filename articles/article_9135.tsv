Tonio Kr√∂ger		Thomas Mann, John J.   White, Ann White	3.73	5808	249	A title in the Bristol Classical Press German Texts series, in German with English notes, vocabulary and introduction. Thomas Mann (1875-1955), was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929, and "Tonio Kroger" occupies a central position in his spiritual and artistic development. A study of youth, it draws together many strands of his life and work: the duality of his parentage; his abhorrence of discipline; and the influence of Schopenhauer and Wagner on his early phase of writing.	67	1903			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82660.Tonio_Kr_ger
