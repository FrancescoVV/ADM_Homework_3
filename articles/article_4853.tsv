Zoroastrians' Fight for Survival	The Viking's Kurdish Love #1	Widad Akreyi	4.70	10	2	Two vikings – one of whom is the formidable former Varangian Guard whose name is carved on a marble slab in Constantinople's Hagia Sophia – settle down in Kurdland, driven by different objectives. Though broken and defined by the opportunities and challenges imposed on them, they both long for recognition and affection. As their lives intertwine with the enchanting and virtuous doctor, Vesta, the successful Palace manager, Zara, and the newly coronated Kurdish King, Saaid, they try to deal with the inevitable trials of love and loss at a time when uncertainty continues to cloud their future. Well-researched and seductively charming, The Viking's Kurdish Love spans across continents, cultures, religions and decades of tumultuous regional and global history. Widad's lyrical prose sensuously immerses the reader in the thoughts and perspectives of the time while creatively weaving the themes of injustice, identity, impulsive decisions, traumas, survival, deprival and revival into the story of how the people of the era refuse to be trapped by their past experiences.	480	August 19th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55482749-zoroastrians-fight-for-survival
