Bobby Whitlock: A Rock 'n' Roll Autobiography		Bobby Whitlock, Marc Roberty	3.98	58	4	From early childhood singing in church to the rock 'n' roll limelight of Derek and the Dominos, Bobby Whitlock launched a musical journey still going to this day. Whitlock's life story does more than share rock gossip about stars like Keith Moon, George Harrison, and Eric Clapton, however. Whitlock candidly discusses his abusive childhood, his experiences with Delaney and Bonnie, failed marriages, and drug addiction, and how the star-studded lifestyle evolved into a peaceful partnership with his wife and musical partner.	248	December 17th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9320208-bobby-whitlock
