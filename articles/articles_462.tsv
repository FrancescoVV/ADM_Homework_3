Lover Awakened	Black Dagger Brotherhood #3	J.R. Ward	4.44	162091	6960	In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there’s a deadly war raging between vampires and their slayers. And there exists a secret band of brothers like no other - six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Of these, Zsadist is the most terrifying member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. A former blood slave, the vampire Zsadist still bears the scars from a past filled with suffering and humiliation. Renowned for his unquenchable fury and sinister deeds, he is a savage feared by humans and vampires alike. Anger is his only companion, and terror is his only passion—until he rescues a beautiful aristocrat from the evil Lessening Society. Bella is instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses. But even as their desire for one another begins to overtake them both, Zsadist’s thirst for vengeance against Bella’s tormentors drives him to the brink of madness. Now, Bella must help her lover overcome the wounds of his tortured past, and find a future with her…	448	September 5th 2006	Mary Luce, Marissa, Butch Brian O'Neal, Zsadist, Bella Soang, Vishous (Black Dagger), Phury, Beth (Elizabeth) Randall, John Matthew, Tohrment, Rehvenge, Wellesandra, The Scribe Virgin, Rhage, Wrath (Blind King)	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42900.Lover_Awakened
