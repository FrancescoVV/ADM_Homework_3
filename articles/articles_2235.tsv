Midnight Awakening	Midnight Breed #3	Lara Adrian	4.24	40910	1123	With a dagger in her hand and vengeance on her mind, Darkhaven beauty Elise Chase prowls Boston’s streets in search of retribution against the Rogue vampires who took from her everything she cherished. Using an extraordinary psychic gift, she tracks her prey, well aware that the power she possesses is destroying her. She must learn to harness this gift, and for that she can turn to only one man—the deadliest of the Breed warriors, Tegan. No stranger to loss, Tegan knows Elise’s pain. He knows fury, but when he slays his enemies it is with ice in his veins. He is perfect in his self-control, until Elise seeks his aid in her personal war. An unholy alliance is forged—a bond that will link them by blood and vow—and plunge them into a tempest of danger, desire, and the darkest passions of the heart. . . .	369	November 27th 2007	Elise Chase, Gabrielle Maxwell, Brock, Lucan Thorne, Dante Malebranche, Tegan	Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Berlin (Germany), Prague (Praha) (Czech Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1388813.Midnight_Awakening
