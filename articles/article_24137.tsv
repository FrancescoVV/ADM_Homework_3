Silent Melody	Georgian #2	Mary Balogh	3.78	2981	291	Lady Emily Marlowe was beautiful, wild, and unspoiled. She could not hear or speak, though she listened with her eyes and answered with her smile. She was betrothed to a man who would have her as a pretty possession, a captive listener. But there was only one man for her—the dark and reckless Lord Ashley Kendrick, the childhood amour who inspired her fantasies—then left for India and found another love. Seven years and countless dreams later, he returned to her, and love was born with a dance, a minuet that stirred her soul, a song so passionate it has no words.	361	August 1st 1997	Emily Marlowe, Ashley Kendrick	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78523.Silent_Melody
