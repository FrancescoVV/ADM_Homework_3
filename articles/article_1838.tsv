A Conjuring of Light	Shades of Magic #3	V.E. Schwab	4.34	86709	12057	Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies. THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED... The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise. WHO WILL CRUMBLE? Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving Antari - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive? WHO WILL RISE? Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the Night Spire collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible. WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL? And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.	624	February 21st 2017	Kell Maresh, Rhy Maresh, Holland Vosijk, Delilah "Lila" Bard, Alucard Emery, Osaron, Ojka, Maxim Maresh, Emira Maresh, Tieren Serense, Edward "Ned" Archibald Tuttle III	Red London (United Kingdom), White London (United Kingdom), Grey London (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939230-a-conjuring-of-light
