The Fever		Megan Abbott	3.11	22597	2893	In this impossible-to-put-down "panic attack of a novel," a small-town high school becomes the breeding ground for a mysterious illness. Deenie Nash is a diligent student with a close-knit family; her brother Eli is a hockey star, and her father is a popular teacher. But when Deenie's best friend is struck by a terrifying, unexplained seizure in class, the Nashes' seeming stability dissolves into chaos. As rumors of a hazardous outbreak spread through school, and hysteria and contagion swell, a series of tightly held secrets emerges, threatening to unravel friendships, families, and the town's fragile sense of security. The Fever is a chilling story about guilt, lies, and the lethal power of desire.	307	June 17th 2014	Tom Nash, Eli Nash, Deenie Nash, Lise Daniels, Skye Osbouurne, Gabby Bishop, Kim Court, Sheila Daniels, Sean Lurie, Brooke Campos, Nat Dubow, Jaymie Hurwich, Dave Hurwich, Billy Gaughan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656036-the-fever
