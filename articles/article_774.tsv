The Reckoning	Darkest Powers #3	Kelley Armstrong	4.19	108831	3622	Chloe Saunders is fifteen and would love to be normal. Unfortunately, Chloe happens to be a genetically engineered necromancer who can raise the dead without even trying. She and her equally gifted (or should that be 'cursed'?) friends are now running for their lives from the evil corporation that created them. As if that's not enough, Chloe is struggling with her feelings for Simon, a sweet-tempered sorcerer, and his brother Derek, a not so sweet-tempered werewolf. And she has a horrible feeling she's leaning towards the werewolf... Definitely not normal.	391	April 6th 2010	Chloe Saunders, Derek Souza, Victoria 'Tori' Enright, Simon Bae		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6468666-the-reckoning
