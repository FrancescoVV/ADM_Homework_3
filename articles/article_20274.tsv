Probo's Lament (The True Adventures of a Small-town Elephant in the City of Big Shoulders)		Gene Lubin	5.00	2	1	Probo is a young trumpet-playing circus elephant who, plagued with suspicions that Shakey, the one-legged anteater, is trying to steal the spotlight from him, runs off to Chicago in hopes of making a name for himself. There he meets up with Zyg Zypltowvtz, a local Democratic precinct captain who operates a small, run-down hotel. Accompanied by his old pal Opie and the latter's chain-smoking grandmother, a former carny by the name of Betty Bumps, the downcast trumpet player agrees to perform at an upcoming event which promises to stand Chicago audiences on their heads. Unbeknownst to Probo, Zyg's behind the scenes maneuvering sets the stage for what may be one of the most outrageous and least known episodes in the sordid annals of Chicago politics. Not for children.	136	2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17561347-probo-s-lament
