The Child	Kate Waters #2	Fiona Barton	3.95	43143	4512	When a paragraph in an evening newspaper reveals a decades-old tragedy, most readers barely give it a glance. But for three strangers it’s impossible to ignore. For one woman, it’s a reminder of the worst thing that ever happened to her. For another, it reveals the dangerous possibility that her darkest secret is about to be discovered. And for the third, a journalist, it’s the first clue in a hunt to uncover the truth. The Child’s story will be told.	448	June 27th 2017	Kate Waters	London, England (United Kingdom), England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35535454-the-child
