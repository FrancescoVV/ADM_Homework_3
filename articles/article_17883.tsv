The Cossacks and Other Stories		Leo Tolstoy, Paul Foote, David McDuff	4.00	615	45	In 1851, at the age of twenty-two, Tolstoy joined the Russian army. The four years he spent as a soldier were among the most significant in his life and inspired the tales collected here. In ?The Cossacks,? Tolstoy tells the story of Olenin, a cultured Russian whose experiences among the Cossack warriors of Central Asia leave him searching for a more authentic life. ?The Sevastopol Sketches? bring into stark relief the realities of military life during the Crimean War. And ?Hadji Murat? paints a portrait of a great leader torn apart by divided loyalties. In writing about individuals and societies in conflict, Tolstoy has penned some of the most brilliant stories about the nature of war.	483	1863			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212687.The_Cossacks_and_Other_Stories
