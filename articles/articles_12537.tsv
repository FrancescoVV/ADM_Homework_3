Frost Burned	Mercy Thompson #7	Patricia Briggs	4.35	63225	3621	Patricia Briggs's novel River Marked was praised as "an urban fantasy where our everyday world is believably twisted into the world of fey, werewolves, vampires, and myths made real." Now Mercy Thompson faces a shapeshifter's biggest fear as the realm she has embraced is thrown into chaos... Mercy Thompson's life has undergone a seismic change. Becoming the mate of Adam Hauptman - the charismatic Alpha of the local werewolf pack - has made her a stepmother to his daughter Jesse, a relationship that brings moments of blissful normalcy to Mercy's life. But on the edges of humanity, a minor mishap on an ordinary day can turn into so much more... After an accident in bumper-to-bumper traffic, Mercy and Jesse can't reach Adam - or anyone else in the pack for that matter. They've all been abducted. Through their mating bond, all Mercy knows is that Adam is angry and in pain. But she fears Adam's disappearance may be related to the political battle the werewolves have been fighting to gain acceptance from the public - and that he and the pack are in serious danger. Outmatched and on her own, Mercy may be forced to seek assistance from any ally she can get, no matter how unlikely.	342	March 5th 2013	Adam Hauptman, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Honey Jorgenson, Wulfe, Kyle Brooks, Stefan Uccello, Marsilia, Gabriel Sandoval, Tony Montenegro, Tad Adelbertsmiter	Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13413589-frost-burned
