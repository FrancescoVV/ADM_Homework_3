The Candy Shop		S.R. Claridge	5.00	4	1	When Kira Sullivan's best friend convinces her to interview at a new nightclub on the St. Louis Riverfront, she has no idea it is run by the Coronado Mob family; nor that there are ties to her husband's law firm, Parker, Sullivan & Bates. By the time she connects the dots, it's too late... she's trapped in a web of lies, her family jeopardized and her best friend has disappeared. Hot on the trail of a serial killer, Detective Rocco Sterling, finds himself distracted by a woman who shares an uncanny resemblance to a lost love, not realizing their meeting is more than just coincidence until he finds her body in a dumpster across town. The deeper Kira digs the quicker her life unravels, leaving her fate resting insecurely in the hands of a stranger. Paths collide in a search for truth that grows deadlier at every turn, as the lines between right and wrong blur into an immoral mess of desire, betrayal and revenge. Caught between an ugly truth she doesn't want to face and a haunting reality to which she feels drawn, Kira must learn to trust her instincts and take life at The Candy Shop one bite size piece at a time.	312	November 10th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19107176-the-candy-shop
