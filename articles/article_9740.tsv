Keegan's Lady	Coulters Historical #1	Catherine Anderson	4.11	3909	207	Only Love Can Heal a Wounded Soul ... Caitlin O'Shannessy's late father left her with many things: a Colorado ranch, enduring memories of pain and sadness, an unshakable mistrust of men ... and an adversary. Ace Keegan has returned to No Name, too late to enact a rightful vengeance on his most hated enemy. The man who put a hole in Ace's life is dead, leaving a daughter behind to run the family enterprise. Though proud and strong as well as beautiful, Caitlin is caught off guard when Ace's calculated anger inadvertently destroys her good name. But Ace Keegan is a man of honor, determined to make amends by marrying the enchanting lady he wrongedâ€”and to nurture patience and love the light she guards in her damage heart until it blazes with the power of a thousand suns.	410	July 1996	Ace Keegan, Caitlin O'Shannessy	Colorado Territory (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89351.Keegan_s_Lady
