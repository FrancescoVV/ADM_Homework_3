Out of Ruins	From the Wreckage #2	Michele G. Miller	4.34	855	75	Guilt. A painful, lonely feeling. It seeps into your pores slowly as you go through life day by day. Like a disease, it blackens your heart with thoughts and memories of what you did, or in my case, what you didnâ€™t do. Surviving the storm was only the beginning for Jules. Surviving the guilt? That is something only love can help her overcome.		July 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32717123-out-of-ruins
