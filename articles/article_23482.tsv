The Sacred Romance Drawing Closer To The Heart Of God		John Eldredge, Brent Curtis	3.98	12306	333	The God who saves is also a God who woos His own to a relationship primarily of the heart. As we draw closer to Him, we must choose to let go of other "less-wild lovers," such as perfectionistic driveness and self-indulgence. Eldredge and Curtis identify the lies offered by "false loves" and instruct us on the journey back to the Lover of our souls.In carefully crafted words and images, the authors entice the reader to his or her own journey of the heart, promising, "It is possible to recover the lost life of our heart and with it the intimacy, beauty, and adventure of life with God."	228	May 14th 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126066.The_Sacred_Romance_Drawing_Closer_To_The_Heart_Of_God
