The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus		Richard Preston	4.12	98721	5347	A highly infectious, deadly virus from the central African rain forest suddenly appears in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. There is no cure. In a few days 90 percent of its victims are dead. A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic "hot" virus. The Hot Zone tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the appearance of rare and lethal viruses and their "crashes" into the human race. Shocking, frightening, and impossible to ignore, The Hot Zone proves that truth really is scarier than fiction.	352	December 1994		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16213.The_Hot_Zone
