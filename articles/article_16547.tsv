The Cricket on the Hearth	The Christmas Books #3	Charles Dickens	3.44	5443	668	Dickens gave his first formal expression to his Christmas thoughts in his series of small books, the first of which was the famous "Christmas Carol." There followed four others: "The Chimes," "The Cricket on the Hearth," "The Battle of Life," and "The Haunted Man." The five are known today as the "Christmas Books." Of them all the "Carol" is the best known and loved, and "The Cricket on the Hearth," although third in the series, is perhaps next in popularity, and is especially familiar to Americans through Joseph Jefferson's characterisation of Caleb Plummer. The title creature is a sort of barometer of life at the home of John Peerybingle and his much younger wife Dot. When things go well, the cricket on the hearth chirps; it is silent when there is sorrow. Tackleton, a jealous old man, poisons John's mind about Dot, but the cricket through its supernatural powers restores John's confidence and all ends happily.	84	1845	John Peerybingle, Mary Peerybingle (Dot), Caleb Plummer, Bertha Plummer, Tackleton, May Fielding, Mrs. Fielding, Tilly Slowboy	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/549938.The_Cricket_on_the_Hearth
