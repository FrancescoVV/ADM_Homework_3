An Object of Beauty		Steve Martin	3.72	68718	3084	Lacey Yeager is young, captivating, and ambitious enough to take the NYC art world by storm. Groomed at Sotheby's and hungry to keep climbing the social and career ladders put before her, Lacey charms men and women, old and young, rich and even richer with her magnetic charisma and liveliness. Her ascension to the highest tiers of the city parallel the soaring heights--and, at times, the dark lows--of the art world and the country from the late 1990s through today.	304	November 23rd 2010		New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7907803-an-object-of-beauty
