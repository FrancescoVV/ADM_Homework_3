Bitter Blood	The Morganville Vampires #13	Rachel Caine	4.24	13065	944	For years, the human and vampire residents of Morganville, Texas, have managed to co-exist in peace. But now that the threat to the vampires has been defeated, the human residents are learning that the gravest danger they face is the enemy within… Thanks to the eradication of the parasitic creatures known as the draug, the vampires of Morganville have been freed of their usual constraints. With the vampires indulging their every whim, the town’s human population is determined to hold on to their lives by taking up arms. But college student Claire Danvers isn’t about to take sides, considering she has ties to both the humans and the vampires. To make matters worse, a television show comes to Morganville looking for ghosts, just as vampire and human politics collide. Now, Claire and her friends have to figure out how to keep the peace without ending up on the nightly news… or worse.	404	October 24th 2012	Michael Glass, Shane Collins, Eve Rosser, Claire Danvers	Morganville, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414055-bitter-blood
