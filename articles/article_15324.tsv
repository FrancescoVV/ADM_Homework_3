A Man Called Blessed	The Caleb Books #2	Ted Dekker, Bill Bright	4.13	3283	135	One man holds the key to finding the Ark of the Covenant. In this explosive sequel to Blessed Child, Rebecca Soloman leads a team deep into the Ethiopian desert to hunt the one man who may know the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. But Islamic extremists fear that the Ark's discovery will compel Israel to rebuild Solomon's temple on the very site of their own holy mosque in Jerusalem. They immediately dispatch Ismael, their most accomplished assassin, to pursue the same man. But the one in their sights is no ordinary man. His name is Caleb, and he is also on a quest--to find again the love he embraced as a child.	368	September 2nd 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16275085-a-man-called-blessed
