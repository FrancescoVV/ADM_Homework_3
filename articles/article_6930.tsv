This sequel to The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty , the first of Anne Rice's (writing as A.N. Roquelaure) volumes of erotica, continues her explicit, teasing exploration of the psychology of human desire. Now Beauty, having indulged in a secret and forbidden infatuation with the rebellious slave Prince Tristan, is sent away from the Satyricon-like world of the Castle.

And once again Rice's tale of pleasure and pain dares to explore the most primal and well-hidden desires of the human heart. This series [predates the eroticism of E.L.
