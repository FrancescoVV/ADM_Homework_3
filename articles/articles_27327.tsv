Dragonworld ETC	The Society On Da Run	L'Poni Baldwin	4.00	4	1	In this e-chapbook are twelve poem-stories that serve as an introduction to the space dragon epic 'The Society On Da Run' (TBA 2011). These twelve (and more) poems and stories are diverse and offer up something new to the world of Dragons. Not much can be said because of how short it is.
