A Demon Made Me Do It	Demonblood #1	Penelope King	3.82	2250	275	Some girls share clothes, a bathroom, or a bedroom. Seventeen-year-old Liora Greyson has to share, too. Only she shares her body--with a demon. Liora just wants to survive her final year of high school unscathed, her dark secret intact. But the walls she’s carefully constructed to keep people away crack wide open once she meets the sexy and mysterious Kieron, and he lights her world on fire. She can’t let him know she transforms into a demon named "Lucky" at nightfall—a demon with an entirely separate personality who passes out Torment, Justice, and Revenge like Halloween candy. Turns out Kieron is the one who should be afraid once Lucky discovers his true identity and motivations. Liora wants to love him, but Lucky thinks he’s public enemy number one. And having a demon with a vendetta show up during a romantic date puts a serious crimp in any relationship. Fighting your demons is one thing. Having one that fights back, messes with your guy, and leaves you with nasty hangovers is quite another. Being bad has never been so good...	315	May 27th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12332964-a-demon-made-me-do-it
