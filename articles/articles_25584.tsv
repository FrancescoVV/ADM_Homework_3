Chasing the Rainbow: Facilitating a Pagan Festival		Tish Owen	4.11	9	1	Chasing The Rainbow is destined to become the quintessential guide for facilitating Pagan festivals. Author Tish Owen draws from over a decade of experience running one of the Mid-south's largest alternative spirituality gathering. In her down to earth and often humorous style, she offers sound advise and common sense planning techniques that will help to make any festival coordinator's job a pleasure rather than a pain - be it a small celebration or a large event on a regional scale.	192	May 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1480211.Chasing_the_Rainbow
