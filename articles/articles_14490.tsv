Six Moon Summer	Seasons of the Moon #1	S.M. Reine	3.83	4598	393	Rylie's been bitten. She's changing. And now she has three months to find a cure before becoming a werewolf... forever. Rylie Gresham hates everything about summer camp: the food, the fresh air, the dumb activities, and the other girls in her cabin. But the worst part is probably being bitten by a werewolf. Being a teenager is hard enough, but now she's craving raw flesh and struggles with uncontrollable anger. If she doesn't figure out a way to stop the transformation, then at the end of summer, her life is worse than over. She'll be a monster.	198	April 29th 2011	Rylie Gresham, Seth Wilder, Jessica Jean Gresham-Kirshner		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10803218-six-moon-summer
