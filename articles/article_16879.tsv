Period Piece: The Victorian Childhood of Charles Darwin's Granddaughter		Gwen Raverat	4.07	377	84	To celebrate 50 years in print, this is a special edition of this classic and much loved work. Gwen Raverat, the grand-daughter of Charles Darwin, described this memoir of her late Victorian Cambridge childhood as a drawing of the world when I was young. The observations of the small incidents in her life and of her eccentric Darwin family, recorded here both in her inimitably charming prose and her line drawings, reveal an artist's careful eye. Vividly evoking a bygone era, it is a shrewd, touching and comic portrait of her childhood, her eccentric relations, and of Cambridge academic society. The book's wit and charm have endeared it to several generations of avid readers and have ensured it is still in print some 50 years after it was first published.	272	1952			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1142005.Period_Piece
