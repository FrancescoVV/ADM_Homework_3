The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove	Pine Cove #2	Christopher Moore	3.87	31674	1384	The town psychiatrist has decided to switch everybody in Pine Cove, California, from their normal antidepressants to placebos, so naturally—well, to be accurate, artificially—business is booming at the local blues bar. Trouble is, those lonely slide-guitar notes have also attracted a colossal sea beast named Steve with, shall we say, a thing for explosive oil tanker trucks. Suddenly, morose Pine Cove turns libidinous and is hit by a mysterious crime wave, and a beleaguered constable has to fight off his own gonzo appetites to find out what's wrong and what, if anything, to do about it.	304	April 1st 1999	Theophilus (Theo) Crowe, Molly Michon, Gabe Fenton, Valerie Riordan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33458.The_Lust_Lizard_of_Melancholy_Cove
