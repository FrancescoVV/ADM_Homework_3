Rainelle: How to Kill an Incubus Bonus Chapter	Incubus #1.1	Kimber  Lee	4.67	106	4	She knew things normal people didn’t. She could feel evil lurking around her, but she couldn’t do anything about it. Too bad she wasn’t cut out to be a hunter like her father. If only she was stronger, she could’ve avenged her mother. She is willing to do everything…even seducing an incubus, if it’s the only way to satisfy her thirst for revenge. With a demon hunter’s blood running through her veins, Rainelle could only hope.	18	June 11th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25717278-rainelle
