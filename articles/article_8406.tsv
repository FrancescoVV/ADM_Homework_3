The Táin: From the Irish Epic Táin Bó Cúailnge		Anonymous, Thomas Kinsella, Louis Le Brocquy	3.97	3612	256	The Táin Bó Cúailnge , centre-piece of the eighth-century Ulster cycle of heroic tales, is Ireland's nearest approach to a great epic. It tells the story of a great cattle-raid, the invasion of Ulster by the armies of Medb and Ailill, queen and king of Connacht, and their allies, seeking to carry off the great Brown Bull of Cúailnge. The hero of the tale is Cúchulainn, the Hound of Ulster, who resists the invaders single-handed, while Ulster's warriors lie sick. Thomas Kinsella's presents a complete and living version of the story. His translation is based on the partial texts in two medieval manuscripts, with elements from other version, and adds a group of related stories which prepare for the action of the Táin . Illustrated with brush drawings by Louis le Brocquy, this edition provides a combination of medieval epic and modern art.	282	650	Cú Chulainn, Ailill mac Máta, Amergin mac Eccit, Bricriu, Cathbad, Cethern mac Fintain, Conall Cernach, Conchobar mac Nessa, Cormac Cond Longas, Cú Roí, Cúscraid, Dáire mac Fiachna, Donn Cuailnge, Dubthach Dóeltenga, Fedelm, Fedelm Noíchrothach, Ferdiad, Fergus mac Róich, Findabair, Finnbhennach, Flidais, Fráech, Garb mac Stairn, Láeg, Lugh, Maeve, Medb, The Morrígan, Nad Crantail, Nemain, Súaltam		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75586.The_T_in
