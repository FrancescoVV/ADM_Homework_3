Bel Canto		Ann Patchett	3.93	240604	15215	Somewhere in South America, at the home of the country's vice president, a lavish birthday party is being held in honor of the powerful businessman Mr. Hosokawa. Roxane Coss, opera's most revered soprano, has mesmerized the international guests with her singing. It is a perfect eveningâ€”until a band of gun-wielding terrorists takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different, a moment of great beauty, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people from different continents become compatriots, intimate friends, and lovers.	318	May 22nd 2001	Katsumi Hosokawa, Roxane Coss, Gen Watanabe, Carmen Lowell		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto
