Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds		Adrienne Maree Brown	4.34	3597	466	Inspired by Octavia Butler's explorations of our human relationship to change, Emergent Strategy is radical self-help, society-help, and planet-help designed to shape the futures we want to live. Change is constant. The world is in a continual state of flux. It is a stream of ever-mutating, emergent patterns. Rather than steel ourselves against such change, this book invites us to feel, map, assess, and learn from the swirling patterns around us in order to better understand and influence them as they happen. This is a resolutely materialist “spirituality” based equally on science and science fiction, a visionary incantation to transform that which ultimately transforms us. adrienne maree brown , co-editor of Octavia’s Brood: Science Fiction from Social Justice Movements , is a social justice facilitator, healer, and doula living in Detroit.	274	March 20th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29633913-emergent-strategy
