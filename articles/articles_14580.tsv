Wyvern		A.A. Attanasio	4.16	455	44	1609 was a time when navigation was more art than science, when the whole world was thought of as plunder. This is the time when Jaki Gefjon was born in the dark jungle of Borneo. A fair-skinned half-breed, Jaki is outcast as a devil child--until he emerges from the jungle and enters upon an epic adventure through violence, treachery, mysticism and love.	693	1988	Jaki Gefron, Lucinda Quarles, Trevor Pym		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201381.Wyvern
