The Ugly Duckling		Iris Johansen	4.08	12005	385	If fate suddenly made you more beautiful than you ever dreamed possible, would it be the beginning of a fairy tale, or your worst nightmare? The brutal attack should have killed anybody, but Nell Calder did more than survive. She emerged a woman transformed, with an exquisite beauty found only in fairy tales. Nell Calder deserved a happy ending. Instead, her descent into terror has just begun. Her attacker is still on the hunt, determined to finish what he's started. And Nell, protected by a new face, is just as determined to fight back and take her revenge. But to catch her prey, she will have to expose herselfâ€”even if it makes her a killer's prime target.	408	1994	Nell Calder, Nicholas Tanek, Paul Maritz, Philippe Gardeaux, Jamie Reardon, Tania Vlados		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122968.The_Ugly_Duckling
