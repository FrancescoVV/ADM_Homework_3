Musashi	Musashi #Complete	Eiji Yoshikawa, Charles Terry, Edwin O. Reischauer	4.46	15234	1043	The classic samurai novel about the real exploits of the most famous swordsman. Musashi is a novel in the best tradition of Japanese story telling. It is a living story, subtle and imaginative, teeming with memorable characters, many of them historical. Interweaving themes of unrequited love, misguided revenge, filial piety and absolute dedication to the Way of the Samurai, it depicts vividly a world Westerners know only vaguely.	970	1935	Miyamoto Musashi, Osugi Hon'iden, Otsu, Takuan, Matahachi Hon'iden, Jotaro Tanzaemon, Sasaki Kojiro	Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102030.Musashi
