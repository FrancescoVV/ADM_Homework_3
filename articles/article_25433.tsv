Wildcard: Volume One	Wildcard #1	Missy Johnson	3.79	985	216	246. That's the number of women I've shagged in the last twelve months. I'm Ryder Stevens. Don't pretend you don't know me. I'm a god. I'm hot, I'm British and I take what I want. I'm also the number one ranked tennis player in the world. But it's my off court antics that gain the most attention. I cruise through life, running from one scandal to the next. Hell I can't even take a piss without the world knowing about it. Rules? Who gives a shit? Rules are there to be broken and I'm the king of breaking them. But even the king can be bought to his knees. I'm sidelined with an injury that changes everything. Maybe my life isn't so perfect after all...	99	September 4th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22587069-wildcard
