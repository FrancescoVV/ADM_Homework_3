Wonder	Wonder #1	R.J. Palacio	4.43	740619	66263	I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. Wonder , begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others.	315	February 14th 2012	August Pullman, Olivia Pullman, Jack Will, Julian Albans, Summer Dawson, Miranda Navas, Nate Pullman, Isabel Pullman, Justin (Wonder), Charlotte Cody	Upper Manhattan, New York (United States), New York City, New York (United States), United States of America, New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11387515-wonder
