White Guilt		Hewitt E. Moore	3.94	18	5	A total resource blackout takes place in the heartland of America and Evan Roddenberry is prepared for the worst. The government's desire to disarm the nation's populace is put into effect with "Operation Cleansing." Heinous acts of violence against White Americans, transform a law abiding citizen into the nations most notorious death row inmate. White Guilt is controversial in its dealings with race, religion, illegal immigration, feminism, homosexuality, gun control, politics, and multiculturalism. It examines the truths in regard to how much we rely on media to inform, and how easily it can control the actions and thoughts of its audience. White Guilt is a page turning thriller, written by first time author Hewitt E. Moore. Mr. Moore is a talented writer, with an uniquely versatile writing style; as is evident with an impressive collection of poetry in the book's epilogue. Be prepared for an emotional roller coaster from the opening sentence to the final period in this thought provoking book.	177	2009	Evan Roddenberry, Rachelle	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6530808-white-guilt
