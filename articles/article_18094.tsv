Pulse	Pulse #1	Patrick Carman	3.63	5156	659	In the year 2051, who has a pulse? With the help of her mysterious classmate Dylan Gilmore, Faith Daniels discovers that she can move objects with her mind. This telekinetic ability is called a “pulse,” and Dylan has the talent, too. In riveting action scenes, Faith demonstrates her ability to use her pulse against a group of telekinesis masters who are so powerful they can flatten their enemies by uprooting streetlights, throwing boulders, and changing the course of a hurtling hammer so that it becomes a deadly weapon. But even with her unusual talent, the mind--and the heart--can be difficult to control. If Faith wants to join forces with Dylan and save the world, she’ll have to harness the power of both. Patrick Carman’s Pulse trilogy is a stunning and epic triumph about the power of the mind--and of love.	371	January 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14760527-pulse
