Leo the Late Bloomer		Robert Kraus, José Aruego	4.17	10234	597	This heartwarming story of how a little tiger named Leo bloomed is told by bestselling author Robert Kraus and is accompanied by the wonderfully bold illustrations of Jose Aruego. It's an excellent choice to share during homeschooling, in particular for children ages 4 to 6. It’s a fun way to learn to read and as a supplement for activity books for children. “Captivating and rollicking.” — The Horn Book Leo isn't reading, or writing, or drawing, or even speaking, and his father is concerned. But Leo's mother isn't. She knows her son will do all those things, and more, when he's ready. With its message of patience and humor, Leo the Late Bloomer is more timely than ever. As Children's Books and Their Creators commented: "Leo's reassuring 'I made it!' at the end delights young listeners who may have been scrutinized for early blooming by well-intentioned moms and dads. Deserves space on any parenting shelf."	32	1971			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225542.Leo_the_Late_Bloomer
