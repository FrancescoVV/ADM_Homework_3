The Gods She Chose		Liat Segal	4.21	14	2	You are what you worship… and what you don’t. In every aspect of her life, Ayala Silver feels the weight of human gods upon her. Teachers, friends, lovers, and even complete strangers—so many of the influences in her life come to function as mental bullies who Ayala feels she must appease. In this novel, we see Ayala through the eyes of those looming characters she carries inside, and witness her dance along the outer edges of sanity. Through the linked, compelling stories which make up The Gods She Chose, we glean the portrait of a mysterious and deeply enchanting woman.	146	February 9th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13639318-the-gods-she-chose
