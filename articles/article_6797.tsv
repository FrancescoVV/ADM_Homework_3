Beauty and Sadness		Yasunari Kawabata, Howard Hibbett	3.85	8249	761	Beauty and Sadness (Japanese: 美しさと哀しみと Utsukushisa to kanashimi to) is a 1964 novel by Japanese Nobel Prize winning author Yasunari Kawabata. Opening on the train to Kyoto, the narrative, in characteristic Kawabata fashion, subtly brings up issues of tradition and modernity as it explores writer Oki Toshio's reunion with a young lover from his past, Otoko Ueno, who is now a famous artist and recluse. Ueno is now living with her protegée and a jealous lover, Keiko Sakami, and the unfolding relationships between Oki, Otoko, and Keiko form the plot of the novel. Keiko states several times that she will avenge Otoko for Oki's abandonment, and the story coalesces into a climactic ending.	206	1964	Toshio Oki, Otoko Ueno, Fumiko Oki, Keiko Sakami, Taichiro Oki	Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14029.Beauty_and_Sadness
