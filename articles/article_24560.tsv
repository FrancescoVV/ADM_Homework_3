A Reasonable Response: Answers to Tough Questions on God, Christianity, and the Bible		William Lane Craig, Joseph E. Gorra	3.92	108	18	Followers of Jesus need not fear hard questions or objections against Christian belief. In A Reasonable Response , renowned Christian philosopher and apologist William Lane Craig offers dozens of examples of how some of the most common challenges to Christian thought can be addressed, including: Why does God allow evil? How can I be sure God exists? Why should I believe that the Bible is trustworthy? How does modern science relate to the Christian worldview? What evidence do we have that Jesus rose from the dead? Utilizing real questions submitted to his popular website ReasonableFaith.org, Dr. Craig models well-reasoned, skillful, and biblically informed interaction with his inquirers. A Reasonable Response goes beyond merely talking about apologetics; it shows it in action. With cowriter Joseph E. Gorra, this book also offers advice about envisioning and practicing the ministry of answering peopleâ€™s questions through the local church, workplace, and in online environments. Whether you're struggling to respond to tough objections or looking for answers to your own intellectual questions, A Reasonable Response will equip you with sound reasoning and biblical truth.	432	March 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15812696-a-reasonable-response
