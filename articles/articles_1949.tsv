The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight		Jennifer E. Smith	3.78	108822	10355	Who would have guessed that four minutes could change everything? Today should be one of the worst days of seventeen-year-old Hadley Sullivan's life. Having missed her flight, she's stuck at JFK airport and late to her father's second wedding, which is taking place in London and involves a soon-to-be stepmother Hadley's never even met. Then she meets the perfect boy in the airport's cramped waiting area. His name is Oliver, he's British, and he's sitting in her row. A long night on the plane passes in the blink of an eye, and Hadley and Oliver lose track of each other in the airport chaos upon arrival. Can fate intervene to bring them together once more? Quirks of timing play out in this romantic and cinematic novel about family connections, second chances, and first loves. Set over a twenty-four-hour-period, Hadley and Oliver's story will make you believe that true love finds you when you're least expecting it.	236	January 2nd 2012	Andrew Sullivan, Oliver, Hadley Sullivan	New York State (United States), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10798416-the-statistical-probability-of-love-at-first-sight
