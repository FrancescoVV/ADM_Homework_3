The Egg and I	Betty MacDonald Memoirs #1	Betty MacDonald	3.92	8197	865	When Betty MacDonald married a marine and moved to a small chicken farm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, she was largely unprepared for the rigors of life in the wild. With no running water, no electricity, a house in need of constant repair, and days that ran from four in the morning to nine at night, the MacDonalds had barely a moment to put their feet up and relax. And then came the children. Yet through every trial and pitfall—through chaos and catastrophe—this indomitable family somehow, mercifully, never lost its sense of humor. An immortal, hilarious and heartwarming classic about working a chicken farm in the Northwest, a part of which first appeared in a condensed serialization in the Atlantic monthly.	288	October 3rd 1945		Chimacum, Washington (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23770.The_Egg_and_I
