A Tree Grows in Brooklyn		Betty  Smith	4.27	389805	20791	The beloved American classic about a young girl's coming-of-age at the turn of the century, Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a poignant and moving tale filled with compassion and cruelty, laughter and heartache, crowded with life and people and incident. The story of young, sensitive, and idealistic Francie Nolan and her bittersweet formative years in the slums of Williamsburg has enchanted and inspired millions of readers for more than sixty years. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the daily experiences of the unforgettable Nolans are raw with honesty and tenderly threaded with family connectedness -- in a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as incredibly rich moments of universal experience.	496	August 18th 1943	Francie Nolan, Neeley Nolan, Katie Nolan, Johnny Nolan, Mary Rommely, Sissy Rommely, Eva "Evy" Rommely Flittman, Thomas Rommely, Sergeant McShane	Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York (United States), New York City, New York (United States), United States of America, New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14891.A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn
