Death in a Strange Country	Commissario Brunetti #2	Donna Leon	3.89	11428	798	Early one morning Commissario Guido Brunetti of the Venice Police confronts a grisly sight when the body of a young man is fished out of a fetid canal. All the clues point to a violent mugging, but for Brunetti the motive of robbery seems altogether too convenient. When something is discovered in the victimâ€™s apartment that suggests the existence of a high-level conspiracy, Brunetti becomes convinced that somebody, somewhere, is taking great pains to provide a ready-made solution to the crime.	373	January 1st 1993	Commissario Guido Brunetti, Doctor Ettore Rizzardi, Paola Brunetti, Deputy police chiefs Vice-Questore Patta, Chiara Brunetti	Venice (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48323.Death_in_a_Strange_Country
