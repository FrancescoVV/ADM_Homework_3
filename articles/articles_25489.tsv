Dark Lycan	Dark #21	Christine Feehan	4.37	9151	628	The erotic, gripping series that has defined an entire genre” (J. R. Ward) continues as #1 New York Times bestselling author Christine Feehan links the fates of two strangers bound by a secret in the shadows of the Carpathian Mountains… Tatijana of the Dragonseekers spent centuries encased in ice with her sister, trapped in limbo between life and death, never speaking to a soul other than those who tormented her. Now, she has been freed from her frozen prison by an unknown descendent. Awakened in human form, Tatijana yearns to explore the modern world in which she now lives—a world with more mysteries than she is prepared for. Fenris Dalka has returned to the Carpathian Mountains after a long absence to be with his brother. He is scarred by centuries of battle, and every hard-won victory. But the real reason for his return home could prove deadly if discovered by the wrong man—or woman. Upon his arrival, he is compelled by a beautiful and enigmatic stranger who carries the scent of fresh earth, of forest, of the night itself. In time Tatijana and Fenris will discover all that unites them—their secrets and pasts, their predators, and the hot flush of passion that stirs their souls. Yet just as surely, seduced into the silvery darkness of a full-moon night, they’ll also discover everything ancient and evil that exists to destroy them.	326	2012	Mikhail Dubrinsky, Raven Whitney, Shea O'Halloran, Jacques Dubrinsky, Natalya Shonski, Vikirnoff VonShrieder, Savannah Raven Dubrinsky, Gregori Daratrazanoff, Nicolae VonShrieder, Traian Trigovise, Joie Sanders, Tatijana Dragonseeker, Skyler Rose Thompson-Daratrazanoff, Zev Hunter, Sara Marten, Falcon Amiras, Dimitri Tirunul, Gary Jansen, Jubal Sanders, Anastashia Daratrazanoff, Anya Daratrazanoff, Lojos, Branislava Dragonseeker, Fenris Dalka, Tomas (Dark Slayer), Travis (Dark Dream), Mataias, Alexandru Dubrinsky, Arnou, Blythe (Dark Carpathians), Chrissy (Dark Dream), Convel, Costin Eliade, Daciana, Drummel, Emma (Dark Carpathians), Enre, Gellert, Gunnolf, Jase (Dark Carpathians), Lucas (Dark Dream), Lykaon, Makoce, Peter (Dark Lycan), Stefan Kane Dubrinsky, Abel (Dark Lycan), Bardolf, Marrock (Dark Lycan), Vitrona, Destiny VonShrieder		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17412093-dark-lycan
