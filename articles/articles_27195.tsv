Ten Things I Hate About Me		Randa Abdel-Fattah	3.60	3723	483	Randa Abdel-Fattah's new novel about finding your place in life . . . and learning to accept yourself and your culture. At school I'm Aussie-blonde Jamie -- one of the crowd. At home I'm Muslim Jamilah -- driven mad by my Stone Age dad. I should win an Oscar for my acting skills. But I can't keep it up for much longer... Jamie just wants to fit in. She doesn't want to be seen as a stereotypical Muslim girl, so she does everything possible to hide that part of herself. Even if it means pushing her friends away because she's afraid to let them know her dad forbids her from hanging out with boys or that she secretly loves to play the darabuka (Arabic drums).	320	October 1st 2006		Australia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1035021.Ten_Things_I_Hate_About_Me
