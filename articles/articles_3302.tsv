Raven's Gate	The Power of Five #1	Anthony Horowitz	3.90	23830	1433	He always knew he was different. First there were the dreams. Then the deaths began. When Matt Freeman gets into trouble with the police, he's sent to be fostered in Yorkshire. It's not long before he senses there's something wrong with his guardian; with the whole village. Then Matt learns about the Old Ones and begins to understand just how he is different. But no one will believe him; no one can help. There is no proof. There is no logic. There is just the Gate.	270	January 1st 2005	Richard Cole, Matt Freeman, Jayne Deverill	Yorkshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107664.Raven_s_Gate
