With a Single Spell	Ethshar #2	Lawrence Watt-Evans	4.05	1821	80	A SINGLE SPELL Tobas had been lucky to find a wizard to take him on as apprentice. But then the wizard died suddenly and unexpectedly after teaching Tobas only a solitary spell, and the youth was too old to find a new master. How could he earn a living when all the magic he could do was light fires? A DESTINY UNFOLDING In the Small Kingdoms there were dragons to be slain, princesses and gold to be won, magic castles, witches who knew the secret of immortality, and other treasures. But how could a wizard with a single, simple spell hope to find them and win them?	208	1987	Tobas		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320216.With_a_Single_Spell
