It's Not What You Think (It's Not What You Think, #1)		Ashley Waelti	4.27	15	5	Gehenna, New York. It was the type of place where dreams were damned to die. As a longtime resident, Cora Gottlieb knew this first hand. Despite being gifted pianist, her hopes of getting into the New York Philharmonic were always dashed. Cora wasn't the only miserable resident of the gloomy town, though. It seemed as if everyone lacked the capacity to feel happiness. At least permanent happiness, that is. Family and friends all got lost in the daily humdrum of life. There was no escape. Could it be that something far more sinister was in the country air? Or was this all really just the result of living in a tired town? Find out what's at play, when you follow Cora and her friends on journey with plenty of twist and turns. Just remember, it's not what you think.	248	January 2nd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20497446-it-s-not-what-you-think
