The Stranger I Married		Sylvia Day	3.87	13503	820	The unabridged, downloadable audiobook edition of Sylvia Day’s The Stranger I married, a tale of ambition, love and lust. Read by the actress Imogen Church. They are London’s most scandalous couple. Isabel, Lady Pelham, and Gerard Faulkner, Marquess of Grayson, are well matched in all things - lusty appetites, constant paramours, provocative reputations, and their absolute refusal to ruin a marriage of convenience by falling in love. It is a most agreeable sham - until a shocking event sends Gerard from her side. When, four years later, Gerard returns, the boyish rogue is now a powerful, irresistible man determined to seduce Isabel. He is not the man she married - but is he the one to finally steal her heart? ©2013 Sylvia Day (P)2013 Penguin Publishers Limited	312	January 1st 2007	Gerard Faulkner, Isabel Pelham	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22522998-the-stranger-i-married
