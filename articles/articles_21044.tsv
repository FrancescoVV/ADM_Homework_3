Landscape Painted with Tea		Milorad Pavić, Christina Pribićević-Zorić	4.02	1411	70	By the author of the highly acclaimed literary bestseller Dictionary of the Khazars, this is a tale of a mysterious quest that is part modern Odyssey and part crossword puzzle. It begins with the story of a brilliant but failed architect in Belgrade and his search for his father, an officer who vanished in Greece during World War II. The truth about his fate--some of it set in motion 2,000 years ago and some of it by the Nazis--is raveled in the history and secrets of Mount Athos, the most ancient of all monasteries, perched atop its inaccessible mountain on the Aegean. "A hugely ambitious, playful, inventive, demanding, magical, linguistically sensuous reading experience."-- The Washington Post "A brilliantly playful and haunting novel."-- The New York Times Book Review	352	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223313.Landscape_Painted_with_Tea
