A Room with a View		E.M. Forster	3.91	152291	5737	"But you do," he went on, not waiting for contradiction. "You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it ..." Lucy has her rigid, middle-class life mapped out for her, until she visits Florence with her uptight cousin Charlotte, and finds her neatly ordered existence thrown off balance. Her eyes are opened by the unconventional characters she meets at the Pension Bertolini: flamboyant romantic novelist Eleanor Lavish, the Cockney Signora, curious Mr Emerson and, most of all, his passionate son George. Lucy finds herself torn between the intensity of life in Italy and the repressed morals of Edwardian England, personified in her terminally dull fianc√© Cecil Vyse. Will she ever learn to follow her own heart?	119	1908	Lucy Honeychurch, Charlotte Bartlett, George Emerson, Mr. Emerson, Rev. Arthur Beebe, Eleanor Lavish, Cecil Vyse, Freddy Honeychurch, Rev.
