Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books		Azar Nafisi	3.61	118768	7666	Every Thursday morning for two years in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a bold and inspired teacher named Azar Nafisi secretly gathered seven of her most committed female students to read forbidden Western classics. As Islamic morality squads staged arbitrary raids in Tehran, fundamentalists seized hold of the universities, and a blind censor stifled artistic expression, the girls in Azar Nafisi's living room risked removing their veils and immersed themselves in the worlds of Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Vladimir Nabokov. In this extraordinary memoir, their stories become intertwined with the ones they are reading. Reading Lolita in Tehran is a remarkable exploration of resilience in the face of tyranny and a celebration of the liberating power of literature.	356	March 25th 2003	Azar Nafisi, Nassrin, Manna, Mahshid, Yassi, Azin, Mitra (Reading Lolita in Teheran), Sanaz, Nima (Reading Lolita in Teheran), Bijan	Iran, Islamic Republic of, Tehran (Iran)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7603.Reading_Lolita_in_Tehran
