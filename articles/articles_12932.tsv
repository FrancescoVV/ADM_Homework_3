A Rose for Her Grave and Other True Cases	Crime Files #1	Ann Rule	4.04	4016	138	Ann Rule's Crime Files books have delivered the very best in true crime reading since A Rose for Her Grave, first in the acclaimed series, made its debut. Distinguished by the former Seattle policewoman's razor-sharp eye for telling detail and her penetrating analysis of the criminal mind, this gripping collection of accounts drawn from her personal files features the twisting case of Randy Roth, who married -- and murdered -- for profit. In her trademark narrative style, Ann Rule weaves a tale that is riveting, enraging, and heartbreaking all at once, and brilliantly chronicles the fateful confluence of a killer and his female victims, as well as the shattering investigation into Roth's heinous crimes.	528	August 1st 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239830.A_Rose_for_Her_Grave_and_Other_True_Cases
