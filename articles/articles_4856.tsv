Rashōmon and Seventeen Other Stories		Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jay Rubin, Haruki Murakami, Yoshihiro Tatsumi	4.14	6236	390	This collection features a brilliant new translation of the Japanese master's stories, from the source for the movie Rashōmon to his later, more autobiographical writings. Ryūnosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) is one of Japan’s foremost stylists - a modernist master whose short stories are marked by highly original imagery, cynicism, beauty and wild humour. ‘ Rashōmon ’ and ‘ In a Bamboo Grove ’ inspired Kurosawa’s magnificent film and depict a past in which morality is turned upside down, while tales such as ‘ The Nose ’, ‘ O-Gin ’ and ‘ Loyalty ’ paint a rich and imaginative picture of a medieval Japan peopled by Shoguns and priests, vagrants and peasants. And in later works such as ‘ Death Register ’, ‘ The Life of a Stupid Man ’ and ‘ Spinning Gears ’, Akutagawa drew from his own life to devastating effect, revealing his intense melancholy and terror of madness in exquisitely moving impressionistic stories.
