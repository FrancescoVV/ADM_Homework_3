And the Sun Always Sets		Danny Odato	4.48	66	45	The World Indifferent Is Watching... Mariyum tells the story of her life in a small Pakistani village, of her love of books and learning, and the challenges of living with a father who has given up on his family's future. But the harsh reality of her world suddenly emerges, and she and her soul mate, Faisal, must embark on a journey to escape the corruption and oppression of their community-to live by their own merits and on their own terms. Their path is full of treachery, deceit, and more obstacles than they imagined, and they soon discover that it may not be their destiny to live by their own decisions in this modern world. In And the Sun Always Sets, a suspenseful and romantic tale, Mariyum and Faisal eventually decide to take desperate measures in order to be together...no matter what the cost.	190	April 10th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21914422-and-the-sun-always-sets
