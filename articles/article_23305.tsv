The Gemel Ring		Betty Neels	4.13	298	26	Sister Charity Dawson loved her job but there was one problem. Like the other humble members of St. Simon's nursing staff, she had to put up with the arrogant Dr. Everard van Tijlen. When Charity apparently discovered that the distinguished doctor's exorbitant fees funded a playboy lifestyle, she hit the roof. Everard might well have an engaging boyish smile, but he needed to be taken down a peg or two. And Charity knew just how to do it.	224	1974	Abigail Trent, Dominic van Wijkelen, Charity Dawson, Everard van Tijlen		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/781226.The_Gemel_Ring
