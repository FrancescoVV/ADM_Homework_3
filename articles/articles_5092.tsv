Sweet Filthy Boy	Wild Seasons #1	Christina Lauren	4.11	36380	3480	One-night stands are supposed to be with someone convenient, or wickedly persuasive, or regrettable. They aren’t supposed to be with someone like him. But after a crazy Vegas weekend celebrating her college graduation—and terrified of the future path she knows is a cop-out—Mia Holland makes the wildest decision of her life: follow Ansel Guillaume—her sweet, filthy fling—to France for the summer and just…play. When feelings begin to develop behind the provocative roles they take on, and their temporary masquerade adventures begin to feel real, Mia will have to decide if she belongs in the life she left because it was all wrong, or in the strange new one that seems worlds away.	418	May 13th 2014	Mia Holland, Ansel Guillaume	San Diego, California (United States), Paris (France), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775297-sweet-filthy-boy
