The Legend of Sleepy Hollow		Washington Irving	3.73	50817	3420	Ichabod Crane, a schoolteacher, came to Tarry Town in the glen of Sleepy Hollow to ply his trade in educating young minds. He was a gullible and excitable fellow, often so terrified by locals' stories of ghosts that he would hurry through the woods on his way home, singing to keep from hysterics. Until late one night, he finds that maybe they're not just stories. What is that dark, menacing figure riding behind him on a horse? And what does it have in its hands? And why wasn't schoolteacher Crane ever seen in Sleepy Hollow again?	108	1820	Ichabod Crane, Katrina Van Tassel, Baltus Van Tassel, Abraham "Brom Bones" Van Brunt	Tarrytown, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93261.The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow
