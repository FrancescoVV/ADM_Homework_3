A Place Called Home	A Place Called Home #1	Lori Wick	4.06	3036	84	As the dim lights of the train station faded, Christine Bennett wondered if she would ever see home again. With the death of her grandfather, Christine experienced a deep loneliness she'd never felt before. The words of his will rang in her ears: "In the event of my granddaughter's death, everything will go to Vince Jeffers." Jeffers watched her with an evil look that made her shiver. Now, afraid of what might happen, she was obeying a note she had received saying she was in danger and must leave town immediately. After escaping to the community of Baxter, Christine begins to piece together a new life. The love she finds there, along with newfound faith, sustains her as she faces the threat of danger.	252	1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/289737.A_Place_Called_Home
