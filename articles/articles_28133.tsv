Old School	Diary of a Wimpy Kid #10	Jeff Kinney	4.32	40775	2759	Life was better in the old days. Or was it? That’s the question Greg Heffley is asking as his town voluntarily unplugs and goes electronics-free. But modern life has its conveniences, and Greg isn’t cut out for an old-fashioned world. With tension building inside and outside the Heffley home, will Greg find a way to survive? Or is going “old school” just too hard for a kid like Greg?	224	November 3rd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25222064-old-school
