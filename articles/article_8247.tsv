Something Like Summer	Something Like #1	Jay Bell	4.07	9225	1159	Love, like everything in the universe, cannot be destroyed. But over time it can change. The hot Texas nights were lonely for Ben before his heart began beating to the rhythm of two words; Tim Wyman. By all appearances, Tim had the perfect body and ideal life, but when a not-so-accidental collision brings them together, Ben discovers that the truth is rarely so simple. If winning Timâ€™s heart was an impossible quest, keeping it would prove even harder as family, society, and emotion threaten to tear them apart. Something Like Summer is a love story spanning a decade and beyond as two boys discover what it means to be friends, lovers, and sometimes even enemies.	293	January 1st 2010	Tim Wyman, Benjamin Bentley, Jace Holden, Allison Cross	Texas (United States), Houston, Texas (United States), Chicago, Illinois (United States), Illinois , 1999 (United States), Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10213367-something-like-summer
