A Perfect Darkness	Offspring #1	Jaime Rush	3.61	931	89	They live ordinary lives, but they are extraordinary. They are the Offspring, children of a mysterious experiment gone awry—and they are in terrible danger. A sexy stranger awakens Amy Shane in the dead of night. Lucas Vanderwyck barely has time to whisper a few words before three men burst into her bedroom and drag him away. But what Lucas reveals shatters Amy's safe little world forever. Lucas and Amy share a psychic gift—a gift that could put them in mortal danger. And as they share night after night of savage passion, as a shadowy government conspiracy tracks their every move, they will fight to save each other. But only with their powers of second sight can they escape the terror of a perfect darkness.	368	January 21st 2009	Amy Shane, Lucas Vanderwyck, Eric Aruda, Petra Aruda, Randall Brandenburg, Gerard Darkwell	Annapolis, Maryland (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5205697-a-perfect-darkness
