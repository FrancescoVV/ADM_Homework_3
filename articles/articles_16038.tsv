Samson's Lovely Mortal	Scanguards Vampires #1	Tina Folsom	3.93	17000	1022	Vampire bachelor Samson can't get it up anymore. Not even his shrink can help him. That changes when the lovely mortal auditor Delilah tumbles into his arms after a seemingly random attack. Suddenly there's nothing wrong with his hydraulics - that is, as long as Delilah is the woman in his arms. His scruples about taking Delilah to bed vanish when his shrink suggests it's the only way to cure his problem. Thinking all he needs is one night with her, Samson indulges in a night of pleasure and passion. However, another attack on Delilah and a dead body later, and Samson has his hands full: not only with trying to hide the fact he's a vampire, but also with finding out what secrets Delilah harbors for somebody to want her harm.	262	January 8th 2010	Delilah Sheridan, Samson Woodford	San Francisco, California (United States), California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18623052-samson-s-lovely-mortal
