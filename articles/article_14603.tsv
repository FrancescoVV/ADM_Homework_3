His Captive Lady	Devil Riders #2	Anne Gracie	3.96	1788	132	No one can resist the Devil Riders: four war heroes in search of one good woman. Harry Morant's tough exterior hides a badly scarred heart. The natural son of an earl, high-born ladies have only one use for him—in the bedchamber. Now, after eight years at war, Harry is breeding racehorses and planning a practical, unemotional marriage. But when he buys a new estate, his careful plans are threatened by an unexpected passion for—of all things—an earl's daughter.	323	2008	Harry Morant, Lady Helen Freymore	Hampshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3082951-his-captive-lady
