An Invite: All guests are not welcome		Mahima Yadav	5.00	2	0	“Atithi Devo Bhava” A very common phrase saying Guests are equivalent to ‘GOD’. They are always welcomed with warmth. But recall your last feeling when an unwanted guest appeared at your door or you had to drop your plans due to some uninvited guests. You must have felt like kicking them out of your home but nothing in your reach.While she was reading the book strange things were happening at the back. Some sort of shadow could be noticed in the room but Diana was so lean in reading that she couldn’t notice anything. After about two hours, Diana started feeling sleepy so she decided to sleep and continue reading the next day. She stood to have a glass of water. When she forwarded her step ahead, noticed a shadow behind her on the floor which was also moving with her step. For a moment, she got scared and started to look all around.Ah! The window was open and she assumed the lights from outside were coming and curtain along with her shadow was forming that image on the floor. If Maria would be there she would have definitely died of fear thinking it an evil.Diana gave a smile to herself ignoring the same. Closed the window, had water and got comfortable into her quilt closing eyes. As she closed her eyes, beside her the other part of the quilt moved up slowly like someone lifted it up and entered into it lying on the bed next to Diana. The clock in her room stopped like it didn’t want to disturb Diana’s sleep with its voice of “Tick-Tock”. She had no idea of all this as by the time Diana was in deep sleep unaware of anything happening all around her. Was it that uninvited guest or something else? No one knew who was soon going to enter their life from whom everyone wanted to escape but it was there to remain with them like a scary truth.	77	April 5th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44798557-an-invite
