This Immortal		Roger Zelazny	3.93	10183	396	Conrad Nomikos has a long, rich personal history that he'd rather not talk about. And, as Arts Commissioner, he's been given a job he'd rather not do. Escorting an alien grandee on a guided tour of the shattered remains of Earth is not something he relishes- especially when it is apparent that this places him at the center high-level intrigue that has some bearing on the future of Earth itself.	216	1966			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13827.This_Immortal
