Undead and Unwed	Undead #1	MaryJanice Davidson	3.82	53121	2744	It'a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she's killed in a car accident. But what really bites (besides waking up in the morgue dressed in a pink suit and cheap shoes courtesy of her stepmother) is that she can't seem to stay dead. Every night she rises with a horrible craving for blood. She's not taking too well to a liquid diet. Worst of all, her new friends have the ridiculous idea that Betsy is the prophesied vampire queen, and they want her help in overthrowing the most obnoxious, power-hungry vampire in five centuries - a badly dressed Bela Lugosi wannabe, natch. Frankly, Betsy couldn't care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no? But a collection of Ferragamos isn't the only temptation for Betsy. It's just a lot safer than the scrumptious Sinclair - a seductive bloodsucker whose sexy gaze seems as dangerous as a stake through the heart...	255	March 2nd 2004	Tina, Elizabeth "Betsy" Taylor, Eric Sinclair, Alicia, Nostros, Nick Berry, Dr. Marc Spangler, Jessica Watson	Minneapolis, Minnesota (United States), Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/421129.Undead_and_Unwed
