Memories, Dreams, Reflections		C.G. Jung, Aniela Jaffé, Richard Winston, Clara Winston	4.15	26331	781	In the spring of 1957, when he was eighty-one years old, C. G. Jung undertook the telling of his life story. At regular intervals he had conversations with his colleague and friend Aniela Jaffé, and collaborated with her in the preparation of the text based on these talks. On occasion, he was moved to write entire chapters of the book in his own hand, and he continued to work on the final stages of the manuscript until shortly before his death on June 6, 1961.	430	January 1st 1961	Carl Gustav Jung		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/612188.Memories_Dreams_Reflections
