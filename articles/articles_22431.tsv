Winter in Eden	West of Eden #2	Harry Harrison, Bill Sanderson	3.85	1638	29	Harry Harrison, an acknowledged master of imaginative fiction, broke new ground with "West of Eden." He brought to vivid life the world as it might have been, where dinosaurs survived, where their intelligent descendants challenged humans for mastery of Earth, where a young hunter named Kerrick grew among the dinosaurs and rose to become their most feared enemy. Now, the awesome saga continues in "Winter in Eden..." A new ice age threatens Earth. Facing extinction, the dinosaurs must employ their mastery of biology to swiftly reconquer human territory. Desperately, Kerrick launches an arduous quest to rally a final defense for humankind. With his beloved wife and young son, he heads north to the land of the whale hunters, east into the enemy's stronghold, and south to a fateful reckoning with destiny. Not since "Dune" has there been a work of such majestic scope and conception -- a monumental epic of passion, courage, and triumph.	416	1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/432162.Winter_in_Eden
