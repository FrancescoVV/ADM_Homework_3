Cracked Up to Be		Courtney Summers	3.74	16579	1804	When "Perfect" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter's High goes on alert. How has the cheerleading captain, girlfriend of the most popular guy in school, consummate teacher's pet, and future valedictorian fallen so far from grace? Parker doesn't want to talk about it. She'd just like to be left alone, to disappear, to be ignored. But her parents have placed her on suicide watch and her conselors are demanding the truth. Worse, there's a nice guy falling in love with her and he's making her feel things again when she'd really rather not be feeling anything at all. Nobody would have guessed she'd turn out like this. But nobody knows the truth. Something horrible has happened, and it just might be her fault.	240	December 23rd 2008	Parker Fadley, Jake Gardner, Ms. Grey, Chris Ellory	Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45046784-cracked-up-to-be
