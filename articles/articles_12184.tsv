The King's Blood	The Dagger and the Coin #2	Daniel Abraham	4.00	11595	551	The sequel to the acclaimed series launch, The Dragonâ€™s Path, is the perfect summer read for fans of George R. R. Martin. War casts its shadow over the lands that the dragons once ruled. Only the courage of a young woman with the mind of a gambler and loyalty to no one stands between hope and universal darkness. The high and powerful will fall, the despised and broken shall rise up, and everything will be remade. And quietly, almost beneath the notice of anyone, an old, broken-hearted warrior and an apostate priest will begin a terrible journey with an impossible goal: destroy a Goddess before she eats the world.	501	May 3rd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12759057-the-king-s-blood
