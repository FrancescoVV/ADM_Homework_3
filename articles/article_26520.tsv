Too Many Blooms	Petal Pushers #1	Catherine R. Daly	4.05	238	20	Four sisters. One family-owned flower shop. Endless opportunities for fun...or disaster! This fresh new series is full of girl--and flower--power. Delphinium "Del" Bloom loves her grandparents' flower shop, where it's always peaceful and calm--unlike her cluttered house, where her three sisters--Rose, Aster, and Poppy--constantly cause drama. But then Gran and Gramps move away and leave the flower shop in the care of Del's scatterbrained parents! Their first order is for a big wedding and the bride wants everything--especially the flowers--to be PERFECT. Worse, the mean girl in Del's class happens to be a junior bridesmaid! Can Del help her family and save the day?	192	March 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9083904-too-many-blooms
