Love You Forever		Robert Munsch, Sheila McGraw	4.36	203404	5275	An extraordinarily different story by Robert Munsch is a gentle affirmation of the love a parent feels for their child--forever. Sheila McGraw's soft and colorful pastels perfectly complement the sentiment of the book--one that will be read repeatedly for years.	32	January 1st 1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/310259.Love_You_Forever
