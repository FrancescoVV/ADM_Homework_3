Blood Bound	Unbound #1	Rachel Vincent	3.84	6461	804	Bound by blood, condemned by fate As a bloodtracker, Liv is extremely powerful. And in a world where power is a commodity that can get you killed, Liv's learnt to survive by her own rules. Rule number one? Trust no one. But when a friend's daughter goes missing, Liv is bound by a potent magical oath. She can't rest until the child is safe. And that means trusting her dangerous ex, Cam. A sinister prophecy tells that she and Cam will be the death of each other, yet Liv's tired of being a slave to destiny. She's ready to play the forces controlling her world at their own game. No matter what the cost.	463	September 1st 2011	Olivia Warren, Cam Caballero, Kori Daniels, Jake Tower, Ruben Cavazos, Anne Lawson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12096557-blood-bound
