Quest for Love: True Stories of Passion and Purity		Elisabeth Elliot	4.19	1663	77	I have deep feelings for this guy, but he says I'm like a sister to him. What should I do?" "Why should a man still be expected to initiate romance?" "Isn't it okay to spend time together if we're just friends?" "If I never marry, will God take that desire away?" These are some of the many questions posed in letters to Elisabeth Elliot by readers of her bestselling book "Passion and Purity." In this beautifully repackaged edition of "Quest for Love," she responds with sound, biblical guidance, dusting off "antiquated" concepts such as commitment, integrity, honor, and servanthood, and showing how they still apply to dating and singleness today. Intertwined are hopeful true stories of discovering love through God's direction.	256	1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126137.Quest_for_Love
