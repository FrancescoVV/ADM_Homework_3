The Long Winter	Little House #6	Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams	4.14	78355	1863	On the empty winter prairie, gray clouds to the northwest meant only one thing: a blizzard was seconds away. The first blizzard came in October. It snowed almost without stopping until April. The temperature dropped to forty below. Snow reached the roof-tops. And no trains could get through with food and coal. The townspeople began to starve. The Ingalls family barely lived through that winter. And Almanzo Wilder knew he would have to risk his life to save the town.	422	1940	Laura Ingalls Wilder, Caroline Quiner Ingalls, Charles Ingalls, Mary Ingalls, Carrie Ingalls, Grace Ingalls, Almanzo Wilder	De Smet, South Dakota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8282.The_Long_Winter
