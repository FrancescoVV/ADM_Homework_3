Surrender		Sonya Hartnett	3.65	2062	289	"Sophisticated young readers will be awed by the delicate, measured, heartbreaking portrait that emerges." - Kirkus Reviews (starred review) As life slips away, Gabriel looks back over his brief twenty years, which have been clouded by frustration and humiliation. A small, unforgiving town and distant, punitive parents ensure that he is never allowed to forget the horrific mistake he made as a child. He has only two friends - his dog, Surrender, and the unruly wild boy, Finnigan, a shadowy doppelganger with whom the meek Gabriel once made a boyhood pact. But when a series of arson attacks grips the town, Gabriel realizes how unpredictable and dangerous Finnigan is. As events begin to spiral violently out of control, it becomes devastatingly clear that only the most extreme measures will rid Gabriel of Finnigan for good.	248	January 1st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/476875.Surrender
