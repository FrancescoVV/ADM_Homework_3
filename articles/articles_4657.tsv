Vigilante	Vigilante #1	Claude Bouchard	3.80	1694	191	Montreal . . . the long, hot summer of 1996. . . . . . and in the dark of night, moving like a shadowy wraith, a vigilante prowls the city's streets. The targets of his bloody rampage: the worst of the worst. Murderers. Gangbangers. Rapists. Six months. Sixteen murders. The harried police are still without a clue . . . . . . until the day they receive an email from the assassin himself. Lieutenant Dave McCall, head of Montreal's Special Homicide Task Force, needs help to crack the secrets of the killer's taunting message. He calls on an expert--Chris Barry, who runs a security firm specializing in computer communications. Together, McCall and Barry launch a grim quest to track down a man who preys on predators--an urgent quest to bring this remorseless killer to justice. But whose justice will prevail: theirs--or the vigilante's?	252	2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6702002-vigilante
