Justified: The Story Of Caterrious Mitchell		Thomas J.	4.86	7	1	Growing up in the hardened streets of Newport News, Virginia, Caterrious Mitchell, is an exceptional teenager who excels in school, avoids conflict and works part-time job to support his growing family. However, when Caterrious is mistaken for a criminal on the run, it sets in motion a sequence of events that not only shakes his faith in the justice system but challenges legal precedent and turns the city against itself. More importantly, ‘The story of Caterrious Mitchell’ raises a question, if a persons’ life is legitimate danger, does he have a right to defend himself, even if that person wears a badge? “Every page of ‘Justified’ is so emotional and powerful that it will keep you salivating for just one more chapter”	265	February 1st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43833982-justified
