The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock and Other Poems		T.S. Eliot	4.32	18843	284	Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels.	44	1915			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118389.The_Love_Song_of_J_Alfred_Prufrock_and_Other_Poems
