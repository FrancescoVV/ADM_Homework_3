Sway of the Siren		Laurie McCall	4.50	12	1	When the body of a white woman who appears to have been beaten to death is discovered in the middle of a sweet potato patch, fear and suspicion grip Goethe Island, the last remaining untouched Gullah community off the coast of Beaufort, South Carolina. The residents, who are fighting to save their way of life, worry about outside interference and the bad publicity a possible murder will bring to their ancestral home. As the investigation begins, a love story emerges as those closest to the dead woman recount their connection to her. The detective discovers a manuscript containing clues to the woman’s heart. The blurb reads: Maya Indigo, tired of waltzing her way around the dance floor with an imaginary partner, becomes enticed and enveloped by the Sway of the Siren, discovering a new rhythm that mysteriously matches the beat of her own heart, releasing her from her orbit to spin and twirl and laugh and dance—really dance. She soon discovers her newfound freedom comes with shackles that she wears like priceless bands of gold. In the end, it’s only the redemption song of her true love that can carry her back home.	213	December 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26811166-sway-of-the-siren
