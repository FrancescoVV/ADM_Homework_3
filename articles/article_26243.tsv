Collected Short Stories: Volume 1	Collected Short Stories of W. Somerset Maugham #1	W. Somerset Maugham	4.34	1867	102	This first volume of Somerset Maugham's collected short stories includes the famous story 'Rain', the tragedy of the prudish missionary Mr Davidson and Sadie Thompson, the prostitute. The collection contains thirty stories that take us from the islands of the Pacific Ocean to England, France and Spain. They all reveal Maugham's acute and often sardonic observation of human foibles and his particular genius for exposing the bitter reality of human relationships. Somerset Maugham learnt his craft from Maupassant, and these stories display the remarkable talent that made him an unsurpassed storyteller.	448	1951			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150549.Collected_Short_Stories
