Clear and Present Danger	Jack Ryan #5	Tom Clancy	4.11	131545	842	Colombian drug lords, bored with Uncle Sam's hectoring, assassinate the head of the FBI. The message is clear: Bug off! At what point do these druggies threaten national security? When can a nation act against its enemies? These are questions Jack Ryan must answer because someone has quietly stepped over the line. Does anyone know who the real enemy is? How much action is too much? Which lines have been crossed? Ryan and his "dark side", a shadowy field officer known only as Mr. Clark, are charged with finding out. They expect danger from without... but the danger from within may be the greatest of all.	688	August 17th 1989	Dr. John "Jack" Patrick Ryan, John Clark	Colombia, Washington, D.C.
