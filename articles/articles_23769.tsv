Loving a Lost Lord	The Lost Lords #1	Mary Jo Putney	3.71	4888	431	In the first of a dazzling series, Mary Jo Putney introduces the Lost Lords--maverick childhood friends with a flair for defying convention. Each is about to discover the woman who is his perfect match--but perfection doesn't come easily, even for the noble Duke of Ashton. . . Battered by the sea, Adam remembers nothing of his past, his ducal rank, nor of the shipwreck that almost claimed his life. However, he's delighted to hear that the golden-haired vision tending his wounds is his wife. Mariah's name and face may not be familiar, but her touch, her warmth, feel deliciously right. . . When Mariah Clarke prayed for a way to deter a bullying suitor, she didn't imagine she'd find the answer washed ashore on a desolate beach. Convincing Adam that he is her husband is surprisingly easy. Resisting the temptation to act his wife, in every way, will prove anything but. And now a passion begun in fantasy has become dangerously real--and completely irresistible. . .	350	July 1st 2009	Adam Lawford, Duke of Ashton, Mariah Clarke, Agnes Westerfield, James Kirkland, Lord Will Masterson, Julia Bancroft, Alexander Randall	Kent, England, Hartley, England (United Kingdom), Glasgow, Scotland, London, England , 1812 (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6066533-loving-a-lost-lord
