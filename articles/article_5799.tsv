Slapstick, or Lonesome No More!		Kurt Vonnegut Jr.	3.87	35493	1454	Slapstick presents an apocalyptic vision as seen through the eyes of the current King of Manhattan (and last President of the United States), a wickedly irreverent look at the all-too-possible results of today’s follies. But even the end of life-as-we-know-it is transformed by Kurt Vonnegut’s pen into hilarious farce—a final slapstick that may be the Almighty’s joke on us all.	288	1976	Wilbur Daffodil-11 Swain	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9595.Slapstick_or_Lonesome_No_More_
