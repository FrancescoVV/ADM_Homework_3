Brawn	New Species #5	Laurann Dohner	4.21	16483	665	One look at Brawn and Becca is wondering how he’d look without his clothes. Brawn is instantly attracted to Becca but has sworn never to touch a human female. They just aren’t sturdy enough and he likes his sex a little rough. He is shocked to learn he’ll be living with her when she refuses to leave her home. He is there to represent New Species and to learn about humans so maybe this will be a good educational experience. He just has to keep his hands off her. His good intentions go astray when they are kidnapped and locked together inside a cage. Brawn finds himself reliving a nightmare when he is once again subjected to breeding experiments at the hands of New Species’ enemies. They will use Becca to get what they want from him. Brawn will do everything he can to protect her but they only have each other to depend on while trying to survive.	211	January 1st 2011	Tiger, Breeze, Flame, Brawn, Slade, Vengeance, Obsidian (#880), Brass, Becca Oberto, Wrath (New Species)	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13107655-brawn
