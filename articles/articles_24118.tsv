No Longer Safe		A.J. Waines	3.71	3229	288	She was your best friend. Now she’s your deadliest enemy – and there’s nowhere to run… When Alice receives an invitation from Karen, her charismatic University friend, to stay in a remote cottage in Scotland, she can’t wait to rekindle their lost friendship. But two more former students arrive – never friends of Alice’s – and as the atmosphere chills, Karen isn’t the warm-hearted soulmate Alice remembers. Barely is the reunion underway before someone is dead and the fragile gathering is pushed to breaking point. As the snow cuts them off from civilisation and accusations fly, Alice finds herself a pawn, sinking deeper into a deadly game she can’t escape. NO LONGER SAFE is a chilling Psychological Thriller that delivers a delicious sting in the tail.	377	February 4th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28090093-no-longer-safe
