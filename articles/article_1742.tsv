Immortality		Milan Kundera, Peter Kussi	4.14	30571	1745	This breathtaking, reverberating survey of human nature finds Kundera still attempting to work out the meaning of life, without losing his acute sense of humour. It is one of those great unclassifiable masterpieces that appear once every twenty years or so. 'It will make you cleverer, maybe even a better lover. Not many novels can do that.' Nicholas Lezard, GQ	400	January 12th 1990	Agnes, Beatrice (diverse works), Rainer Maria Rilke, Laura Spencer, Goethe, Bettina, Bernard Bertrand, Bertrand Bertrand, Christine	Paris (France), Rome (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28634.Immortality
