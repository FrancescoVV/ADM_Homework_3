The Mysterious Case of the Allbright Academy	The Mysterious Matter of I. M Fine #2	Diane Stanley	4.03	504	71	Franny is thrilled when she's accepted by the Allbright Academy, an elite private boarding school designed to train leaders. But she knows she's not as smart as the other kids there—or as beautiful, accomplished, confident, or mature. The fact is, the Allbright students—from their shining teeth and flawless complexions to their sky-high test scores and long lists of honors—are absolutely perfect. Then the Allbright magic begins to rub off on Franny, too. The question is: Is this a good thing? Can Franny and her friends Cal, Brooklyn, and Prescott un-ravel the Allbright Academy's secret, or will they, too, succumb to its eerie perfection?	272	January 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2689001-the-mysterious-case-of-the-allbright-academy
