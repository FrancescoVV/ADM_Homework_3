A Court of Frost and Starlight	A Court of Thorns and Roses #3.1	Sarah J. Maas	3.88	142731	15430	Hope warms the coldest night. Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve. Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.	229	May 1st 2018	Feyre Archeron, Rhysand		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31076583-a-court-of-frost-and-starlight
