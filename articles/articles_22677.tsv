Jacinto's Remnant	Gears of War #2	Karen Traviss	4.15	2129	79	Based on the blockbuster Xbox game, this is the stunning story of the men and women who stood between a planet and total destruction–and now have to face the consequences of their actions. After a brutal fifteen-year war for survival, the Coalition of Ordered Governments is forced to destroy mankind’s last city in a final bid to stop the Locust Horde. As the survivors flee Jacinto, they must contend with the last of the Locust, bent on vengeance, as they struggle to stay alive in an icy wilderness. Marcus Fenix, Dom Santiago, and their fellow Gears fight to get Jacinto’s refugees to a safe haven, but find themselves in a lawless new world where the enemy is human–and as desperate and dangerous as any grub.	400	January 1st 2009	Marcus Fenix, Dominic Santiago, Augustus Cole, Damon Baird, Anya Stroud, Victor Hoffmann, Bernadette "Bernie" Mataki, Adam Fenix, Maria Santiago, Tai Kaliso, Padrick Salton, Queen Myrrah, Quentin Michaelson, Richard Prescott		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6276888-jacinto-s-remnant
