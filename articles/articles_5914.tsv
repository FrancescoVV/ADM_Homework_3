Dragon Spear	Dragon Slippers #3	Jessica Day George	4.19	14144	730	For Creel, all is right with the world. The dragon king, Shardas, and his queen, Velika, have made a comfy home on the Far Isles, and humans and dragons seem to be at peace. It's the perfect time for Creel to plan her wedding to Prince Luka. Well, it was perfect -- until Velika gets kidnapped, and Creel and Luka set off to save her. And if their most dangerous adventure yet wasn't enough to throw off the wedding, a bridal-gown fiasco just might do the trick. Creel wouldn't trade her friendship with the dragons for the world, but doesn't every girl deserve her happily ever after?	248	May 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5933646-dragon-spear
