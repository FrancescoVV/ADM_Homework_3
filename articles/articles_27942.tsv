Fallen Fourth Down	Fallen Crest High #4	Tijan	4.36	18551	1054	My mother tried to destroy me. She doesn’t exist to me anymore and my father, the one who raised me and the biological one, are both works in progress. The only two people that I can trust are Mason and Logan, and they’re the two people who I could lose. It won’t happen. I won’t let it. No matter the truth, no matter who loves me, I won’t let anything or anyone come between us. They’re my world. They’re my life. They’re my family.	402	September 29th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20351509-fallen-fourth-down
