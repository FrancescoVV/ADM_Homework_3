The Smiling Country	Hewey Calloway #2	Elmer Kelton	4.27	294	30	Hewey is back; older, wiser, and badly banged up trying to break a renegade bronc. His wandering days are over because of his injuries, because of fences that cut up the range, because of trucks and automobiles. But how will Hewey handle the new circumstances of his life? And how will Spring react to his return?	257	August 1st 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/897264.The_Smiling_Country
