The Lovely Bones		Alice Sebold	3.82	2021150	40578	"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973." So begins the story of Susie Salmon, who is adjusting to her new home in heaven, a place that is not at all what she expected, even as she is watching life on earth continue without her -- her friends trading rumors about her disappearance, her killer trying to cover his tracks, her grief-stricken family unraveling. Out of unspeakable tragedy and loss, The Lovely Bones succeeds, miraculously, in building a tale filled with hope, humor, suspense, even joy.	372	July 3rd 2002	Susie Salmon, Clarissa, Holly, Jack Salmon, Abigail Salmon, Lindsey Salmon, Buckley Salmon, George Harvey	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States), Pennsylvania (United States), United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12232938-the-lovely-bones
