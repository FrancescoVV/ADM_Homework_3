Greegs & Ladders		Zack Mitchell, Danny Mendlow	3.06	263	12	Greegs & Ladders is a wildly exciting tale of three oddball characters romping around space and time. Equal parts social satire and fun loving adventure, Greegs promises laughs, a few mildly intelligent and/or interesting observations, & several run-on sentences. You'll also get to find out what the hell Greegs are, and how life on Earth came to be, and the meaning of it all (at no extra charge.)	256	June 22nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197756-greegs-ladders
