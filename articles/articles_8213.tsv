The Reapers are the Angels	Reapers #1	Alden Bell	3.89	11091	1613	Zombies have infested a fallen America. A young girl named Temple is on the run. Haunted by her past and pursued by a killer, Temple is surrounded by death and danger, hoping to be set free. For twenty-five years, civilization has survived in meager enclaves, guarded against a plague of the dead. Temple wanders this blighted landscape, keeping to herself - and keeping her demons inside. She can't remember a time before the zombies, but she does remember an old man who took her in and the younger brother she cared for until the tragedy that set her on a personal journey toward redemption. Moving back and forth between the insulated remnants of society and the brutal frontier beyond, Temple must decide where ultimately to make a home and find the salvation she seeks.	225	August 3rd 2010	Temple, Mo√Øse Todd, Maury	South (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8051458-the-reapers-are-the-angels
