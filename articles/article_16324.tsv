A Heart Like Jesus		Max Lucado	4.36	214	16	The heart of Jesus is sacred, and the lessons and examples it provides to us are paramount in our daily mission to follow in His footsteps. Max Lucado poses the question "what if, for one day and night, your heart was replaced by the heart of Christ?" That thought-provoking question leads to many personal revelations demonstrating that we can recast our hearts to be more like that of Jesus, and the blessings created by the transformation will unleash ripples to the widest edges of our lives and those around us.	96	February 9th 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/281493.A_Heart_Like_Jesus
