Outcast	Warriors: Power of Three #3	Erin Hunter	4.27	17234	415	There will be three, Kin of your kin.... Who hold the Power of the stars In their paws. A secret prophecy shapes the lives of Firestar's grandchildren, but only one of the three knows about it. Jaypaw is captivated by the power it promises, and he believes the key to that power may lie buried in the distant past -- with the ancient cats who once walked these woods and now prowl through his dreams. His search for answers leads him toward the mountains -- the home of the Tribe of Rushing Water. Lionpaw and Hollypaw feel drawn to the mountains too, for different reasons. But the mountains hide secrets as well as answers, and if the three cats find a way to get there, they may discover more than they ever expected.	352	April 22nd 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2237117.Outcast
