Becoming Human		Jean Vanier	4.24	1299	141	In this deeply compassionate work, Jean Vanier shares his profoundly human vision for creating a common good that radically changes our communities, our relationships, and ourselves. He proposes that by opening ourselves to others, those we perceive as weak, different, or inferior, we can achieve true personal and societal freedom.	166	November 1st 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348823.Becoming_Human
