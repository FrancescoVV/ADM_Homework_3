Catch of the Day	Gideon's Cove #1	Kristan Higgins	3.91	12269	1056	First date à la Maggie: Take one lovelorn diner owner (me), a generous helping of nosy local gossips, a dollop of envy at married sister's perfect life, a splash of divine intervention (my matchmaking priest). Combine ingredients with one adorable puppy, add a strong but silent lobsterman with a hidden heart of gold and watch the sparks fly.	384	September 25th 2007	Maggie Beaumont, Malone, Tim O’Halloran	Gideon’s Cove, Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/950018.Catch_of_the_Day
