Cujo		Stephen King	3.73	229706	4909	Outside a peaceful town in central Maine, a monster is waiting. Cujo is a two-hundred-pound Saint Bernard, the best friend Brett Camber has ever had. One day Cujo chases a rabbit into a bolt-holeâ€”a cave inhabited by sick bats. What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inexorably drawing in all the people around him makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has written.	432	September 8th 1981	Tad Trenton, Donna Trenton, Vic Trenton, Steve Kemp, Joe Camber, Charity Camber, Brett Camber, Cujo, Roger Breakstone, Gary Pervier, Frank Dodd	Castle Rock, Maine (United States), Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Stratford, Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10603.Cujo
