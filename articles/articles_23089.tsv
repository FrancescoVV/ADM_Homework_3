My Midnight Moonlight Valentine	Vampire’s Romance #1	J.J. McAvoy	4.36	290	77	Druella Monroe is a vampire, but she hasn’t been one for long. Ever since her rebirth a year ago, she’s done her best to live a quiet, peaceful life as an art conservator and restorationist at The National Gallery of Art. All she wants is to blend in with the humans. However that all gets thrown out the window one night while hunting in Great Falls Park, where Druella comes across a naked vampire with no memory of how he got there, or the last century for that matter. All he seems to be sure of is that she is his soulmate…and he won’t leave without her.		May 1st 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53241347-my-midnight-moonlight-valentine
