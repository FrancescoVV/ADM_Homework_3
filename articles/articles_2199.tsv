His Majesty's Dragon	Temeraire #1	Naomi Novik	4.04	80368	6462	Aerial combat brings a thrilling new dimension to the Napoleonic Wars as valiant warriors ride mighty fighting dragons, bred for size or speed. When HMS Reliant captures a French frigate and seizes the precious cargo, an unhatched dragon egg, fate sweeps Captain Will Laurence from his seafaring life into an uncertain future – and an unexpected kinship with a most extraordinary creature. Thrust into the rarified world of the Aerial Corps as master of the dragon Temeraire, he will face a crash course in the daring tactics of airborne battle. For as France’s own dragon-borne forces rally to breach British soil in Bonaparte’s boldest gambit, Laurence and Temeraire must soar into their own baptism of fire.	356	January 3rd 2006	Temeraire, Captain Will Laurence, John Granby, Emily Roland	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28876.His_Majesty_s_Dragon
