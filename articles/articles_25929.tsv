Babygirl	Black Butterfly #1	Lorna Jackie Wilson	3.96	23	12	In 1977, siblings Tina, Michelle, and Leon Hilton live with their mother, Catherine, in Detroit. Although times are tough, Catherine does the best she can with the support of her mother-and in spite of the abuse she receives from her boyfriend, Victor. When eleven-year-old Michelle is accidentally injured, a caseworker from Child Protective Services (CPS) visits the family. Later, Victor's drug stash is found in their house, and soon the three siblings are taken from their mother and placed into separate foster homes. Over the next several months, Michelle experiences a number of foster homes that lead her to question and challenge the lifestyle and sense of identity that she has experienced thus far, significantly affecting her self-esteem, purpose, and well-being. Meanwhile, Catherine works to put her life back together and win back custody of her children. This is the story of a family dealing with physical and emotional abuse, substance addiction, and the foster care system as one girl grows to young adulthood in the face of unusual odds.	280	September 10th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50633455-babygirl
