My Name Is Red		Orhan Pamuk, Erdağ M. Göknar	3.85	45163	4157	At once a fiendishly devious mystery, a beguiling love story, and a brilliant symposium on the power of art, My Name Is Red is a transporting tale set amid the splendor and religious intrigue of sixteenth-century Istanbul, from one of the most prominent contemporary Turkish writers. The Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Part fantasy and part philosophical puzzle, My Name is Red is a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.	417	1998	Kara, Şeküre, Kelebek, Zeytin, Leylek, Enişte Efendi, Zarif, Şevket, Orhan, Hasan (My Name is Red), Üstat Osman Efendi, Esther (My name is red)	Istanbul (Turkey), Turkey	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2517.My_Name_Is_Red
