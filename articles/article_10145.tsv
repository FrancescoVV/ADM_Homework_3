Kaden		Synne Jakobsen	4.28	76	13	After a century of captivity, Kaden—a ruthless, bloodthirsty wolf with no loyalties—is out for blood. But while on a mission to eliminate one of his enemies, Kaden meets his mate, a she-wolf with problems of her own. He takes her after mercilessly slaughtering her pack. She refuses to accept him because he is a cold-blooded killer with an insatiable hunger for violence. They were destined to be together, but even the moon goddess herself must realize that they are a very bad match.	343	July 30th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26017870-kaden
