But upon awakening to the cruelty and injustice it encompasses, Caroline's eyes are opened for the first time to the men and women who have cared tirelessly for her. Her journey of maturity and faith will draw her into the abolitionist movement, where she is confronted with the risks and sacrifices her beliefs entail.	431	November 1st 2002		Richmond, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192722.Candle_in_the_Darkness
