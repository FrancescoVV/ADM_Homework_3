The Invaders	Brotherband Chronicles #2	John Flanagan	4.40	18949	615	The adventure continues in the Ranger's Apprentice companion trilogy! Hal and the Herons have done the impossible. This group of outsiders has beaten out the strongest, most skilled young warriors in all of Skandia to win the Brotherband competition. But their celebration comes to an abrupt end when the Skandians' most sacred artifact, the Andomal, is stolen--and the Herons are to blame. To find redemption they must track down the thief Zavac and recover the Andomal. But that means traversing stormy seas, surviving a bitter winter, and battling a group of deadly pirates willing to protect their prize at all costs. Even Brotherband training and the help of Skandia's greatest warrior may not be enough to ensure that Hal and his friends return home with the Andomal--or their lives.	429	2012	Stig Olafson, Hal Mikkelson, Edvin, Ingvar, Thorn, Stefan, Jesper, Ulf, Wulf, Zavac, Lydia		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13003565-the-invaders
