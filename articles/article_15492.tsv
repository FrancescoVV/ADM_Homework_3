Atlantis Redeemed	Warriors Of Poseidon #5	Alyssa Day	4.29	4340	130	Poseidon’s warriors have learned that the battle to protect humanity produces unexpected enemies - and alliances. But none more unexpected than the bond between a cursed Atlantean warrior and a woman whose sight surpasses any lie… A warrior with no emotion… Doomed by Poseidon millennia ago to live life bereft of feelings, Atlantean warrior Brennan’s curse is shattered when he meets Tiernan - a human with the ancient Gift of Truth Telling. Attraction turns deadly when the woman he could never forget becomes the woman he can never remember. With the fate of Atlantis on the line, will a warrior’s uncontrollable desire destroy the world? A woman with an eye for the truth… Tiernan’s job as an investigative reporter is perfectly suited to her unique ability to see through any falsehood. But when she discovers human scientists conducting hideous experiments on humans and shape-shifters alike, only a wildly sexy Atlantean can help protect her from the those determined to see her fail and die. When the future of the world is at stake, can she overcome death itself so together they can protect mankind? When truth and passion collide… Atlantis is redeemed.	337	March 2nd 2010	Brennan, Tiernan Butler	Wyoming (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6602818-atlantis-redeemed
