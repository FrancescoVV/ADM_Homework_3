Nausica채 of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 1	Nausica채 of the Valley of the Wind #1	Hayao Miyazaki, David Lewis, Toren Smith, Kaori Inoue, Joe Yamazaki	4.47	9988	389	In a long-ago war, humankind set off a devastating ecological disaster. Thriving industrial societies disappeared. The earth is slowly submerging beneath the expanding Sea of Corruption, an enormous toxic forest that creates mutant insects and releases a miasma of poisonous spores into the air. At the periphery of the sea, tiny kingdoms are scattered on tiny parcels of land. Here lies the Valley of the Wind, a kingdom of barely 500 citizens; a nation given fragile protection from the decaying sea's poisons by the ocean breezes; and home to Nausica채 . Nausica채, a young princess, has an emphatic bond with the giant Ohmu insects and animals of every creed. She fights to create tolerance, understanding and patience among empires that are fighting over the world's remaining precious natural resources.	130	1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/626339.Nausica_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_Vol_1
