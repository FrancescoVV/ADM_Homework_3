Delivering the trademark insight and humor readers the world over have come to expect from “the purely funniest English writer since Wodehouse” ( Washington Post Book World ), Unseen Academicals focuses on the wizards at Ankh-Morpork’s Unseen University, who are reknowned for many things—sagacity, magic, and their love of teatime—as they attempt to conquer athletics.	417	October 6th 2009	Rincewind, Havelock Vetinari, The Librarian, Mustrum Ridcully, Ponder Stibbons, Trevor Likely, Juliet Stollop, Glenda Sugarbean, Mr. Nutt		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6250169-unseen-academicals
