The View on the Way Down		Rebecca Wait	3.91	972	151	An astonishing and powerfully moving debut novel. This novel will open your eyes and break your heart. It is the story of Emma's two brothers – the one who died five years ago and the one who left home on the day of the funeral and has not returned since. It is the story of her parents – who have been keeping the truth from Emma, and each other. It is a story you will want to talk about, and one you will never forget.
