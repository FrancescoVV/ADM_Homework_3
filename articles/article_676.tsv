The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants	Sisterhood #1	Ann Brashares	3.80	625904	7408	Carmen got the jeans at a thrift shop. They didn’t look all that great: they were worn, dirty, and speckled with bleach. On the night before she and her friends part for the summer, Carmen decides to toss them. But Tibby says they’re great. She'd love to have them. Lena and Bridget also think they’re fabulous. Lena decides that they should all try them on. Whoever they fit best will get them. Nobody knows why, but the pants fit everyone perfectly. Even Carmen (who never thinks she looks good in anything) thinks she looks good in the pants. Over a few bags of cheese puffs, they decide to form a sisterhood and take the vow of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . . . the next morning, they say good-bye. And then the journey of the pants — and the most memorable summer of their lives — begins.	294	September 11th 2001	Bridget Vreeland, Tibby Rollins, Carmen Lowell, Lena Kaligaris, Effie Kaligaris, Duncan Howe, Al Lowell, Eric Richman, Kostos Dounas	Santorini (Greece), South Carolina (United States), Bethesda, Maryland (United States), Loreto, Baja California Sur (Mexico)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/452306.The_Sisterhood_of_the_Traveling_Pants
