Good Wives	Little Women #1, part 2	Louisa May Alcott	3.95	25227	1149	NOTE: Little Women is sometimes published in two volumes, entitled Little Women and Good Wives. This is essentially the second part of Little Women. Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her 'charming novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions. Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure "Yes" or "No" with the chill on.	248	1868	Marmee, Meg March, Beth March, Amy March, Jo March		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78960.Good_Wives
