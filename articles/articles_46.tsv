A GAME OF THRONES Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. source: georgerrmartin.com	835	August 6th 1996	Brandon Stark, Catelyn Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Eddard Stark, Theon Greyjoy, Robb Stark, Arya Stark, Jaime Lannister, Joffrey Baratheon, Robert Baratheon, Tywin Lannister, Lysa Arryn, Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark, Viserys Targaryen, Varys, Hodor, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr, Sandor Clegane, Samwell Tarly, Pyp, Tommen Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Grenn, Mace Tyrell, Septa Mordane, Jon Snow, Cersei Lannister, Jorah Mormont	The Lands of Ice and Fire	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones
