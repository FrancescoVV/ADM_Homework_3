Does God Exist?		William Lane Craig	4.23	84	8	In his follow-up to Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?, Dr. Craig takes a departure from special revelation to present the powerful philosophical and scientific evidence for God found in natural theology. Premise-by-premise, point-by-point, Does God Exist? builds the case for God in language our secular culture understands.	68	August 8th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23171293-does-god-exist
