The End of History and the Last Man		Francis Fukuyama	3.56	4978	356	Ever since its first publication in 1992, The End of History and the Last Man has provoked controversy and debate. Francis Fukuyama's prescient analysis of religious fundamentalism, politics, scientific progress, ethical codes, and war is as essential for a world fighting fundamentalist terrorists as it was for the end of the Cold War. Now updated with a new afterword, The End of History and the Last Man is a modern classic.	464	1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57981.The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man
