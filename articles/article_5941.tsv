The Chaos	Num8ers #2	Rachel Ward	3.82	7319	620	Adam sees “numbers” – when he looks in peoples’ eyes he can see their death-dates, just like his mum Jem used to. Adam has trouble dealing with his awful gift, and when he realises that everyone around him has the same series of numbers, he becomes deeply afraid of what might happen in 2025. Desperate to find out what could be about to go wrong, Adam spends hours researching possibilities – war, nuclear accidents, killer viruses. He knows something big is coming, but what? And is there anything he can possibly do about it?	345	June 7th 2010	Sarah Parker, Mia, Adam Wilde	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7248435-the-chaos
