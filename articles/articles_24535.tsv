Revenge of the Flower Girls	Brewster Triplets #1	Jennifer Ziegler	4.23	696	100	One bride. Two boys. Three flowers girls who won't forever hold their peace. What could go wrong with this wedding? Everything! The Brewster triplets — Dawn, Darby, and Delaney — would usually spend their summer eating ice cream, playing with their dog, and reading about the United States presidents. But this year they're stuck helping their big sister, Lily, plan her wedding. Lily use to date Alex, who was fun and nice and played trivia games with the triplets, and no one's quite sure why they broke up. Burton, Lily's groom-to-be, is not nice or fun, and he looks like an armadillo. The triplets can't stand to see Lily marry someone who's completely wrong for her, so it's up to them to stop the wedding before anyone says "I do"! The flower girls will stop at nothing to delay Lily's big day, but will sprinklers, a photo slideshow, a muddy dog, and some unexpected allies be enough to prevent their big sister — and the whole Brewster family — from living un happily ever after? Three times the flower girls means three times the mayhem in this hilarious, sweet story from Jennifer Ziegler.	229	May 27th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693365-revenge-of-the-flower-girls
