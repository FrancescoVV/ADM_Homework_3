Her destiny is to protect humans from the vengence of exiled angels. Knowing who to trust is key but, when Grigori reinforcements arrive, it becomes clear everyone is hiding something. Even Lincoln.

And the ultimate betrayal exposed. Enticed (now retitled ENTICE) is the second compelling book in The Violet Eden Chapters.
