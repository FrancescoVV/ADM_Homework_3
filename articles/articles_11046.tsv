Grey	Covenant of Shadows #1	Kade Cook	4.06	99	31	Enchantments will fail. Closet doors will open. And skeletons—all dressed in their finest secrets—will come out to dance. Raised in urban downtown New York, Gabrian holds no grand illusions of how life really works. And legends of magic and vampires, nothing more than a bunch of hocus pocus stuffed within book pages or painted on the big screen. But when a woman, no one else can see, enters her office and delivers a riddle filled warning about her intended fate, Gabrian's grip on sanity takes a big hit—terrified she is falling into madness. As Gabrian untangles secrets of her past, she discovers a powerful, hidden world of magic in which there is no return. Now, she must choose a side. To walk in the light… or to run within the shadows of darkness.	398	August 15th 2016		Mount Desert Island, Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32284715-grey
