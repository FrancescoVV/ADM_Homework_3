Heir Apparent	Rasmussem Corporation #2	Vivian Vande Velde	4.10	9879	748	In the virtual reality game Heir Apparent, there are way too many ways to get killed--and Giannine seems to be finding them all. Which is a darn shame, because unless she can get the magic ring, locate the stolen treasure, answer the dwarf's dumb riddles, impress the head-chopping statue, charm the army of ghosts, fend off the barbarians, and defeat the man-eating dragon, she'll never win. And she has to, because losing means she'll die-- for real this time.	352	October 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213652.Heir_Apparent
