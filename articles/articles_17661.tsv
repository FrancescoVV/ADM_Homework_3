Man Of Fortune	The Best Men #2	Rochelle Alers	4.35	400	14	Close friends since childhood, Kyle, Duncan and Ivan have become rich, successful co-owners of a beautiful Harlem brownstone. The one thing each of them lacks is a special woman to share his life with--until true love steps in to transform three sexy single guys into grooms-to-be.... Once bitten, twice shy--it's a lesson that Tamara Wolcott took to heart after her first marriage. But the handsome, witty financial whiz she ends up trapped in an elevator with could make her change her mind. Duncan Gilmore doesn't hide his attraction to voluptuous E.R. doctor Tamara, but he has his own reasons for hesitating to commit. Even though each encounter draws them deeper into an intensely passionate affair, Tamara begins to wonder whether her luck--and her lover--are about to run out again. Their future together depends on whether Duncan is willing to take a chance, and truly let her into his life....	304	July 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6100340-man-of-fortune
