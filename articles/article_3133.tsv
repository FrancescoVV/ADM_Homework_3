Skyward	Skyward #1	Brandon Sanderson	4.52	68500	9949	Defeated, crushed, and driven almost to extinction, the remnants of the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot. When she discovers the wreckage of an ancient ship, she realizes this dream might be possibleâ€”assuming she can repair the ship, navigate flight school, and (perhaps most importantly) persuade the strange machine to help her. Because this ship, uniquely, appears to have a soul.	513	November 6th 2018	Spensa Nightshade		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward
