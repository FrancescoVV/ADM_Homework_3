More Than Forever	More Than #4	Jay McLean	4.47	15705	1450	-LUCY- There is a love so fierce it cannot be measured. A heart so strong it will never slow. There is a promise so sure it can never lie. He promised me that love forever. Even when it wasn't enough. -CAMERON- Forever. Everlasting. Eternal. There is no measure of time. No sounds of the ticking of a clock. Just the rising and falling of the sun. And our own sense of forever. But our forever isn't always.	348	July 10th 2014	Lucy Preston		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18628601-more-than-forever
