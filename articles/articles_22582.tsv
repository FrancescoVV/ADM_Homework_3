The Carnivorous Lamb		Agustín Gómez Arcos, William Rodarmor, Jamie O'Neill, Sharon G. Feldman	4.16	722	77	The latest in the Little Sister’s Classics series resurrecting gay and lesbian literary gems: a viciously funny, shocking yet ultimately moving 1975 novel, an allegory of Franco’s Spain, about a young gay man (the self-described “carnivorous lamb”) coming of age with a mother who despises him, a father who ignores him, and a brother who loves him. Author Agustin Gomez-Arcos left his native Spain for France in the 1960s to escape its censorship policies. The Carnivorous Lamb , originally written in French, won the Prix Hermes, and this, its 1984 English translation, was widely acclaimed.	288	1975	Ignacio, Carlos, Antonio, Mathilde, Clara	Spain	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1028853.The_Carnivorous_Lamb
