A Guinea Pig Christmas Carol		Tess Gammell, Alex Goodwin, Charles Dickens	4.29	72	17	The ultimate and timeless Christmas story, with cuddly guinea pigs in the starring roles! Miserable to the core and wholly unwilling to extend a paw to help those in desperate need, the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge says "bah, Humbug!" to the festive season. But one night he is visited by three Christmas Spirits who take him on a journey through time, so he can see the error of his ways and learn the true meaning of Christmas. This is Charles Dickens's joyful Christmas tale, retold in an entirely new way.	64	October 9th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39663233-a-guinea-pig-christmas-carol
