Fire and Ice	Warriors #2	Erin Hunter	4.38	45206	1840	Fireheart could hear a roaring around him, like wind in tall trees. The acrid stench of the Thunderpath stung his nostrils, together with a new smell, sharper and more terrifying. Fire! Book Two of WARRIORS continues Fireheart's quest to be a true warrior, when he finds new danger lurking in the woods as the chill of winter sets in. WindClan is missing, and hostilities between the remaining three clans place all the cats in peril. Illness and tragic accidents weaken the camp, and ThunderClan needs all its warriors to defend itself - but Fireheart suspects that certain cats may not be as loyal as they appear.	317	June 1st 2003	Lionheart, Graystripe, Fireheart, Bluestar, Tigerclaw, Whitestorm, Crookedstar, Ravenpaw, Spottedleaf, Darkstripe, Longtail, Runningwind, Willowpelt, Mousefur, Frostfur, Brindleface, Goldenflower, Speckletail, Halftail, Patchpelt, One-eye, Dappletail, Brokenstar, Runningnose, Dawncloud, Ashfur, Tallstar, Blackfoot, Boulder, Wetfoot, Cinderfur, Littlecloud, Deadfoot, Barkface, Mudclaw, Tornear, Onewhisker, Ashfoot, Morningflower, Leopardfur, Mudfur, Blackclaw, Stonefur, Mistyfoot, Loudbelly, Silverstream, Whiteclaw, Cloudkit, Brackenpaw, Cinderpaw, Dustpaw, Sandpaw	The Forest, Fourtrees	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/275000.Fire_and_Ice
