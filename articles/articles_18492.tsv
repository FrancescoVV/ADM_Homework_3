Kaja Star: No Place Like Home		Aaron Rocheleau	3.86	7	3	On the day Titus Markava plans to propose, he is horrified to discover that the love of his life is actually a shape-shifting alien man. Before he can recover from the unfortunate news, he is quite literally thrown from Earth onto a completely different world in a completely different solar system. It is a world where a person might conduct himself almost as well as he conducts electricity. It is a world on the brink of an interplanetary conflict. It is a world of dinosoids, insectavores, and even a cyborg or two. It is a world with CNN… just not quite the same CNN we’re used to. Yet even though it is a world where entire planets can be traversed instantly by portals called gates, Titus can’t find even one to take him back home.	400	July 15th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28650139-kaja-star
