Second Chance Summer		Morgan Matson	4.15	45354	5640	Sandwiched between two exceptional siblings, Taylor Edwards never felt like she stood out—except for her history of running away when things get too complicated. Then her dad receives unexpected, terrible news, and the family makes the last-minute decision to spend the summer together in the cramped quarters at their old lake house. Taylor hasn't been to the summerhouse since she was twelve, and she definitely never planned on going back. Up at the lake she is confronted with people she thought she had left behind, like her former best friend Lucy, and Henry Crosby, her first crush, who's all grown up...and a lot cuter. Suddenly Taylor is surrounded by memories she'd rather leave in the past—but she can't run away this time. As the days lying on the beach pass into nights gazing at the stars, Taylor realizes she has a second chance—with friends, with family, maybe even with love. But she knows that once the summer ends, there is no way to recapture what she stands to lose. From Morgan Matson, the PW Flying Start author of Amy & Roger’s Epic Detour , this is a remarkable new novel about hope in the face of heartbreaking grief.	468	May 8th 2012	Taylor Edwards, Henry Crosby, Lucy Marino, Warren Edwards, Robin Edwards, Gesley Edwards	Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11071466-second-chance-summer
