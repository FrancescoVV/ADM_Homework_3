Real Vampires Have Curves	Glory St. Clair #1	Gerry Bartlett	3.80	6649	341	What - did you think all vamps were pale, thin and brooding? Don't I wish. Gloriana St. Clair is an eternally "full-figured" vampire-she just happened to be bloating when a sexy Scotsman sank his teeth into her. She and said Scot- Angus Jeremiah Campbell III, aka Jeremy Blade-have been on and off again for centuries, currently off. A couple hundred years has taught them how to press each other's buttons-in good ways and bad. Glory's headed for Austin and a new business venture: Vintage Vamp's Emporium. After all, she loves clothes, and she is an antique. Only problem is, there's a billionaire techno-freak vampire hunter on the loose. Blade's in total he- vampire mode, and wants Glory to move in with him so he can "protect" her. But it's time for this vamp to explore her own powers.	330	March 6th 2007	Glory St. Clair		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263146.Real_Vampires_Have_Curves
