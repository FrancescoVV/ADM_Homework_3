Grease		Ron De Christoforo	4.08	1076	32	AFTER TWENTY YEARS, GREASE IS STILL THE WORD It's the story of Sandy and Danny, dance contests, graduation, drive-ins, and wishing the summer would never end; of fighting and, especially, making up. IT'S THE TIME... IT'S THE PLACE... IT'S THE MOTION It's the story of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, Greased Lightnin', gang rumbles, Thunder Road, Rydell High, and the Class of '59. IT'S E-LEC-TRI-FY-IN' Most of all, it's the story of how great it can be to hang with friends-- and that special feeling to be with someone who's crazy about you.	216	January 1st 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2142060.Grease
