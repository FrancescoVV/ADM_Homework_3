The Act of Creation		Arthur Koestler	4.24	420	33	While the study of psychology has offered little in the way of explaining the creative process, Koestler examines the idea that we are at our most creative when rational thought is suspended--for example, in dreams and trancelike states. All who read The Act of Creation will find it a compelling and illuminating book.	752	1964			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30676.The_Act_of_Creation
