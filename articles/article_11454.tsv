Here, Home, Hope		Kaira Rouda	3.40	1253	188	Kelly Johnson becomes restless in her thirty-ninth year. An appetite for more forces her to take stock of her middling middle-American existence and her neighbors' seemingly perfect lives. Her marriage to a successful attorney has settled into a comfortable routine, and being the mother of two adorable sons has been rewarding. But Kelly's own passions lie wasted. She eyes with envy the lives of her two best friends, Kathryn and Charlotte, both beautiful, successful businesswomen who seem to have it all. Kelly takes charge of her life, devising a midlife makeover plan. From page one, Kelly's witty reflections, self-deprecating humor, and clever tactics in executing that plan--she places Post-it notes all over her house and car--will have readers laughing out loud. The next instant, however, they might rant right along with Kelly as her commitment to a sullen, anorexic teenager left on her doorstep tries her patience or as she deflects the boozy advances of a divorced neighbor. Readers will need to keep the tissue box handy, too, as Kelly repairs the damage she inflicted on a high school friend; realizes how deeply her husband, Patrick, understands and loves her; and ultimately grows into a woman empowered by her own blend of home and career. "Endearingly honest, consistency upbeat" - Jenna Blum "A warm, witty and engaging debut that had me laughing out loud." - Amy Hatvany "This funny, moving novel is a model of inspiration and reinvention for anyone seeking to find what's next in life." - Katrina Kittle "I loved Kaira Rouda's book. I love its irony and its courage and humor. It's the real thing." Jacquelyn Mitchard	310	May 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9068791-here-home-hope
