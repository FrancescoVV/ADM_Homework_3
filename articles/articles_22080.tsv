Murder Your Darlings	Algonquin Round Table #1	J.J. Murphy	3.37	588	145	One morning legendary wit Dorothy Parker discovers someone under Manhattan's famed Algonquin Round Table. A little early for a passed out drunk, isn't it? But he's not dead drunk, just dead. When a charming writer from Mississippi named Billy Faulkner becomes a suspect in the murder, Dorothy decides to dabble in a little detective work, enlisting her literary cohorts. It's up to the Algonquins to outwit the true culprit-preferably before cocktail hour-and before the clever killer turns the tables on them.	318	January 4th 2011	Dorothy Parker, William Faulkner, Robert Benchley	Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8427264-murder-your-darlings
