Betrayed: Alternate Ending		Wodke Hawkinson	3.61	1682	146	Brook, a Denver socialite, is abducted during a botched carjacking, and mistreated in the worst possible ways by her captors. She escapes, wandering injured, half-naked, and hopelessly lost in the Colorado wilderness at the onset of a harsh winter. Brook is nearly frozen and almost at the end of her endurance. Lance, a wild-looking reclusive man who has shunned society, likes his solitary life deep in the wooded mountains. But his world is about to be turned upside down. Advisory: Contains sexual violence and strong language.	86	August 11th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13572064-betrayed
