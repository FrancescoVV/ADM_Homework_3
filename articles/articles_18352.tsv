Painted Cities		Alexai Galaviz-Budziszewski	3.83	156	22	To those outside it, Pilsen is a vast barrio on the south side of Chicago. To Alexai Galaviz-Budziszewski, it is a world of violence and decay and beauty, of nuance and pure chance. It is a place where the smell of cooking frijoles is washed away by that of dead fish in the river, where vendettas are a daily routine, and where a fourteen-year-old immigrant might hold the ability bring people back from the dead. Simultaneously tough and tender, these stories mark the debut of a writer poised to represent his city's literature for decades to come.	180	January 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114509-painted-cities
