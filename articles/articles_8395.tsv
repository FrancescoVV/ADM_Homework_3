Wizard at Large	Magic Kingdom of Landover #3	Terry Brooks	3.84	15546	201	It all began when the half-able wizard Questor Thews announced that finally he could restore the Court Scribe Abernathy to human form. All went well until the wizard breahed the magic dust of his spell and suddenly sneezed. Then, where Abernathy had stood, there was only a bottle containing a particularly evil imp, who soon escapes.	303	August 12th 1987			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15561.Wizard_at_Large
