Soulless: The Manga, Vol. 1	The Parasol Protectorate Manga #1	Gail Carriger, Rem, JuYoun Lee	4.13	6289	613	The life of a spinster in Victorian London isn't an easy one on the best of days, but such a life becomes infinitely more complicated when said spinster is "soulless" - a preternatural bridging the gap between the natural and supernatural worlds. Miss Alexia Tarabotti has this unique distinction, and when she is assailed at a formal gathering by a rove vampire, an encounter that results in the death of the half-starved creature, her circumstances become exponentially more complicated indeed! Now caught up in an intrigue with life or death stakes, Alexia must rely on all her talents to outmatch the forces conspiring against her, but it may be the man who has caught her eye - Lord Conall Maccon - and their budding flirtation that truly drives her to her wit's end!	228	March 1st 2012	Alexia Tarabotti, Lord Akeldama, Ivy Hisselpenny, Lord Maccon	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12033364-soulless
