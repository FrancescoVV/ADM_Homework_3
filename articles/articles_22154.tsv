I Remember	Remembrance #1	Cynthia P. O'Neill	4.06	47	11	Jordan Carlisle is a young, career driven woman with a passion for life and family. Her world is suddenly altered by both death and love when she is torn between family loyalty and a chance at happiness with the man who holds her in her dreams. Will time and technology bring her and the handsome stranger together or will the powerful forces that have plagued her since childhood keep them apart? Gregory Riley has kept a secret most of his life to avoid discovery. Now he is on a quest to find the person who can change his life, forever. He knows her face, her touch and her voice; but nothing more. He uses clues, from his dreams, to find both her and a timeless love that defies explanation. In spite of the darkness working to keep them apart, can he get to her first and help her “remember”? Jordan and Gregory discover a deep connection in the ability to encroach on one another’s dreams of both past and present. Together, they learn that their lives have crossed time and time again, only to end tragically. Guided by an unearthly visionary and help from those who have gone before, they are given clues and revelations to uncover their place in history. In order to stay together, they must discover where fate went astray, who is responsible and where they fit in to the ancient prophesy. Working side-by-side, they seek to unlock the hidden powers and mysteries that will defeat the darkness in this life and allow them to be together, forever. Will love finally prevail or will the darkness win again?	446	July 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17909684-i-remember
