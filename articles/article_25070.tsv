Poor Little Bitch Girl	Lucky Santangelo #7	Jackie Collins	3.84	7348	560	Three twenty-something women, one hot rich guy, two mega movie stars, and a devastating murder. Poor Little Bitch Girl has it all. Denver Jones is a hotshot twenty-something attorney working in L.A. Carolyn Henderson is a personal assistant to a powerful and very married senator in Washington with whom she is having an affair. And Annabelle Maestro—the daughter of two movie stars—has carved out a career for herself in New York as the madam of choice for discerning famous men. The three of them went to high school together in Beverly Hills, and although Denver and Carolyn have kept in touch, Annabelle is out on her own with her cocaine-addicted boyfriend, Frankie. Then there is Bobby Santangelo Stanislopolous, the Kennedy-esque son of Lucky Santangelo and deceased Greek shipping billionaire Dimitri Stanislopolous. Bobby owns Mood, the hottest club in New York. Back in the day, he went to high school with Denver, Carolyn, and Annabelle. And he connected with all three of them. Plus, Frankie is his best friend. When Annabelle’s beautiful movie-star mother is found shot to death in the bedroom of her Beverly Hills mansion, the five of them find themselves thrown together…and secrets from the past have a way of coming back to haunt everyone. Poor Little Bitch Girl is a new, sexy, and explosive novel from perennial best-seller Jackie Collins.	472	February 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6791610-poor-little-bitch-girl
