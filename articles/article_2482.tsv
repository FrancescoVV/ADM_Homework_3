Bloody Bones	Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #5	Laurell K. Hamilton	4.11	69409	1312	In Laurell K. Hamilton's "New York Times" bestselling novels, Anita Blake, vampire hunter and animator, takes a bite out of crime-of the supernatural kind. But even someone who deals with death on a daily basis can be unnerved by its power... When Branson, Missouri, is hit with a death wave-four unsolved murders-it doesn't take an expert to realize that all is not well. But luckily for the locals, Anita is an expert-in just the kinds of preternatural goings-on that have everyone spooked. And she's got an "in" with just the kind of creature who can make sense of the slayings: a sexy master vampire known as Jean Claude.	336	October 1st 1996	Anita Blake, Dolph Storr, Jean-Claude (Anita Blake series), Richard Zeeman, Jason Schuyler, Larry Kirkland, Bradley Bradford	Missouri (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30241.Bloody_Bones
