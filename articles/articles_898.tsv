The Drawing of the Three	The Dark Tower #2	Stephen King	4.21	218763	7842	While pursuing his quest for the Dark Tower through a world that is a nightmarishly distorted mirror image of our own, Roland, the last gunslinger, encounters three mysterious doorways on the beach. Each one enters into the life of a different person living in contemporary New York. Here he links forces with the defiant young Eddie Dean and the beautiful, brilliant, and brave Odetta Holmes, in a savage struggle against underworld evil and otherworldly enemies. Once again, Stephen King has masterfully interwoven dark, evocative fantasy and icy realism.	463	May 1987	Eddie Dean, Odetta Holmes, Jack Mort, Roland Deschain, Detta Walker		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5094.The_Drawing_of_the_Three
