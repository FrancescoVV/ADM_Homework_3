A Murder of Quality	George Smiley #2	John le Carré	3.62	12732	906	John le Carré's classic novels deftly navigate readers through the intricate shadow worlds of international espionage with unsurpassed skill and knowledge, and have earned him -- and his hero, British secret Service Agent George Smiley -- unprecedented worldwide acclaim. George Smiley was simply doing a favor for Miss Ailsa Brimley, and old friend and editor of a small newspaper. Miss Brimley had received a letter from a worried reader: "I'm not mad. And I know my husbad is trying to kill me." But the letter had arrived too late: its scribe, the wife of an assistant master at the distinguished Carne School, was already dead. So George Smiley went to Carne to listen, ask questions, and think. And to uncover, layer by layer, the complex network of skeletons and hatreds that comprised that little English institution.	160	1962	George Smiley, Stella Rode, Stanley Rode, Jane Lyn, Terence Fielding, Charles Hecht, Shane Hecht, Ailsa Brimley, Inspector Rigby, Felix D'Arcy, Samuel Glaston, Dorothy D'Arcy, Mr. Cardew, Tim Perkins	Carne, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/622855.A_Murder_of_Quality
