Seven Daughters and Seven Sons		Barbara Cohen, Bahija Fattuhi Lovejoy	4.23	4767	474	In an ancient Arab nation, one woman dares to be different. Buran cannot—Buran will not—sit quietly at home and wait to be married to the man her father chooses. Determined to use her skills and earn a fortune, she instead disguises herself as a boy and travels by camel caravan to a distant city. There, she maintains her masculine disguise and establishes a successful business. The city's crown prince comes often to her shop, and soon Buran finds herself falling in love. But if she reveals to Mahmud that she is a woman, she will lose everything she has worked for.	224	September 28th 1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181440.Seven_Daughters_and_Seven_Sons
