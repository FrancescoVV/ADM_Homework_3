But when he attempts to leave the next morning, he quickly discovers that the locals have other plans. Held captive with seemingly no chance of escape, he is tasked with shoveling back the ever-advancing sand dunes that threaten to destroy the village. His only companion is an odd young woman, and together their fates become intertwined as they work side by side through this Sisyphean of tasks.	241	1962	Niki Jumpei	Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9998.The_Woman_in_the_Dunes
