Blue Lily, Lily Blue	The Raven Cycle #3	Maggie Stiefvater	4.27	120066	13092	The third installment in the all-new series from the #1 NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author Maggie Stiefvater! Blue Sargent has found things. For the first time in her life, she has friends she can trust, a group to which she can belong. The Raven Boys have taken her in as one of their own. Their problems have become hers, and her problems have become theirs. The trick with found things, though, is how easily they can be lost. Friends can betray. Mothers can disappear. Visions can mislead. Certainties can unravel.	391	October 21st 2014	Blue Sargent, Richard "Dick" Campbell Gansey III, Adam Parrish, Ronan Lynch, Noah (The Raven Cycle)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17378508-blue-lily-lily-blue
