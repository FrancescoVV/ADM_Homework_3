Caesar	Masters of Rome #5	Colleen McCullough	4.37	6893	179	It's 54 BCE. Gaius Julius Caesar is sweeping thru Gaul, crushing the fierce, long-haired warrior-kings who stand in his way. His victories in the name of Rome are epic, but the leaders of the Republic are not pleased. They're terrified. Where will the boundless ambition of Rome's most brilliant soldier stop? He must be destroyed before he can overthrow the government & install himself as Dictator.	928	1997	Gaius Cassius Longinus, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Brutus, Marcus Antonius, Julius Caesar, Marcus Tullius Cicero		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3416.Caesar
