Rendezvous with Hymera		Melinda De Ross	4.28	25	19	This book is not currently available for purchase. "Rendezvous with Hymera follows the development of a beautiful love story and a bizarre chain of events which lead to the investigation of a mystery that falls into a strange and somewhat paranormal discipline - Yoga. The amateurish investigation starts when Clara DeVine changes her plans for a vacation and ends up in a strange place, where strange things happen. In the scene enters Colin Lambert, a special man from Clara’s past. Their attempts to elucidate the intriguing mystery bring them close again and the unfinished business between them turns into a beautiful and hot love story. The fate of the female enigma of this story seems to resemble, in a strange way, that of the people lost during The Philadelphia Experiment.".	94	June 20th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25914723-rendezvous
