Northanger Abbey		Jane Austen, Alfred J. Mac Adam	3.83	299326	12348	Jane Austen's first novel—published posthumously in 1818—tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen's fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical novel pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.	251	December 1st 1817	Catherine Morland, Henry Tilney, Eleanor Tilney, General Tilney, John Thorpe, Isabella Thorpe, James Morland, Mrs. Morland, Mr. Morland, Mrs. Allen, Mr. Allen, Captain Tilney, Mrs. Thorpe	Bath, Somerset, England (United Kingdom), Devon, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey
