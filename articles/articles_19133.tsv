When We Began	Timber Creek #3	Elena Aitken	4.49	87	35	A secret threatens to consume her… A man who challenges everything… A connection so strong nothing will ever be the same. Amber has always been in control. Of her high-powered career, her social life (or lack thereof), and well…pretty much everything. At least that’s what everyone thinks. So, when she finds herself back in her hometown, she’ll do anything to keep up the pretense. Including lying to her best friends. ‘Little’ Logan Myers has grown up since high school. In all the right ways. And the first time Amber runs into him in town, sparks fly—but not in a good way. She’s opinionated, controlling and overbearing. But there’s something else—a vulnerability Logan’s pretty sure no one else has seen. Amber has secrets, and a deep hurt that he’s sure he can help her get past. If only she’ll open up. After a lifetime of maintaining tight control an unexpected and overwhelming connection to Logan threatens to turn Amber’s life upside down. She can’t let herself get too close or trust too much, because if she does, the secrets she’s been keeping could ruin everything.	271	October 15th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42195458-when-we-began
