Midwinterblood		Marcus Sedgwick	3.70	10648	2134	Have you ever had the feeling that you've lived another life? Been somewhere that has felt totally familiar, even though you've never been there before, or felt that you know someone well, even though you are meeting them for the first time? It happens. In a novel comprising seven parts, each influenced by a moon - the flower moon, the harvest moon, the hunter's moon, the blood moon - this is the story of Eric and Merle whose souls have been searching for each other since their untimely parting.	264	October 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836471-midwinterblood
