The Golden Bough		James George Frazer	4.03	7805	326	A world classic. "The Golden Bough" describes our ancestors' primitive methods of worship, sex practices, strange rituals and festivals. Disproving the popular thought that primitive life was simple, this monumental survey shows that savage man was enmeshed in a tangle of magic, taboos, and superstitions. Revealed here is the evolution of man from savagery to civilization, from the modification of his weird and often bloodthirsty customs to the entry of lasting moral, ethical, and spiritual values.	880	1890		Persia, Egypt, India, Arabia Asia Major Siam, Arabia, Asia Major, Siam	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/408862.The_Golden_Bough
