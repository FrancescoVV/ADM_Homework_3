Dream Caster	Dream Cycle #1	Najeev Raj Nadarajah	4.14	191	80	Weaver, a young man who longs for a different life, is forced to flee his refugee settlement when everyone in it is massacred. In his flight for safety, Weaver stumbles upon a refuge of survivors hidden among the remains of a ruined city once known as Toronto. In the midst of building a new life, Weaver discovers he can do something strange: cast dreams into reality. Convinced it’s just an anomaly, he ignores it. That is until he learns of the mysterious man who waged war against his world — a man who calls himself the Dream Eater and harnesses the ability to animate nightmares into existence. The peaceful life Weaver hoped for begins to unravel when those of his new home are besieged by the Dream Eater and their lives placed in jeopardy. Weaver must learn to master his accursed ability before his new home is eradicated by the Dream Eater and human existence is pushed to the brink of extinction.	362	September 3rd 2012		The Shield	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16077824-dream-caster
