Vivienne: The Lost and Found (Part 1)		S.M. Bowles	3.89	9	6	Mistreated by her brothers, neglected by her mother and father, Vivienne is born in a time when a woman’s life is not her own. She never really knows true happiness until she meets Gabriel whose love and convictions encourage her to follow her heart and flout the will of her family. But just when she finds the courage to challenge her family’s dictates her father brings home some peculiar guests who cause her to second guess her future. Vivienne is an epic two-part historical fiction/romance novel with a bit of a supernatural twist. Part one takes place in the late 1800's France and part two in the early 1900's America. It is the story of a first love that spans three lifetimes of heartache and tragedy before finally coming to its fateful conclusion.	178	June 20th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738649-vivienne
