Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture		David Kushner	4.28	13695	1051	Masters of Doom is the amazing true story of the Lennon and McCartney of video games: John Carmack and John Romero. Together, they ruled big business. They transformed popular culture. And they provoked a national controversy. More than anything, they lived a unique and rollicking American Dream, escaping the broken homes of their youth to produce the most notoriously successful game franchises in history— Doom and Quake — until the games they made tore them apart. This is a story of friendship and betrayal, commerce and artistry—a powerful and compassionate account of what it's like to be young, driven, and wildly creative.	339	2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom
