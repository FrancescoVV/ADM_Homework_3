Devilish		Michaela Adams	3.76	59	11	His body carries the heat of hell and he has the charms of the devil. I met Liam after my brutal murder. He promised me the impossible chance at life again to find the killers who had wiped out my family so mercilessly. He promised me revenge. Cold, cruel, satisfying revenge. The payment: my soul. My soul would be forever gone, eaten, damned. I would never see my loved ones in the after life again. But I would have Liam, my dark angel. My fallen one. My guardian. And I would have revenge. How could I not accept? **Caution: this book is a dark romance containing explicit violence and highly sexual content.	255	September 10th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26365013-devilish
