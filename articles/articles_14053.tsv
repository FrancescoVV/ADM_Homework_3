El Dorado: Further Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel	The Scarlet Pimpernel (chronological order) #7	Emmuska Orczy	4.12	1486	134	The elusive Pimpernel returns for another swashbuckling adventure in El Dorado. The still-raging French Revolution continues to claim lives, and the shadow of the guillotine draws ever nearer to the young Dauphin, son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. No one dares to attempt to liberate the little prince â€” no one, that is, but the mysterious Sir Percy Blakeney, also known as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Sir Percy takes on one of Robespierre's agents, the scheming Citizen Chauvelin, in a suspenseful blend of action and political intrigue, recounted with captivating period detail. Unabridged republication of the classic 1913 edition.	352	1913			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31503.El_Dorado
