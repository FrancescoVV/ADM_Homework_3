It's good to have a friendly face, you see. At the end. But the end of all things is coming. Charlie's boss and his three associates are riding out, and it's Charlie's job to go before. Sometimes he is sent as a courtesy, sometimes as a warning. He never knows which.	432	April 4th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31408829-the-end-of-the-day
