The Dodgeball Chronicles	Knights of the Lunch Table #1	Frank Cammuso	4.09	5526	200	In this funny new series from Eisner Award nominee Frank Cammuso, the Arthurian legend is reborn--in a funny, average-joe, middle-school boy and his pals. Artie King just wants to ease into life at Camelot Middle School. He's got new lunch buddies, Percy and Wayne, and his science teacher, Mr. Merlyn, is pretty cool. But then there's scary Principal Dagger and big bad Joe and The Horde, a bunch of brawny bullies who rule the school.	144	July 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2887157-the-dodgeball-chronicles
