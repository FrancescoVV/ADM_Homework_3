The World of Suzie Wong		Richard   Mason	3.89	960	95	The timeless story of the love affair between a British artist and a Chinese prostitute. Robert is the only resident of the Nam Kok hotel not renting his room by the hour when he meets Suzie at the bar. She becomes his muse and they fall in love. But even in Hong Kong, where many white expatriates have Chinese mistresses, their romance could jeopardize the things they each hold dear. Set in the mid-1950s, The World of Suzie Wong is a beautifully written time capsule of a novel. First published more than fifty years ago, it resonated with readers worldwide, inspiring a film starring William H olden, a ballet, and even a reggae song. Now readers can experience the romance of this groundbreaking story anew.	352	1957	Suzie Wong, Robert Lomax		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/701773.The_World_of_Suzie_Wong
