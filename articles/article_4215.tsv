The Day of the Locust		Nathanael West, Alfred Kazin	3.75	19731	813	The Day of the Locust is a novel about Hollywood and its corrupting touch, about the American dream turned into a sun-drenched California nightmare. Nathanael West's Hollywood is not the glamorous "home of the stars" but a seedy world of little people, some hopeful, some despairing, all twisted by their by their own desires -- from the ironically romantic artist narrator, to a macho movie cowboy, a middle-aged innocent from America's heartland, and the hard-as-nails call girl would-be-star whom they all lust after. An unforgettable portrayal of a world that mocks the real and rewards the sham, turns its back on love to plunge into empty sex, and breeds a savage violence that is its own undoing, this novel stands as a classic indictment of all that is most extravagant and uncontrolled in American life.	208	1939	Tod Hackett, Faye Greener, Homer Simpson, Abe Kusich	United States of America, Los Angeles, California (United States), Hollywood, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113441.The_Day_of_the_Locust
