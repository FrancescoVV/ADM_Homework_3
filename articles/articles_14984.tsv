Peaches for Father Francis	Chocolat #3	Joanne Harris	3.99	10932	1326	The tantalizing sequel to the blockbuster New York Times bestseller Chocolat Even before it was adapted into the Oscar-nominated film starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp, Joanne Harris’s Chocolat entranced readers with its mix of hedonism, whimsy, and, of course, chocolate. Now, at last, Chocolat ’s heroine returns to the beautiful French village of Lansquenet in another, equally beguiling tale. When Vianne Rocher receives a letter from beyond the grave, she has no choice but to return to Lansquenet, where she once owned a chocolate shop and learned the meaning of home. But returning to one’s past can be a dangerous pursuit, and Vianne and her daughters find the beautiful French village changed in unexpected ways: women veiled in black, the scent of spices in the air, and—facing the church—a minaret. Most surprising of all, her old nemesis, Francis Reynaud, desperately needs her help. Can Vianne work her magic once again?	453	September 13th 2012	Anouk Rocher, Vianne Rocher, Rosette, Roux	Lansquenet-sous-Tannes (France), France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588138-peaches-for-father-francis
