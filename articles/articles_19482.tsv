Forget Me Not		Ellie Terry	4.26	4189	888	A girl with Tourette syndrome starts at a new school and tries to hide her quirks in this debut middle-grade novel in verse. Astronomy-loving Calliope June has Tourette syndrome, so she sometimes makes faces or noises that she doesn't mean to make. When she and her mother move yet again, she tries to hide her TS. But it isn't long before the kids at her new school realize she's different. Only Calli's neighbor, who is also the popular student body president, sees her as she truly isâ€”an interesting person and a good friend. But is he brave enough to take their friendship public? As Calli navigates school, she must also face her mother's new relationship and the fact that she might be moving, again, just as she starts to make friends and finally accept her differences.	336	March 14th 2017		St. George, Utah (United States), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29102841-forget-me-not
