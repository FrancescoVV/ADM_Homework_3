The Education of Patience Goodspeed	Patience Goodspeed  #2	Heather Vogel Frederick	3.84	158	18	In the year since the Morning Star sailed away from Nantucket, Patience Goodspeed has navigated a ship and outwitted mutineers, but this time she faces her biggest challenge yet: boarding school! Now, instead of mathematics and navigation, Patience is forced to study sewing and French. To make matters worse, Fanny Starbuck, the most empty-headed widow in Nantucket, has shown up in Hawaii and seems to be after Papa's hand in marriage! Not if Patience has anything to say about it!	320	August 24th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/932049.The_Education_of_Patience_Goodspeed
