Endgame & Act Without Words		Samuel Beckett	3.98	8980	207	Samuel Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature n 1969; his literary output of plays, novels, stories and poetry has earned him an uncontested place as one of the greatest writers of our time. "Endgame, " originally written in French and translated into English by Beckett himself, is considered by many critics to be his greatest single work. A pinnacle of Beckett's characteristic raw minimalism, it is a pure and devastating distillation of the human essence in the face of approaching death.	96	January 1st 1957			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54028.Endgame_Act_Without_Words
