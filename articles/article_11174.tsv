Conspirata	Cicero #2	Robert   Harris	4.21	13358	928	Cicero returns to continue his struggle to grasp supreme power in the state of Rome. Amidst treachery, vengeance, violence, and treason, this brilliant lawyer, orator, and philosopher finally reaches the summit of all his ambitions. Cicero becomes known as the world's first professional politician, using his compassion, and deviousness, to overcome all obstacles. - Compelling historical fiction at its best: Harris employs historical detail and an engrosing plot to give readers a man who is by turns a sympathetic hero and compromising manipulator who sets himself up for his own massive, violent ruin. This trilogy charges forward, propelled by the strength of Harris's stunningly fascinating prose. - Internationally bestselling author: "Imperium" was hailed as "quite possibly Harris's most accomplished work to date" ( "Los Angeles Times" ) and has received rave reviews from across the globe. Robert Harris's novels have sold more than 10 million copies and have been translated into thirty-seven languages.	340	November 2009	Tiro, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, Marcus Licinius Crassus, Catilina, Lentulus Sura, Lucius Lucullus, Marcus Caelius Rufus, Lucius Murena, Marcus Laeca, Julius Caesar, Marcus Tullius Cicero	Rome (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3629971-conspirata
