Crimson Rivers	Pierre Niémans #1	Jean-Christophe Grangé	4.17	7492	273	A horrifically mutilated corpse is discovered wedged in an isolated crevice. The highly-regarded but unpredictable ex-commando Pierre NiTmans is sent from Paris to the French Alps to investigate. Meanwhile, Karim Abdouf, a young Arab policeman, is trying to find out why the tomb of a young child has been desecrated. When a second body is found, high up in a glacier, the paths of the two policemen are joined in their search for the killers, a trail that embroils them with the mysterioius cult of the Crimson Rivers.	328	September 10th 1998	Pierre Niémans		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161503.Crimson_Rivers
