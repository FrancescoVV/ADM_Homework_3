Dreaming of You	The Gamblers of Craven's #2	Lisa Kleypas	4.19	34122	1788	She stood at danger's threshold—then love beckoned her in. In the shelter of her country cottage, Sara Fielding puts pen to paper to create dreams. But curiosity has enticed the prim, well-bred gentlewoman out of her safe haven—and into Derek Craven's dangerous world. A handsome, tough and tenacious Cockney, he rose from poverty to become lord of London's most exclusive gambling house—a struggle that has left Derek Craven fabulously wealthy, but hardened and suspicious. And now duty demands he allow Sara Fielding into his world—with her impeccable manners and her infuriating innocence. But here, in a perilous shadow-realm of ever-shifting fortunes, even a proper "mouse" can be transformed into a breathtaking enchantress—and a world-weary gambler can be shaken to his cynical core by the power of passion...and the promise of love.	373	January 1st 1994	Derek Craven, Sara Fielding	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330721.Dreaming_of_You
