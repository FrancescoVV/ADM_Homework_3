Born with White skin and blue eyes to the embarrassment of her darker skinned parents, Tess and Clyde, Victoria faces rejection and colorism at an early age.

Mary has seen the difficult road ahead for Victoria if she makes the wrong choices because of her appearance. Because of this, Charlotte, Mary, and Victoria’s maternal grandparents, Chandra and Ed, shower Victoria with love and encourage her unique intelligence and talents to help keep her on the right path. However, Clyde and Tess, along with Clyde’s domineering, voodoo practicing mother, Betts, begin to spitefully interfere and attempt to crush and cower Victoria’s spirit. Can Victoria withstand the vindictive influence of Betts and her parents? Will she be able to remain true to her faith and herself to overcome the trials of her childhood and find her destiny as an adult?
