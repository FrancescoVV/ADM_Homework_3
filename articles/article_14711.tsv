Outside In	Insiders #2	Maria V. Snyder	3.83	13637	988	Me? A leader? Okay, I did prove that there's more to Inside than we knew. That a whole world exists beyond this cube we live in. And finding that led to a major rebellion—between worker scrubs like me and the snobby uppers who rule our world. Make that ruled. Because of me, we're free. I thought that meant I was off the hook, and could go off on my own again—while still touching base with Riley, of course. He's the one upper I think I can trust. But then we learned that there's outside and then there is Outside. And something from Outside wants In.	328	January 3rd 2011	Riley Narelle Ashon, Trella Garrard Sanchia, Bubba Boom, Dr. Kiana Lamont		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8901953-outside-in
