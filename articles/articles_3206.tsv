Shadows	Lux #0.5	Jennifer L. Armentrout, Justine Eyre	4.14	35006	2903	The last thing Dawson Black expected was Bethany Williams. As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are…well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane. Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable. Bethany can’t deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren’t a complication she wants, she can’t stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she’s drawn in. Captivated. Lured. Loved. Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can’t stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.	179	February 20th 2012	Daemon Black, Dawson Black, Bethany Williams, Dee Black	West Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13183957-shadows
