The Modern Day Gadianton Golden Boy		Ilyan Kei Lavanway	5.00	2	1	This short story is a politically charged speculative thriller composed in 2008. It was visionary when originally written. It is alarmingly uncanny today. The story links the current usurpation of American executive power to an ancient order of secrecy that employed dark oaths to murder and get gain. Prophetic warnings both ancient and modern come into play in this provocative narration.	8	May 9th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16032311-the-modern-day-gadianton-golden-boy
