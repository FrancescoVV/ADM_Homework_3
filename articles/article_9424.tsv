The Valley of the Wolves	Crónicas de la torre #1	Laura Gallego García	4.06	7796	472	Dana attends a school of magic with only one other student. She has a great love only she can see. And only she can unravel these mysteries and become mistress of the Valley of the Wolves. Ever since Dana was a little girl, Kai has been her best friend and constant companion--even though she's the only one who can see him. Then the mysterious Maestro comes to her farm and offers her the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to study sorcery in the Valley of the Wolves. And Dana knows she must go, for the Maestro can see Kai too.... At age 27, Laura Gallego Garcia is already Spain's answer to J. K. Rowling, creating fantasies rich with magic and meaning. This is her most popular novel, a book for every kid who's ever felt set apart and everyone who finds a place all their own.	247	2000	Fenris, Dana, Kai, Suren "El Maestro", Maritta		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1146744.The_Valley_of_the_Wolves
