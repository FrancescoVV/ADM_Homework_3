A BRILLIANTLY CONCEIVED, DEEPLY DISTURBING PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER ABOUT A WOMAN HAUNTED BY SECRETS - AND THE PRICE SHE WILL PAY FOR CONCEALING THE TRUTH When a mysterious novel appears at Catherine Ravenscroft's bedside, she is curious. She has no idea who might have sent her The Perfect Stranger - or how it ended up on her nightstand. At first, she is intrigued by the suspenseful story that unfolds. And then she realizes. This isn't fiction. The Perfect Stranger recreates in vivid, unmistakable detail the day Catherine became hostage to a dark secret, a secret that only one other person knew - and that person is dead. Now that the past Catherine so desperately wants to forget is catching up with her, her world is falling apart. Plunged into a living nightmare, she knows that her only hope is to confront what really happened on that terrible day... even if the shocking truth might destroy her.	304	2015	Catherine Ravenscroft, Robert Ravenscroft, Stephen Brigstocke		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346719-disclaimer
