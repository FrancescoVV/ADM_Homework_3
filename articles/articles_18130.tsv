Great Pleasures		Edward Southgate	3.60	20	10	"How many bottoms can I top before I pass the threshold of sexual acceptability and destroy my chances of being a contender in the sweepstakes of romance?" A gay slut tells all in horny, hilarious, and honest detail! Written as confessional, sarcastic blog entries by a gay man tomcatting through the nightlife of New York City, Great Pleasures is a novel bursting with erotic exploration, delving into the repercussions and fascinations of sex as physical entertainment with graphic frankness, cheeky humor, poetic flights, mortifying vulnerability, and brutal truth.	236	April 3rd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22027599-great-pleasures
