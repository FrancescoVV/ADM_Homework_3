The Pearl		John Steinbeck	3.48	188494	8564	Like his father and grandfather before him, Kino is a poor diver, gathering pearls from the gulf beds that once brought great wealth to the kings of Spain and now provide Kino, Juana, and their infant son with meager subsistence. Then, on a day like any other, Kino emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull’s egg, as “perfect as the moon.” With the pearl comes hope, the promise of comfort and of security… A story of classic simplicity, based on a Mexican folk tale, The Pearl explores the secrets of man’s nature, greed, the darkest depths of evil, and the luminous possibilities of love.	96	1947	Kino, Juana, Coyotito, Juan Tomas, Apolonia	Nayarit (Mexico), The Gulf (Mexico), La Paz (Mexico), Santa Rosalia (Mexico) Loreto, Baja California Sur (Mexico), Santa Rosalia (Mexico), Loreto, Baja California Sur (Mexico)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5308.The_Pearl
