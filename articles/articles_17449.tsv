Crux	The Angellove Society #1	È˜erban Andrei Mazilu	4.21	33	16	The mysterious planet Crux suffers silently with a terrible ancient curse. Holy entities and scheming lords of Hell manipulate their children like pawns in an agonizingly long game of chess, while the first Cherub Innanna, creator of the realm and savior of the Nephalem, is shackled inside a pocket dimension in eternal exile. Meanwhile a savior - the mysterious Nilithar - is summoned to Crux. The events to follow haven't caught only the attention of the Cruxians, but the Angellove Society's as well. The fabled group investigates the ancient prophecy through Thomas and Andrew, a powerful half-vampire and a mage of unthinkable potential, who travel across galaxies to find the girl. Forces beyond imagination will clash in an epic battle of Light versus Darkness, as Crux changes not only its landscape, but its inhabitants as well, and the strangest and most unlikely of heroes will rise and stand against complete annihilation.	320	January 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17293464-crux
