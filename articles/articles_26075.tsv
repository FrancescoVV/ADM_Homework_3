Little does she know that a beast more fearsome than any leopard lurks in the forest...a man, one of the Chosen Ones, betrayed by his gift and tormented by his memories. John Powell has fled his fate and his duty, yet in Genny he sees his one chance for redemption. He will stalk her, kidnap her, love her as only a savage can. But when a new betrayal threatens, John must call on the powers he swore he'd never use again. Then only Genny's love can save him...if she dares to tame the one man she can't live without...	424	July 6th 2010		Russia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7150756-chains-of-ice
