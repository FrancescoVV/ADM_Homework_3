Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life		Daniel C. Dennett	4.05	14632	277	In a book that is both groundbreaking and accessible, Daniel C. Dennett, whom Chet Raymo of The Boston Globe calls "one of the most provocative thinkers on the planet," focuses his unerringly logical mind on the theory of natural selection, showing how Darwin's great idea transforms and illuminates our traditional view of humanity's place in the universe. Dennett vividly describes the theory itself and then extends Darwin's vision with impeccable arguments to their often surprising conclusions, challenging the views of some of the most famous scientists of our day.	588	May 10th 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2068.Darwin_s_Dangerous_Idea
