Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil		Hannah Arendt, Amos Elon	4.23	16225	1293	Originally appearing as a series of articles in The New Yorker , Hannah Arendt’s authoritative and stunning report on the trial of Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann sparked a flurry of debate upon its publication. This revised edition includes material that came to light after the trial, as well as Arendt’s postscript directly addressing the controversy that arose over her account. A major journalistic triumph by an intellectual of singular influence, Eichmann in Jerusalem is as shocking as it is informative—an unflinching look at one of the most unsettling and unsettled issues of the twentieth century that remains hotly debated to this day.	312	May 17th 1963	David Ben-Gurion, Reinhard Heydrich, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Müller, Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Gideon Hausner, Rudolf Kastner, Moshe Landau, Robert Servatius, Edmund Veesenmayer, Dieter Wisliceny	Jerusalem (Israel)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52090.Eichmann_in_Jerusalem
