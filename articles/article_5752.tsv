Black Lamb and Grey Falcon		Rebecca West, Christopher Hitchens	4.22	2002	304	Written on the brink of World War II, Rebecca West's classic examination of the history, people, and politics of Yugoslavia illuminates a region that is still a focus of international concern. A magnificent blend of travel journal, cultural commentary, and historical insight, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon probes the troubled history of the Balkans, and the uneasy relationships amongst its ethnic groups. The landscape and the people of Yugoslavia are brilliantly observed as West untangles the tensions that rule the country's history as well as its daily life.	1181	1941		Yugoslavia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12880.Black_Lamb_and_Grey_Falcon
