The Lost Dreamer	Witch's Brew #1	Elizabeth Paradise	3.66	56	25	Trelian is a boy who has dreams that tell of the past and future, but he doesn't know how to control them. He wants to lock the visions away, and throw away the key. Celeste is the girl who has traveled a long way to rescue him with her magic. Did the witch who took him as a boy curse his mind? Or is there another reason for the chaos caused by his blackouts? Around every corner lies an obstacle they must overcome before they can finally face the witch, and the demon she summoned to stop them.	200	February 22nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17759067-the-lost-dreamer
