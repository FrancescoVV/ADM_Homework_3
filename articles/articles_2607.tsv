Earth Abides		George R. Stewart	3.96	24454	1973	A disease of unparalleled destructive force has sprung up almost simultaneously in every corner of the globe, all but destroying the human race. One survivor, strangely immune to the effects of the epidemic, ventures forward to experience a world without man. What he ultimately discovers will prove far more astonishing than anything he'd either dreaded or hoped for.	345	1949	Isherwood Williams, Emma Williams, Joey Williams	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93269.Earth_Abides
