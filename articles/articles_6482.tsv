The Singularity is Coming: The Artificial Intelligence Explosion		Tony  Thorne	4.18	57	9	The Singularity is Coming. Will humanity survive? Many scientists predict that as early as 2024 an unprecedented event will happen that will completely change our lives. They arenâ€™t talking about global warming or nuclear war, but technological singularity. They predict that a computer with artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be able to program its own software and redesign itself. This superintelligence will exceed all human understanding and will be beyond our control. In non-technical language, The Singularity is Coming clarifies what may happen and speculates about how it may affect us. It is a compilation of information that includes comments from experts, news announcements of the latest developments, and a comprehensive reading list. In the Facts to Prophetic Fiction section is a collection of speculative science fiction pieces and short stories including: GODLIKE: The ideal companion for lonely emigrant. EQUALITY: The laws say robots must protect humans, always...? BE HAPPY WHEN WE TAKE OVER: Know your limitations. Are we on the threshold of a new golden age? Some scientists are optimistic about the singularity and predict the new intelligence will create amazing advances. It may bring about longer, healthier lives, an end to crime, and a solution to world hunger. Others wonder where our place would be in the new order. Will this superintelligence include benevolence? Are we on the verge of a new beginning for humanity, or the end of life as we know it? Read The Singularity is Coming now and decide for yourself.	190	August 25th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23791610-the-singularity-is-coming
