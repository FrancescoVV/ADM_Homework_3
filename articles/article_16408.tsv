He is condemned to live as a man, and it is only the enchanting Lady Mariah Donnington's innocence that can release him from his curse. Abandoned on her wedding night, frightened of her hidden, otherworldly heritage, Mariah is instinctively drawn to the mysterious stranger she discovers imprisoned on her husband's estate. But as the secret of Arion's magical identity unfolds, their friendship burns into a passion that cannot, must not, be consummated.
