They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.	464	April 2005	Tyler Dupree, Diane Lawton, Jason Lawton, E.D. Lawton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin
