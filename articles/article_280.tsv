Neverwhere	London Below,  The World of Neverwhere #1	Neil Gaiman	4.17	432122	22796	Under the streets of London there's a place most people could never even dream of. A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracks. Richard Mayhew, a young businessman, is going to find out more than enough about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre. And a strange destiny awaits him down here, beneath his native city: Neverwhere.	370	September 16th 1996	Richard Mayhew, Door, Marquis de Carabas, Hunter, Mr. Croup, Mr. Vandemar, Islington, Jessica Bartram, Old Bailey	London, England (United Kingdom), England, United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere
