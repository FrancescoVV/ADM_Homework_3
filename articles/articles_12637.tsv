More Than We Can Tell	Letters to the Lost #2	Brigid Kemmerer	4.32	8010	1575	Rev Fletcher is battling the demons of his past. But with loving adoptive parents by his side, he’s managed to keep them at bay...until he gets a letter from his abusive father and the trauma of his childhood comes hurtling back. Emma Blue spends her time perfecting the computer game she built from scratch, rather than facing her parents’ crumbling marriage. She can solve any problem with the right code, but when an online troll’s harassment escalates, she’s truly afraid. When Rev and Emma meet, they both long to lift the burden of their secrets and bond instantly over their shared turmoil. But when their situations turn dangerous, their trust in each other will be tested in ways they never expected. This must-read story will once again have readers falling for Brigid Kemmerer’s emotional storytelling. *While this book exists in the same universe as Letters to the Lost , it is a standalone title.*	410	March 6th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34236194-more-than-we-can-tell
