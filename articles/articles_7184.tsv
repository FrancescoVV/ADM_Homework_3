Mine to Possess	Psy-Changeling #4	Nalini Singh	4.10	27123	1415	Nalini Singh pulls away another dark layer of sheer desire, revealing passions unknown, in her latest novel about the world of the Psy. A ghost returns from a leopard changeling’s past, making him question everything—even his base animal instincts… Clay Bennett is a powerful DarkRiver sentinel, but he grew up in the slums with his human mother, never knowing his changeling father. As a young boy without the bonds of Pack, he tried to stifle his animal nature. He failed…and committed the most extreme act of violence, killing a man and losing his best friend, Talin, in the bloody aftermath. Everything good in him died the day he was told that she, too, was dead. Talin McKade barely survived a childhood drenched in bloodshed and terror. Now a new nightmare is stalking her life–the street children she works to protect are disappearing and turning up dead. Determined to keep them safe, she unlocks the darkest secret in her heart and returns to ask the help of the strongest man she knows… Clay lost Talin once. He will not let her go again, his hunger to possess her, a clawing need born of the leopard within. As they race to save the innocent, Clay and Talin must face the violent truths of their past…or lose everything that ever mattered.	328	February 5th 2008	Sascha Duncan, Lucas Hunter, Faith Nightstar, Judd Lauren, Clay Bennett, Talin McKade, Ashaya Aleine, Devraj Santos, Katya Haas, Nate Ryder, Tamsyn Mahaire, Dorian Christensen, Noor Hassan, Jonquil Duchslaya, Max Shannon, Vaughn D'Angelo	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1830755.Mine_to_Possess
