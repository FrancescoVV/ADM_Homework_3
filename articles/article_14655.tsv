The Art of the Novel		Milan Kundera, Linda Asher	3.97	5106	332	Kundera brilliantly examines the work of such important and diverse figures as Rabelais, Cervantes, Sterne, Diderot, Flaubert, Tolstoy, and Musil. He is especially penetrating on Hermann Broch, and his exploration of the world of Kafka's novels vividly reveals the comic terror of Kafka's bureaucratized universe. Kundera's discussion of his own work includes his views on the role of historical events in fiction, the meaning of action, and the creation of character in the post-psychological novel.	176	November 21st 1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28637.The_Art_of_the_Novel
