War and Peace		Leo Tolstoy, Henry Gifford, Aylmer Maude, Louise Maude, Vladimir Levstik	4.12	266195	11630	In Russia's struggle with Napoleon, Tolstoy saw a tragedy that involved all mankind. Greater than a historical chronicle, War and Peace is an affirmation of life itself, `a complete picture', as a contemporary reviewer put it, `of everything in which people find their happiness and greatness, their grief and humiliation'. Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.	1392	1867	Pierre Bezukhov, Natasha Rostova, Nikolai Rostov, Ilya Rostov, Petya Rostov, Helene Kuragina, Anna Scherer, Lise Bolkonskaya, Platon Karataev, Vasili Denisov, Anna Drubetskaya, Nikolai Bolkonsky, Kirill Bezukhov, Mikhail Kutuzov, Petr Bagration, Dolgorukov, Weyrother, Tikhon, Zherkov, Suvorov, Rostova, Joseph Alexeevich, Bezukhov, Vera Rostova, Prince Andrey Bokonsky, Boris Drubetskoy, Sonya Rostova, Napoleon Bonaparte, Anatole Kuragin, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Maria Bolkonskaya	Russia, Slavkov u Brna (Austerlitz) (Czech Republic), Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation), Olomuc (Olmütz) , 1805 (Czech Republic) Moscow (Russian Federation), Olomuc (Olmütz) (Czech Republic), Moscow (Russian Federation)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656.War_and_Peace
