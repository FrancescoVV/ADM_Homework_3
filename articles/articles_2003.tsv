Special Topics in Calamity Physics		Marisha Pessl	3.70	42798	5306	Special Topics in Calamity Physics is a darkly hilarious coming-of-age novel and a richly plotted suspense tale told through the distinctive voice of its heroine, Blue van Meer. After a childhood moving from one academic outpost to another with her father (a man prone to aphorisms and meteoric affairs), Blue is clever, deadpan, and possessed of a vast lexicon of literary, political, philosophical, and scientific knowledge—and is quite the cineaste to boot. In her final year of high school at the elite (and unusual) St. Gallway School in Stockton, North Carolina, Blue falls in with a charismatic group of friends and their captivating teacher, Hannah Schneider. But when the drowning of one of Hannah's friends and the shocking death of Hannah herself lead to a confluence of mysteries, Blue is left to make sense of it all with only her gimlet-eyed instincts and cultural references to guide—or misguide—her.	514	August 3rd 2006	Blue van Meer, Victor Moats, Fayonette Harper, Smoke Wyannoch Harvey, Natasha Alicia Bridges van Meer, Pa Havermeyer, Howie Valerio, Frank Fletcher, Jefferson Whitestone, Ms. Simpson, Wilson Gnut, Norvel Owen, Arnie Sanderson, Ms. Gershon, Alfred Johnson, Roy Withers, Eugenia Sturds, Violet May Martinez, Lonny Felix, Andreo Verduga, Lee Sanjay Song	Stockton, North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3483.Special_Topics_in_Calamity_Physics
