METATOMICS: THE GRAND DESIGN		Todd  Fischer	4.83	12	8	Metatomics is the study of how to speak truly of God and of all things in relation to God through science, hypothesis and research. Bringing these methods together is called "mechanics" and is important for seekers of fact and faith trying to establish a connection to God. It can be used within the framework of organized religion or followed independently as a Christian philosophy or spirituality. Metatomics takes modern religion to the next level – evolving the spirituality of the individual, and not adherence to restrictive and frequently hateful dogma and the tired rules and laws written by church leadership that can’t be related to in the modern age or beyond. One of the main tenets of Metatomics is the spiritual growth of your Soul. We must all find our own path in life, through the teachings of whichever religion meets our individual needs. We must remember that we’re all human beings, struggling, learning and growing, and only by working together can we build a better future for ourselves and our children.	474	2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45176456-metatomics
