The Buried Symbol	The Runes of Issalia #1	Jeffrey L. Kohanek	3.91	785	108	Buried away for centuries, a forgotten magic lurks...waiting to return They tell Unchosen, "Accept your fate and you'll be rewarded in the next life." The threat of execution is their recourse. Rejecting his role as an outcast, Brock risks his life and obtains a false rune, marking him a member of the Empire's ruling class. Under a veil of deception and backed by natural talent, the teen then schemes his way into a school where the Empireâ€™s future leaders are trained. Within the Academy, a legendary school of magic, science, politics, and combat, he uncovers secrets kept hidden for centuries - secrets that expose cracks in the foundation of Empire society. Among his discoveries is a long forgotten magic, powerful and dangerous - a magic he is determined to wield. Caught between his continued charade and a desire to tame his frightening new abilities, one misstep on either front could destroy him.	356	May 5th 2016		Issalia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43735667-the-buried-symbol
