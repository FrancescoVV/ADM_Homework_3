"Sometimes, the lies we tell ourselves are more destructive than the truth we hide from others." In Relentless, college student Claire Nixon and surfer Adam Parker each had a painful past too heavy to carry alone. Claire tried to push Adam away, but Adam's relentless pursuit of her heart and her secrets made her walls come crumbling down. But now Claire's attending college a hundred miles away from Adam. With their new relationship already hanging by a thread, Adam is sent to Hawaii on business. And Claire's first love, rock star Chris Knight, is back in her life. Chris wants his ex-girlfriend back. Both he and Claire know that only Chris has the power to mend the final missing piece of Claire's shattered heart. But Claire's strength is tested as she is forced to confront the demons she's been running from for more than a year. Now Claire must choose between a long-distance relationship with Adam and a second chance at love, family, and home with Chris.	322	May 3rd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21732656-pieces-of-you
