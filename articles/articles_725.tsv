Macbeth		William Shakespeare	3.90	676785	11261	One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland. At first sceptical, he’s urged on by the ruthless, single-minded ambitions of Lady Macbeth, who suffers none of her husband’s doubt. But seeing the prophecy through to the bloody end leads them both spiralling into paranoia, tyranny, madness, and murder. This shocking tragedy - a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake - is, to this day, one of Shakespeare’s most popular and influential masterpieces.	249	1606	Fleance, Seyward, Young Siward, Seyton, First Witch, Second Witch, Third Witch, Lady Macduff, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth	Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8852.Macbeth
