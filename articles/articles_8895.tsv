The Farseer Trilogy	The Farseer Trilogy #1-3	Robin Hobb	4.37	18725	339	This bundle includes Assassin’s Apprentice (book one), Royal Assassin (book two) and Assassin’s Quest (book three). In a faraway land where members of the royal family are named for the virtues they embody, one young boy will become a walking enigma. Born on the wrong side of the sheets, Fitz, son of Chivalry Farseer, is a royal bastard cast out into the world friendless and lonely. Only his magical link with animals – the old art known as the Wit – gives him solace and companionship. But the Wit, if used too often, is a perilous magic, and one abhorred by the nobility. So when Fitz is finally adopted into the royal household, he must give up his old ways and embrace a new life of weaponry, scribing, courtly manners; and how to kill a man secretly, as he trains to become a royal assassin… Enter the extraordinary world of Robin Hobb’s magnificent Farseer Trilogy.	1952	May 16th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10762697-the-farseer-trilogy
