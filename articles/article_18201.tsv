Mary Credence wants to be a modern day Joan of Arc battling the skeptical world around her. But when the ardent virgin finds herself pregnant, she’s thrust into a much bigger fight than she ever imagined. Is Mary hiding a romantic tryst in an effort to protect her father’s political career, or is her baby a true modern miracle? With the help of a talented writer and a surprising medical finding, Mary attempts to convince the world of her gift and to convert a nation of cynics into believers. 'Now and at the Hour of Our Death' challenges our notions of faith and science, all while asking the eternal question: What do you believe?	423	September 2nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630964-now-and-at-the-hour-of-our-death
