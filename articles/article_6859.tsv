Gantenbein		Max Frisch, Michael Bullock	4.03	1948	72	A stranger walks out of a bar and is later found dead at the wheel of his car. The narrator creates the story of this man -- or, rather, two stories, based on the two personae that he has imagined. One of these is named Enderlin; the other, Gantenbein. Originally published as A Wilderness of Mirrors.	304	1964			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74183.Gantenbein
