Am I Normal Yet?	The Spinster Club #1	Holly Bourne	4.23	11564	1808	All Evie wants is to be normal. She’s almost off her meds and at a new college where no one knows her as the girl-who-went-crazy. She’s even going to parties and making friends. There’s only one thing left to tick off her list… But relationships are messy – especially relationships with teenage guys. They can make any girl feel like they’re going mad. And if Evie can’t even tell her new friends Amber and Lottie the truth about herself, how will she cope when she falls in love?	434	August 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23592235-am-i-normal-yet
