Dreaming My Animal Selves/Le Songe de Mes Ames Animales		Helene Cardona	4.79	99	47	Dreaming My Animal Selves is an intriguingly surreal journey through myth, legend, fantasy, and more - all guided by a shape-shifting narrator searching far and wide for cosmic unity within the discontinuous landscape of dream and the dreamy, fragmented quality of the everyday world. The dual-language text (English and French) works to heighten the narrator's shifting perceptions, symbol by symbol, vision by vision. Winner of the USA Best Book Award in Poetry, the Pinnacle Book Award for Best Bilingual Poetry Book, and the Reader's Favorite Book Award in Poetry. International Book Awards and Julie Suk Award in Poetry Finalist.	80	2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17296121-dreaming-my-animal-selves-le-songe-de-mes-ames-animales
