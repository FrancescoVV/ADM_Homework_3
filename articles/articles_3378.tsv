The Enemy	The Enemy #1	Charlie Higson	4.09	21536	2381	Charlie Higson's The Enemy is the first in a jaw-dropping zombie horror series for teens. Everyone over the age of fourteen has succumbed to a deadly zombie virus and now the kids must keep themselves alive. When the sickness came, every parent, police officer, politician - every adult fell ill. The lucky ones died. The others are crazed, confused and hungry. Only children under fourteen remain, and they're fighting to survive. Now there are rumours of a safe place to hide. And so a gang of children begin their quest across London, where all through the city - down alleyways, in deserted houses, underground - the grown-ups lie in wait. But can they make it there - alive? This edition contains the first chapter of the second book The Dead .	407	September 1st 2009	Deke, Lewis, Ollie, Achilleus (From The Enemy), Callum, David King, Jester, Maxie, Blue, Arran, Small Sam, Whitney, Freak	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8540357-the-enemy
