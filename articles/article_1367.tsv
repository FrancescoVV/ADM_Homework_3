The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter		Carson McCullers	3.98	92992	6401	Carson McCullers’ prodigious first novel was published to instant acclaim when she was just twenty-three. Set in a small town in the middle of the deep South, it is the story of John Singer, a lonely deaf-mute, and a disparate group of people who are drawn towards his kind, sympathetic nature. The owner of the café where Singer eats every day, a young girl desperate to grow up, an angry drunkard, a frustrated black doctor: each pours their heart out to Singer, their silent confidant, and he in turn changes their disenchanted lives in ways they could never imagine.	359	1940	John Singer, Spiros Antonapoulos, Biff Brannon, Jake Blount, Mick Kelly, Benedict Copeland		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37380.The_Heart_Is_a_Lonely_Hunter
