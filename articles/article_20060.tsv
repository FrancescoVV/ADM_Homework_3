Why the Chimes Rang		Raymond Macdonald Alden, Mayo Bunker	4.32	76	14	Described as "the one perfect book for children" when it was first published in 1909, Why the Chimes Rang quickly became one of America's favorite Christmas books. Now, this time-honored classic, a beautiful tale that conveys the very spirit of giving, has been re-published, illustrated with full-color restorations of the original engravings, to take its place again as a cherished Christmas tradition.	38	January 1st 1908			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114281.Why_the_Chimes_Rang
