Labyrinth	Languedoc #1	Kate Mosse	3.58	48062	3123	In the Pyrenees mountains near Carcassonne, Alice, a volunteer at an archaeological dig, stumbles into a cave and makes a startling discovery-two crumbling skeletons, strange writings on the walls, and the pattern of a labyrinth. Eight hundred years earlier, on the eve of a brutal crusade that will rip apart southern France, a young woman named Alais is given a ring and a mysterious book for safekeeping by her father. The book, he says, contains the secret of the true Grail, and the ring, inscribed with a labyrinth, will identify a guardian of the Grail. Now, as crusading armies gather outside the city walls of Carcassonne, it will take a tremendous sacrifice to keep the secret of the labyrinth safe.	515	2005	Alice Tanner, Alaïs du Mas, Paul Authié, Bertrand Pelletier, Jehan Congost, Esclarmonde de Servian, Guy d'Evreux, Guilhem du Mas, Marie-Cécile de l'Oradore, Oriane Congost-Pelletier, Sajhë de Servian, Will Franklin, Raymond-Roger Trencavel	France, Carcassonne (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14975.Labyrinth
