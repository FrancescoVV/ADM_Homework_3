The Book Thief		Markus Zusak	4.37	1844501	113480	SPECIAL 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION with exclusive extra behind-the-scenes material from the author It is 1939. In Nazi Germany, the country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier - and will become busier still. By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed forever when she picks up a single object, abandoned in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook , and this is her first act of book thievery. So begins Liesel's love affair with books and words, and soon she is stealing from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library . . . wherever there are books to be found. But these are dangerous times, and when Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, nothing will ever be the same again. In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time. Now a major film from Twentieth-Century Fox starring Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson.	584	September 1st 2005	Liesel Meminger, Hans Hubermann, Rudy Steiner, Rosa Hubermann, Max Vandenburg, Tommy MÃ¼ller, Ilsa Hermann, Frau Holtzapfel	Molching (Germany), Germany	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief
