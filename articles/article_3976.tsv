The Jane Austen Book Club		Karen Joy Fowler	3.11	67241	4496	The Extraordinary New York Times Bestseller In California's central valley, five women and one man join to discuss Jane Austen's novels. Over the six months they get together, marriages are tested, affairs begin, unsuitable arrangements become suitable, and love happens. With her eye for the frailties of human behavior and her ear for the absurdities of social intercourse, Karen Joy Fowler has never been wittier nor her characters more appealing. The result is a delicious dissection of modern relationships. Dedicated Austenites will delight in unearthing the echoes of Austen that run through the novel, but most readers will simply enjoy the vision and voice that, despite two centuries of separation, unite two great writers of brilliant social comedy.	288	April 22nd 2004	Bernadette, Sylvia, Allegra, Jocelyn, Prudie, Grigg	Davis, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2152.The_Jane_Austen_Book_Club
