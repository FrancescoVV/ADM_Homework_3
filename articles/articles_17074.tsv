Araminta Station	Cadwal Chronicles #1	Jack Vance	4.07	1016	68	The planet Cadwal is forever set aside as a natural perserve, owned and administered by the Naturalist Society of Earth, and inhabited by a very limited number of skilled human scientists and their families. But this system has been complicated by the passing centuries, and has become a byzantine culture where every place in the Houses of Cadwal is the object of savage competition. In Araminta Station , the first volume of The Cadwal Chronicles , Jack Vance has constructed a brilliant, complex tale of revenge and murder, of love and alien intrigue, and set it glittering among the stars of the Purple Rose System.	554	1987			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40892.Araminta_Station
