Wool	Wool  #1	Hugh Howey, Minnie Goode	4.12	76421	4392	Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside. Or you'll get what you wish for.	58	July 29th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287209-wool
