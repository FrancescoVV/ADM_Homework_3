The Buccaneers		Edith Wharton, Marion Mainwaring	3.89	5653	416	Nan and Jinny St George have both wealth and beauty in generous supply. In the New York society of the 1870s, however, only those with old money can achieve the status of the elite, and it is here that the sisters seem doomed to failure. Nan's new governess, Laura Testvalley, herself an outsider, takes pity on their plight and launches them instead on the unsuspecting British aristocracy. Lords, dukes, marquesses and MPs, it seems, not only appreciate beauty, but also the money that New York's nouveaux riches can supply. A love story of love and marriage among the old and new moneyed classes, The Buccaneers is a delicately perceptive portrayal of a world on the brink of change.	406	1938	Annabel "Nan" St. George, Virginia "Jinny" St. George, Conchita "Connie" Closson, Elizabeth "Lizzy" Elmsworth		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/856190.The_Buccaneers
