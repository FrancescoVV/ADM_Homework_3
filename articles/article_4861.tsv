The Sicilian	The Godfather #2	Mario Puzo	3.98	20472	726	After Mario Puzo wrote his internationally acclaimed The Godfather, he has often been imitated but never equaled. Puzo's classic novel, The Sicilian, stands as a cornerstone of his work--a lushly romantic, unforgettable tale of bloodshed, justice, and treachery. . . . The year is 1950. Michael Corleone is nearing the end of his exile in Sicily. The Godfather has commanded Michael to bring a young Sicilian bandit named Salvatore Giuliano back with him to America. But Giuliano is a man entwined in a bloody web of violence and vendettas. In Sicily, Giuliano is a modern day Robin Hood who has defied corruption--and defied the Cosa Nostra. Now, in the land of mist-shrouded mountains and ancient ruins, Michael Corleone's fate is entwined with the dangerous legend of Salvatore Giuliano: warrior, lover, and the ultimate Siciliano.	416	November 1984	Don Vito Corleone, Michael "Mike" Corleone, Peter "Pete" Clemenza, Michael "Mike" Corleone, Santino "Sonny" Corleone, Constanzia "Connie" Corleone, Fredo "Freddie" Corleone, Tom Hagen, Johnny Fontane, Peter "Pete" Clemenza, Al Neri, Rocco Lampone, Salvatore 'Turi' Giuliano	Sicily (Italy), United States of America, New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22026.The_Sicilian
