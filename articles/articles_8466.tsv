Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings		Philip A. Fisher, Kenneth L. Fisher	4.14	10687	293	Widely respected and admired, Philip Fisher is among the most influential investors of all time. His investment philosophies, introduced almost forty years ago, are not only studied and applied by today's financiers and investors, but are also regarded by many as gospel. This book is invaluable reading and has been since it was first published in 1958. The updated paperback retains the investment wisdom of the original edition and includes the perspectives of the author's son Ken Fisher, an investment guru in his own right in an expanded preface and introduction "I sought out Phil Fisher after reading his Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits ...A thorough understanding of the business, obtained by using Phil's techniques...enables one to make intelligent investment commitments." -- Warren Buffet	292	November 30th 1957			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25574.Common_Stocks_and_Uncommon_Profits_and_Other_Writings
