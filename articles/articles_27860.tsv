Break Me	Obsession #2	Laura Bailey	3.31	174	9	Would you kill for the one you love? I crashed into his life, ripped apart the walls he had so carefully erected...fueled a passion that he never knew could exist, but his troubled past has come back to haunt us. I yearn to know his secrets, yearn for him to surrender to me as I have surrendered to him. Whatever it takes, he says he will protect me... but he will never let me in.	59	October 7th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18798988-break-me
