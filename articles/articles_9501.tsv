Uninvited	Uninvited #1	Sophie Jordan	3.87	12493	1844	When Davy Hamilton's tests come back positive for Homicidal Tendency Syndrome (HTS)—aka the kill gene—she loses everything. Her boyfriend ditches her, her parents are scared of her, and she can forget about her bright future at Juilliard. Davy doesn't feel any different, but genes don't lie. One day she will kill someone. Only Sean, a fellow HTS carrier, can relate to her new life. Davy wants to trust him; maybe he's not as dangerous as he seems. Or maybe Davy is just as deadly.	384	January 28th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13645645-uninvited
