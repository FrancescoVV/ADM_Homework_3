Every Which Way But Dead	The Hollows #3	Kim Harrison	4.28	66604	1485	T here's no witch in Cincinnati tougher, sexier, or more screwed up than bounty hunter Rachel Morgan, who's already put her love life and soul in dire jeopardy through her determined efforts to bring criminal night creatures to justice. Between "runs," she has her hands full fending off the attentions of her blood-drinking partner, keeping a deadly secret from her backup, and resisting a hot new vamp suitor. Rachel must also take a stand in the war that's raging in the city's underworld, since she helped put away its former vampire kingpin - and made a deal with a powerful demon to do so that could cost her an eternity of pain, torment, and degradation. And now her dark "master" is coming to collect his due.	501	June 28th 2005	Rachel Morgan, Ivy Tamwood, Jenks, Trent Kalamack, Algaliarept, Kisten Felps, Nick Sparagmos, David Hue, Ceri, Newt, Saladan, Jonathan, Quen	Cincinnati, Ohio (United States), Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30263.Every_Which_Way_But_Dead
