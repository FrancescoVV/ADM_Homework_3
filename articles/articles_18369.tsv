Amor, Sexo y Dharma		Arthur Jeon	4.13	52	12	Drawing on the teachings of the dharma, this guide to modern romance provides a fresh way of looking at relationships that doesn’t rely on someday finding “the one.” Instead, it encourages readers to embrace the opportunities to love in the present, no matter what the circumstances. Applying the timeless wisdom of the dharma to the joy, challenges, and heartache of contemporary romance, this book offers a better way to be in love and will help readers achieve the true love they always imagined was possible.	363	May 24th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328998.Sex_Love_and_Dharma
