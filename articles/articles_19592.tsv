His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, The Amber Spyglass	His Dark Materials #1-3	Philip Pullman	4.25	144589	5194	The only hardcover omnibus of the best-selling and award-winning fantasy trilogy, in a Contemporary Classics edition. Philip Pullman's trilogy is a masterpiece that transcends genre and appeals to readers of all ages. His heroine, Lyra, is an orphan living in a parallel universe in which science, theology, and magic are entwined. The epic story that takes us through the three novels is not only a spellbinding adventure featuring armored polar bears, magical devices, witches, and daemons, it is also an audacious and profound reimagining of Milton's Paradise Lost that has already inspired a number of serious books of literary criticism. Like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis before him, Pullman has invented a richly detailed and marvelously imagined world, complex and thought-provoking enough to enthrall adults as well as younger readers. An utterly entrancing blend of metaphysical speculation and bravura storytelling, His Dark Materials is a monumental and enduring achievement.	1102	November 2000	Lyra Belacqua, Will Parry, Mary Malone, Pantalaimon, Lord Asriel, Iorek Byrnison, Iofur Raknison, Marisa Coulter, Lee Scoresby, Roger Parslow, Stanislaus Grumman, Serafina Pekkala	Oxford, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18116.His_Dark_Materials
