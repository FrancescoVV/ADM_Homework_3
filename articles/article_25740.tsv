The Foundations of Arithmetic: A Logico-Mathematical Enquiry into the Concept of Number		Gottlob Frege, J.L. Austin	4.20	835	40	The Foundations of Arithmetic is undoubtedly the best introduction to Frege's thought; it is here that Frege expounds the central notions of his philosophy, subjecting the views of his predecessors and contemporaries to devastating analysis. The book represents the first philosophically sound discussion of the concept of number in Western civilization. It profoundly influenced developments in the philosophy of mathematics and in general ontology.	144	1884			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/372100.The_Foundations_of_Arithmetic
