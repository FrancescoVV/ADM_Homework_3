Midnight's Mask	Forgotten Realms: Erevis Cale #3	Paul S. Kemp	4.30	1728	36	The shadows deepen in every corner of the Realms. The sun no longer shines on a man who has embraced the darkness within him. The day's opposite finds Erevis Cale so far along the path away from his own humanity, he may never again walk as a man. In the end, to be Chosen by a god like Mask is more curse than blessing...	320	November 1st 2005	Riven Drasek, Jak Fleet, Erevis Cale, Magadon Kest		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/291488.Midnight_s_Mask
