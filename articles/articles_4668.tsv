Everything That Rises Must Converge: Stories		Flannery O'Connor, Robert Fitzgerald	4.25	18132	1216	Flannery O'Connor was working on Everything That Rises Must Converge at the time of her death. This collection is an exquisite legacy from a genius of the American short story, in which she scrutinizes territory familiar to her readers: race, faith, and morality. The stories encompass the comic and the tragic, the beautiful and the grotesque; each carries her highly individual stamp and could have been written by no one else.	269	1965			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218659.Everything_That_Rises_Must_Converge
