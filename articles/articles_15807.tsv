The Moor	Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes #4	Laurie R. King	3.94	15270	979	In the eerie wasteland of Dartmoor, Sherlock Holmes summons his devoted wife and partner, Mary Russell, from her studies at Oxford to aid the investigation of a death and some disturbing phenomena of a decidedly supernatural origin. Through the mists of the moor there have been sightings of a spectral coach made of bones carrying a woman long-ago accused of murdering her husband--and of a hound with a single glowing eye. Returning to the scene of one of his most celebrated cases, The Hound of the Baskervilles, Holmes and Russell investigate a mystery darker and more unforgiving than the moors themselves.	320	December 31st 1998	Mary Russell, Sabine Baring-Gould, Sherlock Holmes (Russell & Holmes series)	Dartmoor, Devon, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/184059.The_Moor
