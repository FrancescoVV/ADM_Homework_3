When I Found You	San Diego K-9 Unit #3	Kate  James	4.26	70	40	Is she part of the solution…or the problem? It could be a terrorist threat. Or is it some other sinister plot? An unprecedented rash of security breaches at San Diego's international airport is putting passengers at risk and bringing the competence of the airport's chief of security, Ariana Atkins, into question. With explosives the weapon of choice, police K-9 unit captain Logan O'Connor and his bomb detection dog, Boomer, might be Ariana's best, if not only, line of defense. Logan is certain his belief in Ariana, and his growing love for her, aren't misplaced…but it wouldn't be the first time he's misjudged someone's intentions.	365	July 1st 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29492747-when-i-found-you
