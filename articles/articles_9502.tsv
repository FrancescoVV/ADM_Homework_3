Nails		D.M. Samson	4.93	14	1	There is little one can say about the plot. Succinctly put, it is the story of one day in the life of a car mechanic. Admittedly, not much in itself. But it's hard, raw, violent, sexy, sensitive, funny, poetic and philosophical to boot. It's a page-turner that grabs you by the short and curlies. If you liked the work of Charles Bukowski, then you'll love this book. See www.davidmsamson.com	132	May 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21340682-nails
