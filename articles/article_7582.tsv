The Island of the Day Before		Umberto Eco	3.47	13725	653	After a violent storm in the South Pacific in the year 1643, Roberto della Griva finds himself shipwrecked-on a ship. Swept from the Amaryllis, he has managed to pull himself aboard the Daphne, anchored in the bay of a beautiful island. The ship is fully provisioned, he discovers, but the crew is missing. As Roberto explores the different cabinets in the hold, he remembers chapters from his youth: Ferrante, his imaginary evil brother; the siege of Casale, that meaningless chess move in the Thirty Years' War in which he lost his father and his illusions; and the lessons given him on Reasons of State, fencing, the writing of love letters, and blasphemy. In this fascinating, lyrical tale, Umberto Eco tells of a young dreamer searching for love and meaning; and of a most amazing old Jesuit who, with his clocks and maps, has plumbed the secrets of longitudes, the four moons of Jupiter, and the Flood.	528	September 1994	Roberto della Griva, Roberto de la Grive, Tycho Brahe, Monsieur Gaffarel, Arth√©nice, Escondida, Marquis de Cinq-Mars, Monsieur de Saint-Savin, Monsieur de Toiras		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10506.The_Island_of_the_Day_Before
