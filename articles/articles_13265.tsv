Darker	Fifty Shades as Told by Christian #2	E.L. James	4.12	37701	2592	E L James revisits the world of Fifty Shades with a deeper and darker take on the love story that has enthralled millions of readers around the globe. Their scorching, sensual affair ended in heartbreak and recrimination, but Christian Grey cannot get Anastasia Steele out of his mind, or his blood. Determined to win her back, he tries to suppress his darkest desires and his need for complete control, and to love Ana on her own terms. But the horrors of his childhood still haunt him, and Ana’s scheming boss, Jack Hyde, clearly wants her for himself. Can Christian’s confidant and therapist, Dr. Flynn, help him face down his demons? Or will the possessiveness of Elena, his seducer, and the deranged devotion of Leila, his former submissive, drag Christian down into the past? And if Christian does win Ana back, can a man so dark and damaged ever hope to keep her?	546	November 28th 2017	Anastasia Steele, Christian Grey, Jason Taylor, Kate Kavanagh, Elliot Grey, Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey, Carrick Grey, Elena Lincoln	Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32024902-darker
