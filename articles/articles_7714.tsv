Twenty Years After	The D'Artagnan Romances #2	Alexandre Dumas, David Coward, Auguste Maquet	4.05	20488	621	'At this game, whoever does not kill is killed.' Twenty Years After (1845), the sequel to The Three Musketeers , is a supreme creation of suspense and heroic adventure. Two decades have passed since the musketeers triumphed over Cardinal Richelieu and Milady. Time has weakened their resolve, and dispersed their loyalties. But treasons and stratagems still cry out for justice: civil war endangers the throne of France, while in England Cromwell threatens to send Charles I to the scaffold. Dumas brings his immortal quartet out of retirement to cross swords with time, the malevolence of men, and the forces of history. But their greatest test is a titanic struggle with the son of Milady, who wears the face of Evil.	788	1845	D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, Oliver Cromwell, Anne of Austria, Cardinal Mazarino, Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7184.Twenty_Years_After
