The Blind Side		Michael   Lewis	4.16	85114	3920	When we first meet Michael Oher, he is one of thirteen children by a mother addicted to crack; he does not know his real name, his father, his birthday, or how to read or write. He takes up football and school after a rich, white, Evangelical family plucks him from the streets. Then two great forces alter Oher: the family's love and the evolution of professional football itself into a game in which the quarterback must be protected at any cost. Our protagonist becomes the priceless package of size, speed, and agility necessary to guard the quarterback's greatest vulnerability: his blind side.	339	September 17th 2006		Memphis, Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/817791.The_Blind_Side
