Panic	Panic #1	Lauren Oliver	3.56	51196	6343	Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a dead-end town of 12,000 people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do. Heather never thought she would compete in Panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher. She’d never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought. Dodge has never been afraid of Panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game, he’s sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he’s not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for. For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them—and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.	408	March 4th 2014	Dodge Mason, Heather Nill, Natalie Velez, Bishop, Heather, Officer Sadowski, Dayna, Ricky, Ray Hanrahan, Zev Keller, Lily, Billy Kelly, Matt Hepley	Carp	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17565845-panic
