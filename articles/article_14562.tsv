The Battle Begins	Unnaturals #1	Devon Hughes, Owen Richardson	4.32	197	36	Perfect for fans of the Animorphs and Warriors series, Devon Hughes's exhilarating debut is full of friendship, heroism, high stakes, and epic adventure. Castor has always been a stray, prowling with his pack in the back alleys of Lion's Head. That is, until the day that he's captured and taken to a dark laboratory full of terrifying creatures. They're called Unnaturals, and they're made to fight. Soon Castor is transformed from a mutt into a powerful beast with huge eagle wingsâ€”and he's thrust into the fighting ring. He knows he'll need all of his courage to survive. But it will take unexpected human and animal allies and something even more than courage for him to save the Unnaturals....	352	October 6th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24603808-the-battle-begins
