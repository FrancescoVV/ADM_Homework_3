Fallen Crest High	Fallen Crest High #1	Tijan	4.10	49184	3305	Mason and Logan Kade are two brothers who did their own thing. They were rich and expected to attend her school, Fallen Crest Academy. They chose public school and now Samantha has to live with them. The problem is that she doesn't care at all: about them, about her friends, about her cheating boyfriend, or even about her parent's divorce. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe change is a good thing.	375	October 31st 2012	Logan Kade, Mason Kade, Samantha		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16134551-fallen-crest-high
