The Vagabond Vicar	Hearts of Amberley #1	Charlotte Brentwood	3.76	72	37	Vicar William Brook is biding his time in the small village of Amberley, desperate for a missionary posting overseas. He hadn’t counted on being captivated by Cecilia Grant, a free-spirited artist, who challenges him at every turn. Cecilia is destined to marry a local aristocrat – or at least that’s what her mother thinks. But the darkly handsome new vicar seems to understand her in a way no one ever has, and she finds herself drawn to him even as he holds her at arm’s length. As their relationship blossoms, dark secrets are revealed in Amberley and a scandal from William’s past may see the end of both his career and their love. The Vagabond Vicar is an unashamedly romantic historical novel you'll fall in love with. If you love Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer, can't get enough of Downton Abbey or Cranford, or just prefer old-fashioned boy-meets-girl stories, try reading Charlotte Brentwood. Sensuality level: sweet (only kissing) Please note, although there is some mention of religious subject matter due to the hero's occupation, this is not an "inspirational" novel.
