Immortal Beloved	Immortal Beloved #1	Cate Tiernan	4.10	13920	1420	Nastasya has spent the last century living as a spoiled, drugged-out party girl. She feels nothing and cares for no one. But when she witnesses her best friend, a Dark Immortal, torture a human, she realizes something's got to change. She seeks refuge at a rehab for wayward immortals, where she meets the gorgeous, undeniably sexy Reyn, who seems inexplicably linked to her past. Nastasya finally begins to deal with life, and even feels safe--until the night she learns that someone wants her dead.	407	September 7th 2010	Nastasya Crowe, Reyn		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7823549-immortal-beloved
