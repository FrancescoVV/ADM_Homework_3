Deadeye Dick		Kurt Vonnegut Jr.	3.82	24736	872	Deadeye Dick is Kurt Vonnegut’s funny, chillingly satirical look at the death of innocence. Amid a true Vonnegutian host of horrors—a double murder, a fatal dose of radioactivity, a decapitation, an annihilation of a city by a neutron bomb—Rudy Waltz, aka Deadeye Dick, takes us along on a zany search for absolution and happiness. Here is a tale of crime and punishment that makes us rethink what we believe . . . and who we say we are.	271	1982	Rudy Waltz		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9598.Deadeye_Dick
