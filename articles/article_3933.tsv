Why We Broke Up		Daniel Handler, Maira Kalman	3.47	53316	7185	I'm telling you why we broke up, Ed. I'm writing it in this letter, the whole truth of why it happened. Min Green and Ed Slaterton are breaking up, so Min is writing Ed a letter and giving him a box. Inside the box is why they broke up. Two bottle caps, a movie ticket, a folded note, a box of matches, a protractor, books, a toy truck, a pair of ugly earrings, a comb from a motel room, and every other item collected over the course of a giddy, intimate, heartbreaking relationship. Item after item is illustrated and accounted for, and then the box, like a girlfriend, will be dumped.	354	December 27th 2011	Minerva "Min" Green, Ed Slaterton, Al Leopardi, Joan Slaterton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10798418-why-we-broke-up
