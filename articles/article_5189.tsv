Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library	Mr. Lemoncello's Library #1	Chris Grabenstein	4.13	41480	5662	A New York Times Bestseller Kyle Keeley is the class clown, popular with most kids, (if not the teachers), and an ardent fan of all games: board games, word games, and particularly video games. His hero, Luigi Lemoncello, the most notorious and creative gamemaker in the world, just so happens to be the genius behind the building of the new town library. Lucky Kyle wins a coveted spot to be one of the first 12 kids in the library for an overnight of fun, food, and lots and lots of games. But when morning comes, the doors remain locked. Kyle and the other winners must solve every clue and every secret puzzle to find the hidden escape route. And the stakes are very high. In this cross between Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and A Night in the Museum, Agatha Award winner Chris Grabenstein uses rib-tickling humor to create the perfect tale for his quirky characters. Old fans and new readers will become enthralled with the crafty twists and turns of this ultimate library experience.	304	June 25th 2013	Kyle Keeley, Mike Keeley, Curtis Keeley, Dr. Yanina Zinchenko, Luigi Lemoncello, Sierra Russell, Akimi Hughes, Haley Dailey, Charles Chilltington, Miguel Fernandez, Andrew Peckelman, Mrs. Gail Tobin, Rose Vermett, Yazmine Smith-Snyder, Sean Keegan, Bridget Wadge, Clarence (Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library), Clement (Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library), James Willoughby III	Alexandriaville, Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16054808-escape-from-mr-lemoncello-s-library
