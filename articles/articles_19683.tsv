Acid Casuals		Nicholas Blincoe	3.33	54	4	Estela, who used to be Paul but has just had the operation, returns to Manchester on a business trip. The business - to kill her ex-boss, a club owner and money launderer - entails encounters with a whole posse of Mancunian lowlifes, dodgy bouncers, bent coppers, Moss Side gangsters, DJs and all kinds of drugs and sex. The dialogue is sharp, the setting realistically slimy, the action well over the top.	230	1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202116.Acid_Casuals
