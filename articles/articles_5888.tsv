Tell Me Three Things		Julie Buxbaum	4.08	49740	7103	Everything about Jessie is wrong. At least, that’s what it feels like during her first week of junior year at her new ultra-intimidating prep school in Los Angeles. Just when she’s thinking about hightailing it back to Chicago, she gets an email from a person calling themselves Somebody/Nobody (SN for short), offering to help her navigate the wilds of Wood Valley High School. Is it an elaborate hoax? Or can she rely on SN for some much-needed help? It’s been barely two years since her mother’s death, and because her father eloped with a woman he met online, Jessie has been forced to move across the country to live with her stepmonster and her pretentious teenage son. In a leap of faith—or an act of complete desperation—Jessie begins to rely on SN, and SN quickly becomes her lifeline and closest ally. Jessie can’t help wanting to meet SN in person. But are some mysteries better left unsolved?	328	April 5th 2016	Jessie, Ethan, Theo, Adriana, Agnes, Liam, Scarlett	Los Angeles, California (United States), Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893582-tell-me-three-things
