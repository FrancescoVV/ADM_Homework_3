Empress Orchid	Empress Orchid #1	Anchee Min	3.88	22044	1335	To rescue her family from poverty and avoid marrying her slope-shouldered cousin, seventeen-year-old Orchid competes to be one of the Emperor's wives. When she is chosen as a lower-ranking concubine she enters the erotically charged and ritualised Forbidden City. But beneath its immaculate fa√ßade lie whispers of murders and ghosts, and the thousands of concubines will stoop to any lengths to bear the Emperor's son. Orchid trains herself in the art of pleasuring a man, bribes her way into the royal bed, and seduces the monarch, drawing the attention of dangerous foes. Little does she know that China will collapse around her, and that she will be its last Empress.	368	2003	Tzu Hsi, Emperor Hsien Feng, Prince Kung	The Forbidden City (China), Beijing (China), China	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139254.Empress_Orchid
