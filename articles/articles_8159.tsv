The Manuscript Found in Saragossa		Jan Potocki, Ian Maclean	4.11	2825	261	Alphonse, a young Walloon officer, is travelling to join his regiment in Madrid in 1739. But he soon finds himself mysteriously detained at a highway inn in the strange and varied company of thieves, brigands, cabbalists, noblemen, coquettes and gypsies, whose stories he records over sixty-six days. The resulting manuscript is discovered some forty years later in a sealed casket, from which tales of characters transformed through disguise, magic and illusion, of honour and cowardice, of hauntings and seductions, leap forth to create a vibrant polyphony of human voices. Jan Potocki (1761-1812) used a range of literary styles - gothic, picaresque, adventure, pastoral, erotica - in his novel of stories-within-stories, which, like the Decameron and Tales from the Thousand and One Nights, provides entertainment on an epic scale.	631	1810	Alphonse van Worden, Cheik Gomelez, Émina et Zibeddé, L’ermite, Pascheco, Don Pedro Uzeda, Donna Rébecca Uzeda, Ahasuerus, Don Pedro Velasquez, Don Avadoro, Don Toledo, Busqueros, Les frères de Zoto	Andalusia (Spain)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93180.The_Manuscript_Found_in_Saragossa
