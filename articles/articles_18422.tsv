The Art Sleuth		Mary Anne Pennington	3.80	5	3	THE ART SLEUTH - Dr. Anna Lee Warren, an art professor and occasional insurance company art fraud investigator, has returned home to Gadley, North Carolina, to recuperate from a bullet wound inflicted during her most recent case of stolen art. The President of Gadley University seeks her expertise when Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcut prints appear to be missing from the university's art collection, and Anna Lee soon discovers there is more to the problem than just missing woodcut prints. Complicated by a murder and suspicious behavior in the university art gallery, Anna Lee and the insurance company investigator, Gerard Pickens, are embroiled in crime that extends beyond the university campus. THE ART SLEUTH, cleverly plotted and filled with twists and turns, is filled with fascinating characters and local color true to small Southern towns.	149	April 15th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25381750-the-art-sleuth
