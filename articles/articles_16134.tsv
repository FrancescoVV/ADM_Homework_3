Elemental	Auri #1	Emily  White	3.42	375	85	Night has fallen across the galaxy and Fire rages, uncontrolled. An army marches, killing in the name of their god. A forgotten girl sits alone in a dark cell aboard an interstellar prison ship, traveling through space, never stopping. Until one day. Now the Destructor roams and a prophecy is fulfilled. But the one thing no one expected was that their longed-for savior just might be their own undoing.	180	June 5th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11185432-elemental
