The Drunk Detective: A Dotty Davis Comedy Suspense		Mary Jean Curry	3.43	14	7	Dotty Davis belongs to that sub-genre of hard-boiled, sleazy, overweight, boozing, and otherwise disgusting private detectives increasingly offered as protagonists working for the "betterment" of humankind. Nonetheless exhibiting a modicum of charm through her heavy-handed humor, Dotty proceeds to wiggle her way out of several murder charges after answering a middle-of-the-night call from the male prostitute living downstairs from her. Soon after, Dotty, removed a dead, Catholic nun from his bed, someone rigs an explosion, sending the gigolo to the hospital. And then there's more dead bodies for Dotty to contend with, and both the police and a killer are looking for her.	260	June 5th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747029-the-drunk-detective
