Single White Vampire	Argeneau #3	Lynsay Sands	4.17	20854	823	SWM - "Lucern." Successful biographer of family, books recently categorized as "paranormal romance." Something of a recluse. Hates crowds, aggressive women. Doesn't like sunbathing, garlicky dinners or religious symbols. Likes old-fashioned values; spicy Mexican dishes; warm, nice-smelling neck; and plump red lips. Stronger than ten men and can vanish in the blink of an eye. Currently unaware he's seeking a woman to share eternity. SWF - "Kate C. Leever." Newest editor of Romance at Roundhouse Publishing. Perky, fun. Has recently discovered a legacy author just dying to be broken out. In fact, her career could take off from it. (The tall, dark, handsome writer just needs to be taken to several romance conventions and introduced to his fans...and stopped from acting so strange in public.) Dislikes "difficult, rude, obnoxious, pig-headed writers." Currently unaware she's met the man of her wildest dreams. OH, DEAR.	369	September 1st 2003	Kate Leever, Lucern Argeneau	Toronto, Ontario (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263149.Single_White_Vampire
