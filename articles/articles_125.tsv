The Name of the Rose		Umberto Eco, William Weaver	4.12	302624	8991	The year is 1327. Benedictines in a wealthy Italian abbey are suspected of heresy, and Brother William of Baskerville arrives to investigate. When his delicate mission is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William turns detective. His tools are the logic of Aristotle, the theology of Aquinas, the empirical insights of Roger Bacon—all sharpened to a glistening edge by wry humor and a ferocious curiosity. He collects evidence, deciphers secret symbols and coded manuscripts, and digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey, where “the most interesting things happen at night.”	536	1980	William of Baskerville, Adso of Melk, Abo of Fossanova, Severinus of Sankt Wendel, Malachi of Hildesheim, Berengar of Arundel, Venantius of Salvemec, Jorge of Burgos, Remigio of Varagine, Salvatore of Montferrat, Nicholas of Morimondo, Ubertino of Casale, Bernard Gui, Benno of Uppsala, Alinardo of Grottaferrata, Michael of Cesena	Italian Benedictine monastery (Italy), Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119073.The_Name_of_the_Rose
