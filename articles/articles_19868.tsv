Suck It Up	Suck It Up #1	Brian Meehl	3.66	4590	297	ARE YOU UP to your neck in bloodsucking vampire stories? Tired of those tales about dentally enhanced dark lords? Before I wrote this book I thought all vampires were night-stalking, fangpopping, bloodsucking fiends. Then I met Morning McCobb. Heâ€™s a vegan vampire who drinks a soy-blood substitute called Blood Lite. He believes staking should be a hate crime. And someday he hopes to march in a Vampire Pride Parade. He was also the first vampire to out himself and try to show people of mortality, like you and me, that vampires are just another minority with special needs. Trust meâ€”this is like no other vampire book youâ€™ll ever feed on. So, as my buddy Morning says, â€œPop the lid, and suck it up.â€	336	January 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2842796-suck-it-up
