American Royals	American Royals #1	Katharine McGee	3.87	44293	6135	What if America had a royal family? When America won the Revolutionary War, its people offered General George Washington a crown. Two and a half centuries later, the House of Washington still sits on the throne. As Princess Beatrice gets closer to becoming America's first queen regnant, the duty she has embraced her entire life suddenly feels stifling. Nobody cares about the spare except when she's breaking the rules, so Princess Samantha doesn't care much about anything, either . . . except the one boy who is distinctly off-limits to her. And then there's Samantha's twin, Prince Jefferson. If he'd been born a generation earlier, he would have stood first in line for the throne, but the new laws of succession make him third. Most of America adores their devastatingly handsome prince . . . but two very different girls are vying to capture his heart.	464	September 3rd 2019	Beatrice Georgina Fredericka Louise, Nina Gonzalez, Daphne Deighton, Samantha Martha Georgina Amphyllis, Jefferson George Alexander Augustus, Theodore Eaton, Connor Markham, Ethan Beckett		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43744300-american-royals
