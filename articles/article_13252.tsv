Rough Canvas	Nature of Desire #6	Joey W. Hill	4.29	3453	443	When his father dies, Thomas is forced to abandon a burgeoning art career in New York. As difficult as it was to give up his lifelong dream, it's nothing next to walking away from the man he loves. Marcus taught him to embrace who he is, a sexual submissive who responds to the touch of only one Master. But why would the sophisticated Marcus need some farm kid from the South? Then Marcus shows up and offers him a way to continue his art career and help his family. There's only one hitch-he asks Thomas to spend a week with him in the Berkshires. Thomas knows he should refuse. But he's never been able to say no to his Master.	316	September 12th 2007	Marcus Aurelius Stanton, Thomas Wilder	Massachusetts (United States), New York State (United States), North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5709572-rough-canvas
