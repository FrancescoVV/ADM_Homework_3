The Twelve Chairs	Ostap Bender #1	Ilya Ilf, Yevgeny Petrov, Maurice Friedberg, John H.C. Richardson	4.42	19930	442	Ostap Bender is an unemployed con artist living by his wits in postrevolutionary Soviet Russia. He joins forces with Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobyaninov, a former nobleman who has returned to his hometown to find a cache of missing jewels which were hidden in some chairs that have been appropriated by the Soviet authorities. The search for the bejeweled chairs takes these unlikely heroes from the provinces to Moscow to the wilds of Soviet Georgia and the Trans-caucasus mountains; on their quest they encounter a wide variety of characters: from opportunistic Soviet bureaucrats to aging survivors of the prerevolutionary propertied classes, each one more selfish, venal, and ineffective than the one before.	395	1928	Остап Бендер, Ипполит Матвеевич Воробьянинов, Шура Балаганов, Михаил Самуэлевич Паниковский, Адам Козлевич, Александр Иванович Корейко, Зося Синицкая	U.S.S.R.	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158516.The_Twelve_Chairs
