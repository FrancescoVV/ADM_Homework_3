Of Love and Shadows		Isabel Allende, Margaret Sayers Peden	3.97	25058	931	Beautiful and headstrong, Irene Beltrán works as a magazine journalist—a profession that belies her privileged upbringing and her engagement to an army captain. Her investigative partner is photographer Francisco Leal, the son of impoverished Spanish Marxist émigrés. Together, they form an unlikely but inseparable team—and Francisco quickly falls in love with the fierce and loyal Irene. When an assignment leads them to a young girl whom locals believe to possess miraculous powers, they uncover an unspeakable crime perpetrated by an oppressive regime. Determined to reveal the truth in a nation overrun by terror and violence, each will risk everything to find justice—and, ultimately, to embrace the passion and fervor that binds them. Profoundly moving and ultimately uplifting, Of Love and Shadows is a tale of romance, bravery, and tragedy, set against the indelible backdrop of a country ruled with an iron fist—and peopled with those who dare to challenge it.	304	1984	Irene Beltran, Francisco Leal, Beatriz Alcàntara, Evangelina Ranquileo, Pradelio Ranquileo, Digna Ranquileo, Mario (Of Love and Shadows), Rosa (Of Love and Shadows), Prof. Leal, Hilda Leal, Gustavo Morante	Chile	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16532.Of_Love_and_Shadows
