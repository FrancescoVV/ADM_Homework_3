Looking for Alaska		John Green	4.02	1118396	56395	Before. Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . . . After. Nothing is ever the same.	221	March 3rd 2005	Miles Halter, Alaska Young, Chip Martin, Takumi Hikohito, Lara Buterskaya	Alabama (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99561.Looking_for_Alaska
