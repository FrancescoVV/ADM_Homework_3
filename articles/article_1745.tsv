Gaudy Night	Lord Peter Wimsey #10	Dorothy L. Sayers	4.23	23456	1758	The great Dorothy L. Sayers is considered by many to be the premier detective novelist of the Golden Age, and her dashing sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, one of mystery fiction’s most enduring and endearing protagonists. Acclaimed author Ruth Rendell has expressed her admiration for Sayers’s work, praising her “great fertility of invention, ingenuity, and wonderful eye for detail.” The third Dorothy L. Sayers classic to feature mystery writer Harriet Vane, Gaudy Night is now back in print with an introduction by Elizabeth George, herself a crime fiction master. Gaudy Night takes Harriet and her paramour, Lord Peter, to Oxford University, Harriet’s alma mater, for a reunion, only to find themselves the targets of a nightmare of harassment and mysterious, murderous threats.	501	1935	Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey, Mervyn Bunter, Harriet Vane, Gerald, Duke of Denver, The Honorable Freddy Arbuthnot, Miss Lydgate, Gerald "Saint-George" Wimsey, Letitia Martin, Helen de Vine, Dr. Baring, Phoebe Tucker, Reggie Pomfret, Miss Burrows, Annie Wilson	Oxford, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93575.Gaudy_Night
