The Magician	The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel #2	Michael Scott	4.10	87390	2972	Alternative Cover Edition of ISBN 9780552562539 other edition found here After fleeing Ojai, Nicholas, Sophie, Josh, and Scatty emerge in Paris, the City of Lights. Home for Nicholas Flamel. Only this homecoming is anything but sweet. Perenelle is still locked up back in Alcatraz and Paris is teeming with enemies. Niccolo Machiavelli, immortal author and celebrated art collector, is working for Dee. He’s after them, and time is running out for Nicholas and Perenelle. For every day spent without the Book of Abraham the Mage, they age one year-their magic becoming weaker and their bodies more frail. For Flamel, the Prophecy is becoming more and more clear. It’s time for Sophie to learn the second elemental magic: Fire Magic. And there’s only one man who can teach it to her: Flamel’s old student, the Comte de Saint-Germain-alchemist, magician, and rock star. Josh and Sophie Newman are the world’s only hope-if they don’t turn on each other first.	464	June 24th 2008	Nicholas Flamel, Perenelle Flamel, Josh Newman, Sophie Newman, Sgàthach, the Warrior Maid, Dr. John Dee		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2402971.The_Magician
