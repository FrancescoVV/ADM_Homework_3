Kiss me, Chloe	Kiss Me #1	Linda George	3.32	218	20	Chloe Lewellyn has set aside her hopes and dreams long enough. All she wants now is to escape from Houston, and from Greg, whose career will always come first. She wants a new life, and, in time, a new love who will put her first in his life and allow her to be the person she wants to be. Kyle Stanton spies her sitting alone in a crowded restaurant in Albuquerque. Somehow, he knows from the moment he sees her sad expression that this woman, whose heart has been shattered, holds the key to the happiness that has eluded him. How can he convince her to give love another chance? The answer lies in the Rocky Mountains. . . . Linda George has published more than 70 books, fiction and non-fiction, for children, teens, and adults. Her blog and information about her other books can be found on her website. www.LindaGeorge.net	191	April 10th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17833808-kiss-me-chloe
