The Ugly Duckling	Mine f√∏rste eventyr	Hans Christian Andersen, Jerry Pinkney	4.10	38759	1448	For over one hundred years The Ugly Duckling has been a childhood favorite, and Jerry Pinkney's spectacular new adaptation brings it triumphantly to new generations of readers. With keen emotion and fresh vision, the acclaimed artist captures the essence of the tale's timeless appeal: The journey of the awkward little bird -- marching bravely through hecklers, hunters, and cruel seasons -- is an unforgettable survival story; this blooming into a graceful swan is a reminder of the patience often necessary to discover true happiness. Splendid watercolors set in the lush countryside bring drama to life.	40	1843			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122967.The_Ugly_Duckling
