Regenesis	Cyteen #4	C.J. Cherryh	4.01	1240	126	The direct sequel to the Hugo Award- winning novel "Cyteen", "Regenesis" continues the story of Ariane Emory PR, the genetic clone of one of the greatest scientists humanity has ever produced, and of her search for the murderer of her progenitor -- the original Ariane Emory. Murder, politics, deception, and genetic and psychological manipulation combine against a backdrop of interstellar human societies at odds to create a mesmerizing and major work in "Regenesis." Who did kill the original Ariane Emory? And can her personal replicate avoid the same fate? Those questions have remained unanswered for two decades since the publication of "Cyteen." Now, in "Regenesis", those questions will finally be answered.	585	2009	Justin Warrick, Grant ALX, Ariane Emory II		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3689197-regenesis
