The MacKade Brothers: Rafe and Jared	The MacKade Brothers #1-2	Nora Roberts	4.17	11039	211	Ten years later and the bad boy of the bunch had returned home. Appealing as ever, no even lovely Regan Joners, the town's reserved antiques dealer, was immune to Rafe MacKade. Regan claimed her plans didn't include relationships with rebels, but her reaction to The Return of Rafe MacKade - and his sizzling kisses - said something quite different. Attorney Jared MacKade had his pick of women. His dealings with Savannah Morningstar were strictly business, but thoughts of the outragious, direct and sinfully sexy woman kept him coming back for more. With Savannah's incendiary attitude, plus The Pride of Jared MacKade something - good or bad - was bound to erupt.	425	1995	Regan Jones, Rafe MacKade, Savannah Morningstar, Jared MacKade	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59818.The_MacKade_Brothers
