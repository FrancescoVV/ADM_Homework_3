Abandonment to Divine Providence: The Classic Text with a Spiritual Commentary		Jean-Pierre de Caussade, Dennis J. Billy	4.12	2803	149	Jean-Pierre de Caussade, a French Jesuit spiritual director and writer born in the late seventeenth century, is best known for his belief in the sacredness of the present moment, or the "eternal now." His masterpiece, "Abandonment to Divine Providence," has been celebrated by spiritual writers as diverse as Richard Foster and Alan Watts for its ability to invoke the mystery of eternity in the now--a tenet of spirituality that resonates across faith traditions. Accompanied by the probing, expert commentary of Dennis Billy, C.Ss.R., this exemplary edition of de Caussade's "Abandonment" offers newcomers to mysticism and spiritual direction a clear, compelling path to entering into God's presence.	205	1861			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1603615.Abandonment_to_Divine_Providence
