Blindness	Blindness #1	José Saramago	4.13	202135	16447	From Nobel Prize–winning author José Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss A city is hit by an epidemic of "white blindness" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations, and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As Blindness reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.	349	1995	The doctor (Blindness), The doctor's wife, The girl with the dark glasses, The first blind man, The first blind man's wife, The boy with the squint, The old man with the black eye patch, The car thief		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40495148-blindness
