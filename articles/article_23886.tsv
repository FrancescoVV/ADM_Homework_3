Watch Over Me	Mercenary/Goddard Project #9	Lucy Monroe	3.93	491	28	Super-spy Mykola Chernichenko comes from a family of geniuses, and though he's no idiot himself, he'd rather be where the action is than analyze it to death. That's why his vacation has just been cut short by a call to get two of his siblings out of some serious trouble--while protecting a nerdy scientist whose latest project could change the world...and get her killed. The guy who'd rather act than think guarding an egghead in a lab coat? Myk would appreciate the irony more if he weren't so busy trying to figure out how, exactly, to get under said lab coat. Because Lana Ericson just happens to be the hottest thing working the scientific method since, well, ever. Myk has a feeling Lana's laser-like focus would translate to something equally intense in the bedroom. And if she's as curious about him, Myk might just be willing to donate his body to science--each and every night...	312	December 2008	Mykola Chernichenko, Lana Ericson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6049224-watch-over-me
