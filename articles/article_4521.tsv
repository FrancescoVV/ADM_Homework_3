Elephant Man		Christine Sparks	3.96	1588	84	John Merrick had lived for more than twenty years imprisoned in a body that condemned him to a miserable life in the workhouse and to humiliation as a circus sideshow freak. But beneath that tragic exterior, within that enormous and deformed head, thrived the soul of a poet, the heart of a dreamer, the longings of a man. Based on the extraordinary motion picture that captured the heart of America.	288	January 1st 1980	John Merrick		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156378.Elephant_Man
