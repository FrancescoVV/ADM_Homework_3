Dirty Rowdy Thing	Wild Seasons #2	Christina Lauren	4.24	23167	1908	From the New York Times best-selling author of Beautiful Bastard, Beautiful Stranger, and Beautiful Player, Book Two of the brand-new Wild Seasons series that started with Sweet Filthy Boy - a story of friends, love, and lust. Despite their rowdy hookups, Harlow and Finn don't even like each other... which would explain why their marriage lasted only 12 hours. He needs to be in charge and takes whatever he wants. She lives by the Want-something-done? Do-it-yourself mantra. Maybe she's too similar to the rugged fisherman - or just what he needs.	352	November 4th 2014	Harlow Vega, Finn Roberts	San Diego, California (United States), Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21411902-dirty-rowdy-thing
