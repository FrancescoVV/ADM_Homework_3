The Talents of Bet		Steven Hammond	5.00	2	1	Sold into servitude at the age of fourteen, the orphaned Bet endures constant abuse from the mistress of a backwater farm. Despite her heinous treatment, she keeps her spirits high, for she has a secretâ€”she can talk with animals. With the aid of her friend Pooch-kin, they make adventures of the constant chores. While gathering wood, Bet finds a glimmering crystal in the sludge of a muddy creek. This chance discovery sets her on a course of real adventure; where she finds speaking with animals is only one of her many Talents.	276	October 6th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36370936-the-talents-of-bet
