Lair	Rats #2	James Herbert	3.93	6265	243	The mutant white rat had grown and mated, creating offspring in its own image. They dominated the others, the dark-furred ones, who foraged for food and brought it back to the lair. Now the dark rats were restless, and the white slug-like thing that ruled them remembered the taste of human flesh.	272	1979			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397872.Lair
