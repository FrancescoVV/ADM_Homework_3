Norwegian Wood	ノルウェイの森	Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin	4.03	350164	21090	Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before. Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable. As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman. A magnificent blending of the music, the mood, and the ethos that was the sixties with the story of one college student's romantic coming of age, Norwegian Wood brilliantly recaptures a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.	296	September 4th 1987	Toru Watanabe, Naoko, Midori Kobayashi, Reiko Ishida, Nagasawa	Tokyo (Japan), Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood
