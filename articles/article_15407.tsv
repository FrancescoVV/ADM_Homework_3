Blood Games	Chicagoland Vampires #10	Chloe Neill	4.23	10927	649	While Merit didn’t choose to become a vampire or Sentinel of Cadogan House, she vowed to fight for her House and its Master, and she’s managed to forge strong alliances with powerful supernaturals across Chicago. But even though Merit has had wild adventures, this may be her deadliest yet... A killer is stalking Chicago, preying on humans and leaving his victims with magical souvenirs. The CPD hasn’t been able to track the assailant, and as the body count rises, the city is running out of options. Vampires and humans aren’t on great terms, but murder makes for strange bedfellows. Can Merit find the killer before she becomes a target?	350	August 5th 2014	Caroline "Merit" Merit, Ethan Sullivan, Mallory Carmichael, Catcher Bell, Jeff Christopher		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12958049-blood-games
