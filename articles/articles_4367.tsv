Still Life	Chief Inspector Armand Gamache #1	Louise Penny	3.88	153005	13032	As the early morning mist clears on Thanksgiving Sunday, the homes of Three Pines come to life - all except one… To locals, the village is a safe haven. So they are bewildered when a well-loved member of the community is found lying dead in the maple woods. Surely it was an accident - a hunter's arrow gone astray. Who could want Jane Neal dead? In a long and distinguished career with the Sûreté du Quebec, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache has learned to look for snakes in Eden. Gamache knows something dark is lurking behind the white picket fences, and if he watches closely enough, Three Pines will begin to give up its secrets…	293	January 1st 2005	Peter Morrow, Jane Neal, Jean Guy Beauvoir, Clara Morrow, Philippe Croft, Matthew Croft, Suzanne Belanger-Croft, Gabriel Dubeau, Olivier Brulé, Ruth Zardo, Ben Hadley, Myrna Landers, Yvette Nichol, Dr. Sharon Harris, Yolande Fontaine, Andre Malenfant, Bernard Malenfant, Isabelle Lacoste, Michel Brebeuf, Chief Inspector Gamache, Norman Stickley	Three Pines, Quebec (Canada), Eastern Townships, Quebec (Canada), Montréal	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338691.Still_Life
