The Fortress of Solitude		Jonathan Lethem	3.86	20999	1472	From the prize-winning author of Motherless Brooklyn , a daring, riotous, sweeping novel that spins the tale of two friends and their adventures in late 20th-century America. This is the story of two boys, Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude. They live in Brooklyn and are friends and neighbours; but since Dylan is white and Mingus is black, their friendship is not simple. This is the story of 1970s America, a time when the simplest decisions - what music you listen to, whether to speak to the kid in the seat next to you, whether to give up your lunch money - are laden with potential political, social and racial disaster. This is also the story of 1990s America, when nobody cared anymore. This is the story of what would happen if two teenaged boys obsessed with comic book heroes actually had superpowers: they would screw up their lives.	528	September 16th 2003	Dylan Ebdus, Mingus Rude	Brooklyn, New York City, New York (United States), Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9799.The_Fortress_of_Solitude
