There are two Wakefield twins in our marching band, but only one drum. Which twin should play it? Me, of course. But my twin sister, Elizabeth, got picked instead! I want to play that drum more than anything. And I won't stop making noise until I do!	96	February 9th 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/407816.Little_Drummer_Girls
