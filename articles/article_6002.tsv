The Bat (The Red Grouse Tales) - A coming of age story involving a search after truth, doubt and a bat!	The Red Grouse Tales	Leslie   Garland	4.36	395	23	What is true? What is truth? An adult, speculative, spiritual and philosophical coming of age story. An old and now sceptical Thomas looks back on the events of his last term at school when his class returned to a new beautiful class teacher, a donation of stuffed animals and birds by an eccentric benefactor and the increasingly strange events which followed. Zoological specimens appeared to be not quite as dead as they looked. A bell-jar which had contained a stuffed bat shattered during an exorcism, after which what had been strange events turned to being sinister and frightening. As a then naive young Thomas searched for the truth, he found himself, questioning ‘good and evil’, realising that his task is not as simple and straightforward as he would have wished and in so doing loosing his innocence and having to accept that belief may have as much to do with truth as do facts. A tale for those who like to think on what they are reading. (Warning to sensitive readers; the story is an adult one and so does contain references to sex)	145	April 29th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53135032-the-bat
