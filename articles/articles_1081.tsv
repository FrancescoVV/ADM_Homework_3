The Alchemyst	The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel #1	Michael Scott	3.84	142429	8436	Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on 28 September 1330. Nearly seven hundred years later, he is acknowledged as the greatest Alchemyst of his day. It is said that he discovered the secret of eternal life. The records show that he died in 1418. But his tomb is empty and Nicholas Flamel lives. The secret of eternal life is hidden within the book he protects—the Book of Abraham the Mage. It's the most powerful book that has ever existed. In the wrong hands, it will destroy the world. And that's exactly what Dr. John Dee plans to do when he steals it. Humankind won't know what's happening until it's too late. And if the prophecy is right, Sophie and Josh Newman are the only ones with the power to save the world as we know it. Sometimes legends are true. And Sophie and Josh Newman are about to find themselves in the middle of the greatest legend of all time.	390	May 22nd 2007	Nicholas Flamel, Perenelle Flamel, Josh Newman, Sophie Newman, Sgàthach, the Warrior Maid, Dr. John Dee	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17402605-the-alchemyst
