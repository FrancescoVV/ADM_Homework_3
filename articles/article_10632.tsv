Vanity Fierce	The Indignities #prequel	Graeme Aitken	3.73	101	15	Stephen Spear is blond, blue-eyed and blessed with countless talents. In matters of the heart, he assumed it would be no different. It is quite a shock when he falls in love for the first time, to find his desire is unrequited. But he will have his way â€” even if he has to cheat, lie and plot.	408	December 3rd 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1413068.Vanity_Fierce
