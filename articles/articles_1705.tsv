A Hunger Like No Other	Immortals After Dark #1	Kresley Cole	4.17	67643	3401	In New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author Kresley Cole’s sizzling series, a fierce werewolf and a bewitching vampire become unlikely soul mates whose passion will test the boundaries of life and death. After enduring years of torture from the vampire horde, Lachlain MacRieve, leader of the Lykae Clan, is enraged to find the predestined mate he’s waited millennia for is a vampire. Or partly one. Emmaline Troy is a small, ethereal half Valkyrie/half vampire, who somehow begins to soothe the fury burning within him. Sheltered Emmaline finally sets out to uncover the truth about her deceased parents—until a powerful Lykae claims her as his mate and forces her back to his ancestral Scottish castle. There, her fear of the Lykae—and their notorious dark desires—ebbs as he begins a slow, wicked seduction to sate her own dark cravings. Yet when an ancient evil from her past resurfaces, will their desire deepen into a love that can bring a proud warrior to his knees and turn a gentle beauty into the fighter she was born to be?	360	March 28th 2006	Lachlain MacRieve, Emmaline Troy, Myst, the Coveted, Phenïx "Nïx", The Ever-Knowing, King Kristoff, Nikolai Wroth	Paris (France), New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Scottish Highlands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14384.A_Hunger_Like_No_Other
