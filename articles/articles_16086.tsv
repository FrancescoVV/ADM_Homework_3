Seduction in Death	In Death #13	J.D. Robb	4.33	25311	778	Dante had been courting his victim in cyberspace for weeks before meeting her in person. A few sips of wine and a few hours later, she was dead. The murder weapon: a rare, usually undetectable date-rape drug with a street value of a quarter million dollars. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is playing and replaying the clues in her mind. The candlelight, the music, the rose petals strewn across the bed - a seduction meant for his benefit, not hers. He hadn't intended to kill her. But now that he has, he is left with only two choices: to either hole up in fear and guilt or start hunting again. . .	354	September 1st 2001	Eve Dallas, Roarke, Nyle Sumner, Ezra Trent, Delia Peabody, Ryan Feeney, Charlotte Mira, Ian McNab, Louise Dimatto, Charles Monroe	United States of America, New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238127.Seduction_in_Death
