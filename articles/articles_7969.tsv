The Fade		Chris Wooding	3.88	646	68	A subterranean world of vast caverns, underground seas, crystalline forests. A civilisation born of darkness, in darkness, protected by shadows. A city of merchants, whose eyes have turned upward to the surface, where the lethal light of day beats down on their world. A conspiracy so vast that it will swallow them all . . . A stunningly original fantasy from a multi-award winning author. With a beautiful baroque world, sharp characterisation and Chris Wooding's trademark insight into the fantasy genre, the dawning of Halflight is an event more than worth waiting for.	312	January 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/951454.The_Fade
