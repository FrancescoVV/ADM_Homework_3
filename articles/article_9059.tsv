The Magic Thief	Magic Thief #1	Sarah Prineas, Antonio Javier Caparo	3.96	17331	1214	In a city that runs on a dwindling supply of magic, a young boy is drawn into a life of wizardry and adventure. Conn should have dropped dead the day he picked Nevery's pocket and touched the wizard's locus magicalicus, a stone used to focus magic and work spells. But for some reason he did not. Nevery finds that interesting, and he takes Conn as his apprentice on the provision that the boy find a locus stone of his own. But Conn has little time to search for his stone between wizard lessons and helping Nevery discover who or what is stealing the city of Wellmet's magic.	419	June 3rd 2008	Connwaer (Conn), Nevery Flinglas, Benet, Rowan Forestal		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1809175.The_Magic_Thief
