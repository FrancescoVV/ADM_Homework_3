Cinema of Shadows	Harmony, Indiana #2	Michael  West	3.70	297	61	Welcome to the Woodfield Movie Palace. The night the Titanic sank, it opened for business...and its builder died in his chair. In the 1950s, there was a fire; a balcony full of people burned to death. And years later, when it became the scene of one of Harmony, Indiana's most notorious murders, it closed for good. Abandoned, sealed, locked up tight...until now. Tonight, Professor Geoffrey Burke and his Parapsychology students have come to the Woodfield in search of evidence, hoping to find irrefutable proof of a haunting. Instead, they will discover that, in this theater, the terrors are not confined to the screen.	281	August 9th 2011	Robby Miller, Dr. Tyler Bachman, Kim Saunders, Shelly Wells, Delbert King, Tashima Ishmail, Kevin Heiliger, Joss Giler, Geoffrey Burke, Detective Roy Perry	Harmony, Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12292002-cinema-of-shadows
