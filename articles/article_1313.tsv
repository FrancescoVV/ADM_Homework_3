Blood Bound	Mercy Thompson #2	Patricia Briggs	4.31	112094	4036	Under the rule of science, there are no witch burnings allowed, no water trials or public lynchings. In return, the average law-abiding, solid citizen has little to worry about from the things that go bump in the night. Sometimes I wish I was an average citizen... Mechanic Mercy Thompson has friends in low places-and in dark ones. And now she owes one of them a favor. Since she can shapeshift at will, she agrees to act as some extra muscle when her vampire friend Stefan goes to deliver a message to another of his kind. But this new vampire is hardly ordinary-and neither is the demon inside of him.	292	January 30th 2007	Adam Hauptman, Samuel Cornick, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Charles Cornick, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Honey Jorgenson, Wulfe, Kyle Brooks, Stefan Uccello, Marsilia, Uncle Mike, Gabriel Sandoval, Tony Montenegro, Bran "The Marrok" Cornick, Ben Shaw, Andre (The Courtier)	United States of America, Washington (state) (United States), Tri-Cities, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/285205.Blood_Bound
