The Conquest of Happiness		Bertrand Russell	4.02	10041	805	The Conquest of Happiness is Bertrand Russell's recipe for good living. First published in 1930, it pre-dates the current obsession with self-help by decades. Leading the reader step by step through the causes of unhappiness and the personal choices, compromises and sacrifices that (may) lead to the final, affirmative conclusion of 'The Happy Man', this is popular philosophy, or even self-help, as it should be written.	183	1930			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51783.The_Conquest_of_Happiness
