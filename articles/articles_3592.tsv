Glory in Death	In Death #2	J.D. Robb	4.26	52647	2455	It is 2058, New York City. In a world where technology can reveal the darkest of secrets, there's only one place to hide a crime of passion-in the heart. Even in the mid-twenty-first century, during a time when genetic testing usually weeds out any violent hereditary traits before they can take over, murder still happens. The first victim is found lying on a sidewalk in the rain. The second is murdered in her own apartment building. Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas has no problem finding connections between the two crimes. Both victims were beautiful and highly successful women. Their glamorous lives and loves were the talk of the city. And their intimate relations with men of great power and wealth provide Eve with a long list of suspects -- including her own lover, Roarke.	296	December 1st 1995	Eve Dallas, Roarke, Delia Peabody, Ryan Feeney, Charlotte Mira, Commander Jack Whitney, Mavis Freestone, Nadine Furst, Lawrence Charles Summerset, Chief Harrison Tibble, Anna Whitney	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/268601.Glory_in_Death
