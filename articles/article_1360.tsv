Angels' Blood	Guild Hunter #1	Nalini Singh	4.09	76958	4786	USA Today bestselling author Nalini Singh introduces a world of beauty and bloodlust, where angels hold sway over vampires… Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux knows she’s the best—but she doesn’t know if she’s good enough for this job. Hired by the dangerously beautiful Archangel Raphael, a being so lethal that no mortal wants his attention, only one thing is clear—failure is not an option…even if the task is impossible. Because this time, it’s not a wayward vamp she has to track. It’s an archangel gone bad. The job will put Elena in the midst of a killing spree like no other…and pull her to the razor’s edge of passion.
