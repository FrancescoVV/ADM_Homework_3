Then Mary knows that she must defy her family and her king and take fate into her own hands. A rich and compelling novel of love, sex, ambition, and intrigue, The Other Boleyn Girl introduces a woman of extraordinary determination and desire who lived at the heart of the most exciting and glamourous court in Europe and survived by following her heart.	661	April 21st 2001	Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour, Mary Boleyn, Mary Tudor, Queen of France, Henry VIII of England, Elizabeth I of England, Mary I of England	Westminster Palace, London, England (United Kingdom), England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37470.The_Other_Boleyn_Girl
