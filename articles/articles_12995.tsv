Dorothy Must Die: Stories	Dorothy Must Die #0.1-0.3	Danielle  Paige	3.86	3537	348	Long before Amy Gumm got swept away from a Kansas trailer park…Dorothy Gale received a package on the night of her 16th birthday: a pair of red high-heeled shoes. Dear Dorothy, the note read. I thought about silver to match the ones you lost, but in the end I decided that red was more your color. I think you know what to do with them. And with a knock of her heels, Dorothy returned to the magical land that made her a star—and Oz would never be the same again. This bind-up of three prequel novellas to the New York Times bestselling Dorothy Must Die series follows Dorothy Gale as she transforms from good girl to Wicked Witch. Kiss the land where troubles melt like lemon drops goodbye. Here there’s danger around every corner, and magical shoes won’t be able to save you.	392	March 3rd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23527476-dorothy-must-die
