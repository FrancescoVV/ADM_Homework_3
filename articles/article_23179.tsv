The Summer of Dead Birds		Ali Liebegott	4.32	206	31	In a chronicle of mourning and survival, Ali Liebegott wallows in loneliness and overassigns meaning to everyday circumstance, clinging to an aging dog and obsessing over dead birds. But these unpretentious vignettes are laced with compassion, as she learns to balance the sting of death with the tender strangeness of life.	104	March 12th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40236569-the-summer-of-dead-birds
