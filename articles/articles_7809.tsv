In a brand-new world, Co:per:nica, which runs parallel to that of Crescent Lane, firebirds roam the ancient librarium, a museum for books. But when 12-year-old David and Rosanna accidentally injure one of the firebirds, they are suddenly thrust into a remarkable adventure. The evil Ix have taken over one of the firebirds, turning it to the side of darkness, but the birds have a secret: They know about the existence of dragons. And from across the universe, one may come to their aid....	576	January 1st 2011	David Merriman, Eliza Merriman, Harlan Merriman, Thorren Str√∏mberg, Bernard Brotherton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7842739-fire-world
