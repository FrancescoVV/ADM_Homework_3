The Winter's Tale		William Shakespeare, Susan Snyder, Deborah T. Curren-Aquino	3.71	25669	1264	The New Cambridge Shakespeare appeals to students worldwide for its up-to-date scholarship and emphasis on performance. The series features line-by-line commentaries and textual notes on the plays and poems and an extensive introduction. The Winter's Tale is one of Shakespeare's most varied, theatrically self-conscious, and emotionally wide-ranging plays. Much of the play's copiousness inheres in its generic intermingling of tragedy, comedy, romance, pastoral, and the history play. In addition to dates and sources, the introduction attends to iterative patterns, the nature and cause of Leontes' jealousy, the staging and meaning of the bear episode, and the thematic and structural implications of the figure of Time. Special attention is paid to the ending and its tempered happiness. Performance history is integrated throughout the introduction and commentary. Appendices include the theatrical practice of doubling.	279	1623	Leontes of Sicilia, Paulina, Camillo, Autolycus, Polixenes of Bohemia, Hermione of Sicilia, Florizel of Bohemia, Clown, Perdita of Sicilia, Shepherd, reputed father to Perdita, Steward, Gentleman, Antigonus, Time, Dion, Cleomenes, Mopsa, Mamilius, Archidamus, Emilia, Officer, Dorcas (The Mysterious Affair at Styles), Rogero, Gaoler, Mariner	Sicily (Italy), Bohemia (Czech Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44133.The_Winter_s_Tale
