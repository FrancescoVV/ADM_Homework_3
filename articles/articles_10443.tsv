The Devil of Nanking		Mo Hayder	3.92	7981	952	Like the thrillers of Thomas Harris and Philip Kerr, Mo Hayder's riveting new novel animates the dark corners of modern history. The solitary Englishwoman Grey comes to Japan looking for a rare piece of footage that is said to document a particularly monstrous episode of the 1937 Nanking Massacre. Her quest will take her to a reclusive scholar and a wheelchair-bound gangster who clings to life with the aid of a mysterious elixir, and to a handsome American whose interest in Grey may be more sinister than romantic. The result is a work of spine-chilling suspense, masterful historical detail, and otherworldly beauty.	480	2004	Shi Chongming, Grey	Tokyo (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366787.The_Devil_of_Nanking
