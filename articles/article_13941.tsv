Revealed	Fountain Creek Chronicles #2	Tamera Alexander	4.26	3513	186	Words, once spoken, can mend a broken life…or cripple it. But words left unspoken can haunt the soul, inflicting a far deeper wound. Annabelle Grayson has been given a second chance at life, but she can't claim it with the cloud of her past hanging over her in Willow Springs. After her husband dies, she advertises for a trail guide to accompany her to land waiting for her in Idaho—and a most unlikely candidate applies for the job. Matthew Taylor is a man on the run, with consequences of past mistakes pursuing him at every turn. Meeting Annabelle Grayson the first time was unpleasant enough, but when she crosses his path again, her presence in his life—and what she reveals—is devastating. If given a single wish, Matthew would turn back time and right a grievous wrong. If given a second wish, he would make Annabelle Grayson pay.	332	October 2006	Larson Jennings, Kathryn Jennings, Jack Brennan, Annabelle Grayson McCutchens, Matthew Taylor	Colorado Territory (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/593038.Revealed
