At the Mountains of Madness		H.P. Lovecraft, China Mi√©ville, S.T. Joshi	3.87	35265	2703	Long acknowledged as a master of nightmarish vision, H.P. Lovecraft established the genuineness and dignity of his own pioneering fiction in 1931 with his quintessential work of supernatural horror, At the Mountains of Madness . The deliberately told and increasingly chilling recollection of an Antarctic expedition's uncanny discoveries --and their encounter with an untold menace in the ruins of a lost civilization--is a milestone of macabre literature.	138	January 1st 1936		Antarctica, Australia, Egypt, Arabia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32767.At_the_Mountains_of_Madness
