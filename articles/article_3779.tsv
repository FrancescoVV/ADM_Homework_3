The Harlequin	Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #15	Laurell K. Hamilton	3.92	42578	958	Anita Blake is about to face the challenge of her life. Into her world-a world already overflowing with power-have come creatures so feared that powerful, centuries-old vampires refuse to mention their names. It is forbidden to speak of The Harlequin unless you've been contacted. And to be contacted by The Harlequin is to be under sentence of death. Long-time rivals for Anita's affections, Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of the City, and Richard, alpha-werewolf, will need to become allies. Shapeshifters Nathaniel and Micah will have to step up their support. And then there's Edward. In this situation, Anita knows that she needs to call the one man who has always been there for her...	422	2007	Anita Blake, Jean-Claude (Anita Blake series), Richard Zeeman, Edward "Ted" Forrester, Malcolm (Anita Blake series), Asher (Anita Blake series), Jason Schuyler, Nathaniel Graison, Damian (Anita Blake series), Micah Callahan, Marmee Noir, Belle Morte, Olaf Gundersson, Wicked Truth	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30225.The_Harlequin
