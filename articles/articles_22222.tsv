The Buntline Special	Weird West Tales #1	Mike Resnick	3.46	1282	196	Welcome to a West like you've never seen before, where electric lights shine down on the streets of Tombstone, while horseless stagecoaches carry passengers to and fro, and where death is no obstacle to The Thing That Was Once Johnny Ringo. Think you know the story of the O.K. Corral? Think again, as five-time Hugo winner Mike Resnick takes on his first steampunk western tale, and the West will never be the same.	320	January 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8253037-the-buntline-special
