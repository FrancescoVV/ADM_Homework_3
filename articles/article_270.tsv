Living with her aunt, uncle, and cousins in Portland, Maine, Lena Haloway is very much looking forward to being cured and living a safe, predictable life. She watched love destroy her mother and isn't about to make the same mistake. But with ninety-five days left until her treatment, Lena meets enigmatic Alex, a boy from the "Wilds" who lives under the government's radar. What will happen if they do the unthinkable and fall in love?	441	January 1st 2011	Hana Tate, Magdalena "Lena" Ella Haloway-Tiddle, Alex Sheathes, Carol Tiddle, Grace Tiddle	Portland, Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11614718-delirium
