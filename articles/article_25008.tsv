In a Heartbeat		Loretta Ellsworth	4.09	3773	435	For fans of Gabrielle Zevin and Lurlene McDaniel, In a Heartbeat explores the ties of family and the weight of regret when a mistake costs Eagan her life during a figure-skating competition. Left in the afterlife, reflecting on what she could have done differently, Eagan's still-beating heart is given to Amelia who has been waiting patiently for a transplant. When their thought, feelings, and dreams begin to mysteriously overlap, Amelia knows she must search for Eagan's family and find a way to give them all the closure they need move on. Praise for In a Heartbeat: "[A] dramatic story of loss and second chances. . . a highly satisfying read." -Booklist "Readers will likely come away teary-eyed and inspired." -Publishers Weekly	217	February 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6696420-in-a-heartbeat
