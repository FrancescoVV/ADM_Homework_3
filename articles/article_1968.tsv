The Immortals of Meluha	Shiva Trilogy #1	Amish Tripathi	4.09	101919	5693	1900 BC. In what modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived. This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills! The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend: When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge. Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero? And does he want to be that hero at all? Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva lead the Suryavanshi vengeance and destroy evil?	436	January 1st 2010	Shiva, Sati, Nandi, Veerbhadra, BÅ—ahaspati, Daksha, Kanakhla, Parvateshvar, Ayurvati, Suryavanshis, Chandravanshis, Naga	Meluha	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7913305-the-immortals-of-meluha
