This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen		Tadeusz Borowski, Barbara Vedder, Jan Kott, Michael Kandel	4.17	6064	408	Tadeusz Borowski's concentration camp stories were based on his own experiences surviving Auschwitz and Dachau. In spare, brutal prose he describes a world where the will to survive overrides compassion and prisoners eat, work and sleep a few yards from where others are murdered; where the difference between human beings is reduced to a second bowl of soup, an extra blanket or the luxury of a pair of shoes with thick soles, and where the line between normality and abnormality completely vanishes. Published in Poland after the Second World War, these stories constitute a masterwork of world literature.	180	1947		Auschwitz (Poland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228244.This_Way_for_the_Gas_Ladies_and_Gentlemen
