Plantation	Lowcountry Tales #2	Dorothea Benton Frank	4.18	11150	503	Pat Conroy called Dorothea Benton Frank’s debut, Sullivan’s Island , “hilarious and wise,” while Anne Rivers Siddons declared that it “roars with life.” Now Frank evokes a lush plantation in the heart of modern-day South Carolina—where family ties and hidden truths run as deep and dark as the mighty Edisto River… Caroline Wimbley Levine always swore she’d never go home again. But now, at her brother’s behest, she has returned to South Carolina to see about Mother—only to find that the years have not changed the Queen of Tall Pines Plantation. Miss Lavinia is as maddeningly eccentric as ever—and absolutely will not suffer the questionable advice of her children. This does not surprise Caroline. Nor does the fact that Tall Pines is still brimming with scandals and secrets, betrayals and lies. But she soon discovers that something is different this time around. It lies somewhere in the distance between her and her mother—and in her understanding of what it means to come home…	449	July 1st 2001	Susan Hayes, Caroline Wimbley Levine, Simon Rifkin	Tall Plains, South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65397.Plantation
