Gods in Oslo		John Plaski	4.00	7	4	People are dying in Europe. They were not ordinary people, though. They had secret lives and unbelievable abilities. The murderers had stronger, stranger powers. All of them, attackers and victims, belong to Olympus: an organization built with myths, heroes, and legends. Three agents stole a list of names and disappeared. Who are they? Thereâ€™s FoxGemini, a faceless monster; HiberniaRex, an altered assassin; and PsycheSpecter, an icy truth-seeker. These three are killing their comrades. Now, after a full year of terror, the traitors have entered Oslo. Three agents are their next targets: Marc, a scarred veteran; Claire, a fiery warrior; and Kaitlin, a future-seeing, distrusting shadow. Battles will rage and secrets well up from the anonymous streets of Oslo to the deepest, darkest memories.	488	July 25th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26490770-gods-in-oslo
