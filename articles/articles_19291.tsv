The Legend of the 10 Elemental Masters		Nick  Smith	3.96	50	10	What begins as an investigation into the cause of a series of unusual and unexplained events turns into a battle to save the Earth from elemental destruction. A mysterious, powerful, and persistent evil force seeks the masters of the elements that control and balance each element from an Earth entirely of that element. Earth's only hope is a powerful, spell-casting alien who has the dream of making three ordinary humans become like him. What hideous act does the evil force have planned? Immerse yourself into a deep, twisting plot that feels like you're playing a role playing game instead of reading. The unique script-like format reads like a classic role playing game. The in-depth, extreme character statistics and numbers popping out of objects further immerse you into the play.	274	2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8593843-the-legend-of-the-10-elemental-masters
