With The Testaments , the wait is over. Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead. In this brilliant sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades. "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood	422	September 10th 2019	Aunt Lydia, Agnes Jemima, Daisy	Republic of Gilead, Toronto, Ontario (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42975172-the-testaments
