Diary of a Superfluous Man		Ivan Turgenev, David A. Patterson	3.84	2002	148	When Turgenev published Diary of a Superfluous Man in 1850, he created one of the first literary portraits of the alienated man. Turgenev once said that there was a great deal of himself in the unsuccessful lovers who appear in his fiction. This failure, along with painful self-consciousness, is a central fact for the ailing Chulkaturin in this melancholy tale. As he reflects on his life, he tells the story of Liza, whom he loved, and a prince, whom she loved instead, and the curious turns all their lives took.	80	1850			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/971670.Diary_of_a_Superfluous_Man
