True Blood Collection	Sookie Stackhouse #1-9, & A Touch of Dead	Charlaine Harris	4.44	6731	230	Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in a little bar in Bon Temps, a small town deep in Louisiana. She's funny and pretty and well-mannered, but she doesn't have that many close friends - mind you, that's not so surprising when you consider how few people can appreciate her abilities as a mind-reader. It's not a quality that has the guys beating down her door - well, unless they're vampires or werewolves or the like... but they're not just supernatural freaks, some of them are friends, even family... The box contains: Dead Until Dark, Living Dead in Dallas, Club Dead, Dead to the World, Dead as a Doornail, Definitely Dead, All Together Dead, From Dead to Worse, Dead and Gone, A Touch of Dead.	800	October 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9077707-true-blood-collection
