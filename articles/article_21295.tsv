Love By Chance		Holly Willow	5.00	1	0	Having just ended a long-term relationship with a man who was perfect on paper but not right for her, Emily isn't eager to start a new one. She's on vacation on a Greek island. All she wants to do is relax and have some fun. And she wouldn't mind having a summer fling with the gorgeous Englishman she bumps into. The only problem is that he wants more than a vacation romance. Now Emily has to decide if she's ready to take a chance on love again.	253	October 15th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43181331-love-by-chance
