The Infinite Within		Michael Drakich	4.31	13	11	Going into outer space calls to Astronaut Brooke Jones like the sirens of old, and when the chance to be part of the first manned mission to Mars arises, she is ecstatic. But little does she know the fate that awaits her on the surface of the red planet or the results of her encounter when she gets back to Earth.	278	July 24th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18242339-the-infinite-within
