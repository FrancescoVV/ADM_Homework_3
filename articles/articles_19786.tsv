Diary of a Provincial Lady	The Provincial Lady #1	E.M. Delafield, Arthur Watts	3.93	4419	612	When Diary of a Provincial Lady was first published in 1930, critics on both sides of the Atlantic greeted it with enthusiasm. This charming, delightful and extremely funny book about daily life in a frugal English household was named by booksellers as the out-of-print novel most deserving of republication. This is a gently self-effacing, dry-witted tale of a long-suffering and disaster-prone Devon lady of the 1930s. A story of provincial social pretensions and the daily inanities of domestic life to rival George Grossmith's Diary of a Nobody.	388	1930		Devonshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/249823.Diary_of_a_Provincial_Lady
