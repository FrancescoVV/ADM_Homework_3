The Blue Girl	Newford #15	Charles de Lint	3.93	9556	473	Seventeen-year-old Imogene's tough, rebellious nature has caused her more harm than good—so when her family moves to Newford, she decides to reinvent herself. She won't lose her punk/thrift-shop look, but she'll try to avoid the gangs, work a little harder at school, and maybe even stay out of trouble for a change. But trouble shows up anyway. Imogene quickly catches the eye of Redding's bullies, as well as the school's resident teen ghost. Then she gets on the wrong side of a gang of malicious fairies. When her imaginary childhood friend, Pelly, actually manifests, Imogene realizes that the impossible is all too real. And it's dangerous. If she wants to survive high school—not to mention stay alive—she has to fall back on the skills she picked up in her hometown, running with a gang. Even with Maxine and some unexpected allies by her side, will her new friend be able to make it?	368	October 4th 2004	Jilly Coppercorn, Christy Riddell, Geordie Riddell, Cerin Songweaver, Saskia Madding, Christiana Tree, Isabelle Copley, Janey Little, Felix Gavin, Grace Quintero, Max Trader, Zeffy Lacerda	Newford	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182332.The_Blue_Girl
