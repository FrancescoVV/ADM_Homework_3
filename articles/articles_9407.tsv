The Borgia Bride		Jeanne Kalogridis	3.85	10228	531	Vivacious Sancha of Aragon arrives in Rome newly wed to a member of the notorious Borgia dynasty. Surrounded by the city's opulence and political corruption, she befriends her glamorous and deceitful sister-in-law, Lucrezia, whose jealousy is as legendary as her beauty. Some say Lucrezia has poisoned her rivals, particularly those to whom her handsome brother, Cesare, has given his heart. So when Sancha falls under Cesare's irresistible spell, she must hide her secret or lose her life. Caught in the Borgias' sinister web, she summons her courage and uses her cunning to outwit them at their own game. Vividly interweaving historical detail with fiction, The Borgia Bride is a richly compelling tale of conspiracy, sexual intrigue, loyalty, and drama.	509	February 7th 2005	Cesare Borgia, Lucrezia Borgia, Giovanni Borgia, Alfonso of Aragon, Sancha of Aragon	Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200352.The_Borgia_Bride
