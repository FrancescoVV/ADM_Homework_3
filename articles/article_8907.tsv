The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie	Mackenzies & McBrides #1	Jennifer Ashley	4.05	29690	2658	The year is 1881. Meet the Mackenzie family—rich, powerful, dangerous, eccentric. A lady couldn't be seen with them without ruin. Rumors surround them—of tragic violence, of their mistresses, of their dark appetites, of scandals that set England and Scotland abuzz. The youngest brother, Ian, known as the Mad Mackenzie, spent most of his young life in an asylum, and everyone agrees he is decidedly odd. He's also hard and handsome and has a penchant for Ming pottery and beautiful women. Beth Ackerley, widow, has recently come into a fortune. She has decided that she wants no more drama in her life. She was raised in drama—an alcoholic father who drove them into the workhouse, a frail mother she had to nurse until her death, a fussy old lady she became constant companion to. No, she wants to take her money and find peace, to travel, to learn art, to sit back and fondly remember her brief but happy marriage to her late husband. And then Ian Mackenzie decides he wants her. The first of a new historical series.	320	April 28th 2009	Lord Ian Mackenzie, Beth (Ackerley) Mackenzie, Isabella (Scranton) Mackenzie, Daniel Mackenzie, Hart Mackenzie, Duke of Kilmorgan, Lord Cameron Mackenzie, Lord Roland "Mac" Mackenzie, Lloyd Fellows	London, England (United Kingdom), Paris (France), Castle Kilmorgan, Scotland (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5981872-the-madness-of-lord-ian-mackenzie
