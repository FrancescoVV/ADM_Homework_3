Love's Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy		Irvin D. Yalom	4.22	25034	1086	The collection of ten absorbing tales by master psychotherapist Irvin D. Yalom uncovers the mysteries, frustrations, pathos, and humor at the heart of the therapeutic encounter. In recounting his patients' dilemmas, Yalom not only gives us a rare and enthralling glimpse into their personal desires and motivations but also tells us his own story as he struggles to reconcile his all-too human responses with his sensibility as a psychiatrist. Not since Freud has an author done so much to clarify what goes on between a psychotherapist and a patient.	304	1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21027.Love_s_Executioner_and_Other_Tales_of_Psychotherapy
