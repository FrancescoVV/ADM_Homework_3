When the group rescues a dog caged for medical testing on a nearby island, they are exposed to an experimental strain of canine parvovirus that changes their lives forever. As the friends discover their heightened senses and animal-quick reflexes, they must combine their scientific curiosity with their newfound physical gifts to solve a cold-case murder that has suddenly become very hot if they can stay alive long enough to catch the killer's scent. Fortunately, they are now more than friends. They're a pack. They are Virals .	454	November 2nd 2010	Temperance Brennan, Tory Brennan, Ben Blue, Hiram Stolowitski, Shelton Devers	Charleston, South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7800188-virals
