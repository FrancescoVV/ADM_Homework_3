Kelsey's summer should have been paradise: An invitation to rich and famous Beverly Island, complete with sun-drenched beaches and three gorgeous lifeguards on duty. But Kelsey's summer is the opposite of paradise. It starts with the note under her pillow from a girl who's missing. Then there's the crazy man in the lighthouse who won't leave Kelsey alone. And there have been a number of suspicious drownings.... At least she has the lifeguards around to protect her.... Poor Kelsey. Someone forgot to tell her that lifeguards don't always like to save lives.	224	June 1st 1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1156197.The_Lifeguard
