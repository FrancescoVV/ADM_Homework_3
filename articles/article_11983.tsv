Discovering that Caitlyn has planned to force Laird Alexander MacLean into marrying her by stowing away in his coach, Triond sneaks inside MacLean’s coach to dissuade her sister. But Triond gets trapped inside when the coach takes off—and it’s not Alex MacLean who discovers her, but his brother Hugh. Distracted by the heat that burns fiercely between them, he doesn’t realize that he’s gotten the wrong sister until it’s too late...	355	July 9th 2009	Catriona Hurst, Hugh MacLean	Scottish Highlands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5979401-sleepless-in-scotland
