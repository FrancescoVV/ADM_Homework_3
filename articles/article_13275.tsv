Thunder Bay	Cork O'Connor #7	William Kent Krueger	4.19	6165	563	Henry Meloux, Cork's friend and spiritual advisor, asks the Minnesota sheriff turned private investigator to find Henry's long-lost son. Cork tracks the man to the Canadian town of Thunder Bay, Ontario, where it turns out he's a prominent (if reclusive) industrialist. When someone tries to kill Henry, and the evidence points to his son, Cork digs deep into his old friend's personal history, where he uncovers truths that might be best left buried.	280	July 24th 2007	Cork O'Connor		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1153501.Thunder_Bay
