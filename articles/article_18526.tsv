Singing Lizards		Evadeen Brickwood	4.22	9	5	Bridget Reinhold is not exactly the adventurous type, but when her sister Claire disappears in Southern Africa, nothing can keep her in England. Bridget launches herself into the search in Botswana and hits one obstacle after the other. Not all of them entirely unpleasant. Soon, her mission is plunged into turmoil as everything seems to be going wrong. Just coincidence or is there something not so normal at work?	304	March 12th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33278687-singende-eidechsen
