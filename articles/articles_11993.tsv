Aspho Fields	Gears of War #1	Karen Traviss	4.10	3370	223	For the first time, fans of the blockbuster Gears of War video games get an in-depth look at Delta Squad’s toughest fighters–soldier’s soldier Marcus Fenix and rock-solid Dominic Santiago–as well as a detailed account of the pivotal battle of the Pendulum Wars. As kids, the three of them were inseparable; as soldiers, they were torn apart. Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago fought alongside Dom’s elder brother Carlos at Aspho Fields in the epic battle that changed the course of the Pendulum Wars. There’s a new war to fight now, a war for mankind’s very survival. But while the last human stronghold on Sera braces itself for another onslaught from the Locust Horde, ghosts come back to haunt Marcus and Dom. For Marcus–decorated war hero, convicted traitor–the return of an old comrade threatens to dredge up an agonizing secret he’s sworn to keep. As the beleaguered Gears of the Coalition of Ordered Governments take a last stand to save mankind from extermination, the harrowing decisions made at Aspho Fields have to be re-lived and made again. Marcus and Dom can take anything the Locust Horde throws at them–but will their friendship survive the truth about Carlos Santiago?	400	January 1st 2008	Marcus Fenix, Dominic Santiago, Augustus Cole, Damon Baird, Helena Stroud, Anya Stroud, Victor Hoffmann, Carlos Santiago, Bernadette "Bernie" Mataki, Adam Fenix, Elain Fenix, Maria Santiago, Tai Kaliso, Bai Tak, Padrick Salton, Queen Myrrah, Quentin Michaelson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929272-aspho-fields
