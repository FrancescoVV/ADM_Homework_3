Chain of Gold	The Last Hours #1	Cassandra Clare	4.48	37953	6990	Chain of Gold , a Shadowhunters novel, is the first novel in a brand-new trilogy where evil hides in plain sight and love cuts deeper than any blade. . Cordelia Carstairs is a Shadowhunter, a warrior trained since childhood to battle demons. When her father is accused of a terrible crime, she and her brother travel to London in hopes of preventing the family’s ruin. Cordelia’s mother wants to marry her off, but Cordelia is determined to be a hero rather than a bride. Soon Cordelia encounters childhood friends James and Lucie Herondale and is drawn into their world of glittering ballrooms, secret assignations, and supernatural salons, where vampires and warlocks mingle with mermaids and magicians. All the while, she must hide her secret love for James, who is sworn to marry someone else. But Cordelia’s new life is blown apart when a shocking series of demon attacks devastate London. These monsters are nothing like those Shadowhunters have fought before—these demons walk in daylight, strike down the unwary with incurable poison, and seem impossible to kill. London is immediately quarantined. Trapped in the city, Cordelia and her friends discover that their own connection to a dark legacy has gifted them with incredible powers—and forced a brutal choice that will reveal the true cruel price of being a hero.	672	March 3rd 2020	Theresa "Tessa" Gray, William Herondale, James "Jem" Carstairs, James Herondale, Grace Cartwright, Lucie Herondale, Christopher Lightwood, Anna Lightwood, Cordelia Carstairs, Alastair Carstairs, Jesse Blackthorn, Matthew Fairchild, Charles Buford Fairchild		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17699853-chain-of-gold
