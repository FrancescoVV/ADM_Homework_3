Swimming Home		Deborah Levy, Tom McCarthy	3.33	9982	1263	'Swimming Home' is a subversive page-turner, a merciless gaze at the insidiuos harm that depression can have on apparently stable, well-turned-out people. Set in a summer villa, the story is tautly structured, taking place over a week in which a group of beautiful, flawed tourists in the French Riviera come loose at the seams.Shortlisted for the 2012 Man Booker Prize.	165	October 6th 2011		France, CÃ´te d'Azur (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11700333-swimming-home
