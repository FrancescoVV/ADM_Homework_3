Defending Jacob		William Landay	3.98	265115	21094	Award-winning author William Landay has written the consummate novel of an embattled family in crisis - a suspenseful, character-driven mystery that is also a spellbinding tale of guilt, betrayal, and the terrifying speed at which our lives can spin out of control. Andy Barber has been an assistant district attorney in his suburban Massachusetts county for more than twenty years. He is respected in his community, tenacious in the courtroom, and happy at home with his wife, Laurie, and son, Jacob. But when a shocking crime shatters their New England town, Andy is blindsided by what happens next: His fourteen-year-old son is charged with the murder of a fellow student.	421	January 31st 2012	Andy Barber, Jacob Barber, Laurie Barber, Ben Rifkin, Dan Rifkin, Jonathan Klein, Neal Logiudice, Father O'Leary, Paul Duffy, Derek Yoo, Leonard Patz	Massachusetts (United States), Newton, Massachussets (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11367726-defending-jacob
