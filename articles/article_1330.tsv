Shadow of Night	All Souls Trilogy #2	Deborah Harkness	4.05	183974	15727	Picking up from A Discovery of Witches’ cliffhanger ending, Shadow of Night takes Diana and Matthew on a trip through time to Elizabethan London, where they are plunged into a world of spies, magic, and a coterie of Matthew’s old friends, the School of Night. As the search for Ashmole 782 deepens and Diana seeks out a witch to tutor her in magic, the net of Matthew’s past tightens around them, and they embark on a very different—and vastly more dangerous—journey.	584	July 10th 2012	Diana Bishop, Matthew Clairmont, Stephen Proctor, Gallowglass de Clermont, Philippe de Clermont	London, England (United Kingdom), Saint Lucien (France), Prague (Praha) (Czech Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11559200-shadow-of-night
