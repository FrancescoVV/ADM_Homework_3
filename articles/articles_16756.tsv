Autobiography of a Sadhu: A Journey into Mystic India		Baba Rampuri	4.08	157	22	After traveling at age 18 from his native California to India in 1969, Rampuri was drawn to the Naga Babas, an ancient and wild order of naked yogis whom he calls the "Hell's Angels of Indian Spirituality." From drinking the "nectar of Immortality" at the source of the Ganges River to allegations of tantric murder, this autobiography is filled with true accounts of magic, miracles, ghosts, and austerities, with lessons on Hindu gods, ayurveda, mantra, and Indian culture woven throughout.
