Thoughtless	Thoughtless #1	S.C. Stephens	4.10	134144	9429	For almost two years now, Kiera's boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she's ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her. When they head off to a new city to start their lives together, Denny at his dream job and Kiera at a top-notch university, everything seems perfect. Then an unforeseen obligation forces the happy couple apart. Feeling lonely, confused, and in need of comfort, Kiera turns to an unexpected sourceâ€”a local rock star named Kellan Kyle. At first, he's purely a friend that she can lean on, but as her loneliness grows, so does their relationship. And then one night everything changes... and none of them will ever be the same.	530	2009	Kellan Kyle, Denny Harris, Kiera Allen		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13517535-thoughtless
