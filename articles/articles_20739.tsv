A Very Accidental Love Story		Claudia Carroll	3.73	1315	105	Eloise Elliot is one of the youngest newspaper editors in the country. Respected and revered by her peers, she's at the top of her game. But, on the eve of her thirtieth birthday, finding herself surrounded by some pathetic looking balloons and mangy sandwiches in The Daily Post's conference room, Eloise is hit but a long sharp pang of loneliness. Suddenly, and with dazzling clarity, she realises what she wants to make her life more complete. A baby. One successful trip to the sperm bank and almost three years later and she is the adoring mother of a gorgeous little girl, Lily. Juggling a high-powered job with motherhood is not easy and when she finds herself without childcare she sends an SOS to her sister Helen. Yet it's when Lily starts asking about her `daddy' that Eloise really starts to panic. What will she tell her? So Eloise decides there's nothing for it - she's going to find Lily's father. After all, she chose the perfect donor so surely there won't be any surprises. Except that there are plenty, and Eloise gets a lot more than she bargained for.	408	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15710999-a-very-accidental-love-story
