Spirit Bound	Sea Haven/Sisters of the Heart #2	Christine Feehan	4.22	7918	384	From #1 New York Times bestselling author Christine Feehan comes her stirring new novel in a magical “series of six sisters not of flesh and blood but of the heart…”* Lethal undercover agent Stefan Prakenskii knew a thousand ways to kills a man—and twice as many ways to pleasure a woman. That’s what made him look forward to his new mission: arrive in the coastal town of Sea Haven and insinuate himself in the life of an elusive beauty who had mysterious ties to his past, and a link to a dangerously seductive, and equally elusive master criminal who wanted only one thing: to possess her. Judith Henderson was an artist on the rise—an ethereal, and haunted woman whose own picture-perfect beauty stirred the souls of two men who have made her their obsession. For years she has been waiting for someone to come and unlock the passion and fire within her—waiting for the right man to surrender it to. But only one man can survive her secrets, and the shadow she has cast over both their lives.	404	January 1st 2011	Judith Henderson, Stefan Prakenskii	Sea Haven, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8736477-spirit-bound
