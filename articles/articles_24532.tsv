Models: Attract Women Through Honesty		Mark Manson	4.38	10424	655	Models is the first book ever written on seduction as an emotional process rather than a logical one, a process of connecting with women rather than impressing them. It's the most mature and honest guide on how a man can attract women without faking behavior, without lying and without emulating others. A game-changer.	246	July 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633800-models
