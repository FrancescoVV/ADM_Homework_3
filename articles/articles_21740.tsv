Skywriting by Word of Mouth and Other Writings		John Lennon, Yoko Ono	3.75	812	65	John Lennon wrote Skywriting by Word of Mouth , an impressive collection of writings and drawings, during Yoko Ono's pregnancy with Sean, and always planned to have it published. The book's publication was a wish that seemed to end with Lennon's assassination in 1980 and the theft of the manuscript from the Lennons' home in 1982. When it was recovered and first published in 1986, Skywriting received immediate critical and popular acclaim. Filled with Lennon's extraordinary creative powers and lavishly illustrated with his own drawings, the collection reveals his fertile creative spirit up close and in full force. Included in Skywriting are "Two Virgins," written when the public learned that John and Yoko were living together as husband and wife, and John's only autobiography, "The Ballad of John and Yoko." In addition there are notes on his falling in love with Yoko, the breakup of the Beatles, his persecution by U.S. authorities, and his withdrawal from public life. This is a book with John Lennon's spirit on every pageï¿½a spirit the world needs to remember.	208	January 1st 1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233922.Skywriting_by_Word_of_Mouth_and_Other_Writings
