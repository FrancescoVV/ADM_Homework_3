Believe (Rules, #1)		Lisa Alfonso	3.90	100	21	Seventeen-year-old Caspa is far from normal, which puts her in great danger in the conformist dystopia that is Astro City. When she wakes up after getting her memory swiped, she only knows the three Rules of Astro City: Believe, Beware, and Remain. She doesnâ€™t know how she got there, where she came from, or even who her parents are. You are not allowed to know anything other than what you are told.

Together the two try to plot to break out of the paralyzing city, but their escape could cost them their lives...	294	October 19th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16138637-believe
