Hostage to Pleasure	Psy-Changeling #5	Nalini Singh	4.20	27806	1298	Separated from her son and forced to create a neural implant that will mean the effective enslavement of her psychically gifted race, Ashaya Aleine is the perfect Psy--cool, calm, emotionless...at least on the surface. Inside, she's fighting a desperate battle to save her son and escape the vicious cold of the PsyNet. Yet when escape comes, it leads not to safety, but to the lethal danger of a sniper's embrace. DarkRiver sniper Dorian Christensen lost his sister to a Psy killer. Though he lacks the changeling ability to shift into animal form, his leopard lives within. And that leopard's rage at the brutal loss is a clawing darkness that hungers for vengeance. Falling for a Psy has never been on Dorian's agenda. But charged with protecting Ashaya and her son, he discovers that passion has a way of changing the rules...	330	September 2nd 2008	Sascha Duncan, Lucas Hunter, Faith Nightstar, Judd Lauren, Clay Bennett, Talin McKade, Ashaya Aleine, Mercy Smith, Nate Ryder, Tamsyn Mahaire, Dorian Christensen, Amara Aleine, Kaleb Krycheck, Vaughn D'Angelo, Anthony Kyriakus, Keenan Aleine	San Francisco Bay, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3115070-hostage-to-pleasure
