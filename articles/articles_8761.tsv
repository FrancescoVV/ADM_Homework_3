Kitty and the Dead Man's Hand	Kitty Norville #5	Carrie Vaughn	3.89	11268	457	HONEYMOON IN VEGAS? Already the alpha pair of Denver's werewolf pack, Kitty and Ben now plan to tie the knot human-style by eloping to Vegas. Kitty is looking forward to sipping frou-frou drinks by the pool and doing her popular radio show on live TV, but her hotel is stocked with werewolf-hating bounty hunters. Elsewhere on the Strip an old-school magician might be wielding the real thing; the vampire community is harboring a dark secret; and the irresistible star of a suspicious animal act is determined to seduce Kitty. Sin City has never been so wild, and this werewolf has never had to fight harder to save not only her wedding, but her very life.	282	January 1st 2009	Dominic Kitchen, Kitty Norville, Sylvia, Evan Dennison, Shaun, Cormac Bennett, Ben O'Farrell, Odysseus Grant, Ricardo (Rick) de Avila, Nick (Kitty Norville), Cheryl Norville, Balthazar (Kitty Norville), Brenda (KItty Norville), Boris Pavlikovsky (Kitty Norville)	United States of America, Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4453371-kitty-and-the-dead-man-s-hand
