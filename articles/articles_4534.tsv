The Well of Lost Plots	Thursday Next #3	Jasper Fforde	4.10	36754	1950	Protecting the world's greatest literature—not to mention keeping up wit Miss Havisham—is tiring work for an expectant mother. And Thursday can definitely use a respite. So what better hideaway than inside the unread and unreadable Caversham Heights , a cliché-ridden pulp mystery in the hidden depths of the Well of Lost Plots, where all unpublished books reside? But peace and quiet remain elusive for Thursday, who soon discovers that the Well itself is a veritable linguistic free-for-all, where grammasites run rampant, plot devices are hawked on the black market, and lousy books—like Caversham Heights —are scrapped for salvage. To top it off, a murderer is stalking Jurisdiction personnel and nobody is safe—least of all Thursday.	375	February 23rd 2004	Miss Havisham, Thursday Next, Acheron Hades, Landen Parke-Laine, Pickwick, Aornis Hades, Granny Next, David "Pinky" Perkins, Akrid Snell, Commander Trafford Bradshaw, The Minotaur, Emperor Zhark	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27001.The_Well_of_Lost_Plots
