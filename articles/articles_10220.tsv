Gideon the Cutpurse	The Gideon Trilogy #1	Linda Buckley-Archer	3.72	6346	749	1763. Gideon Seymour, cutpurse and gentleman, hides from the villainous Tar Man. Suddenly the sky peels away like fabric and from the gaping hole fall two curious-looking children. Peter Schock and Kate Dyer have fallen straight from the twenty-first century, thanks to an experiment with an antigravity machine. Before Gideon and the children have a chance to gather their wits, the Tar Man takes off with the machine -- and Kate and Peter's only chance of getting home. Soon Gideon, Kate, and Peter are swept into a journey through eighteenth-century London and form a bond that, they hope, will stand strong in the face of unfathomable treachery.	404	January 1st 2006	Peter Shock, Kate Dyer, Gideon Seymour		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/621687.Gideon_the_Cutpurse
