Embrace The Dawning	The Covenant Series #1	Betty Shreffler	4.20	187	59	Kayci Pierce’s life has been a facade, an identity to remain hidden from vampires and sorceresses alike, too powerful for them to let her live. Until a relationship with a vampire hunter brings her as much passion as it does danger. With a vampire revolution forming and an undeniable attraction she can’t suppress, she must risk it all and work with the hunter to survive surrounding threats. Tested by love, loyalty, and those who are set on betraying her— she’ll have to choose between protecting her secret or embracing her vampire sorceress birthright.	440	April 19th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38887055-embrace-the-dawning
