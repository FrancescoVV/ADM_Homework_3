Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology		David Abram	4.13	1093	137	A PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award Runner-up David Abram’s first book, The Spell of the Sensuous , hailed as “revolutionary” by the Los Angeles Times , as “daring” and “truly original” by Science , has become a classic of environmental literature. Now he returns with a startling exploration of our human entanglement with the rest of nature. As the climate veers toward catastrophe, the innumerable losses cascading through the biosphere make vividly evident the need for a metamorphosis in our relation to the living land. For too long we’ve ignored the wild intelligence of our bodies, taking our primary truths from technologies that hold the living world at a distance. Abram’s writing subverts this distance, drawing readers ever closer to their animal senses in order to explore, from within, the elemental kinship between the human body and the breathing Earth. The shape-shifting of ravens, the erotic nature of gravity, the eloquence of thunder, the pleasures of being edible: all have their place in this book.	336	January 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7822953-becoming-animal
