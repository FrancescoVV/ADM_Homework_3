Mile High	Up in the Air #2	R.K. Lilley	4.20	69448	1992	James and Bianca’s tumultuous story continues in the sequel to In Flight. James has initiated Bianca into a dark and drugging world of passion and pain. He taught her about her own submissive, masochistic nature, and she fell swiftly and deeply in love with the undeniably charming and impossibly beautiful Mr. Cavendish, but a painful misunderstanding and the return of the brutally violent demon of her past have combined to overwhelm Bianca, and, confused and hurt, she pushes him away. It’s been over a month since the shocking attack that hospitalized her, and since she told a distraught James that she needed space, but her feelings haven’t gone away. Even she knew that it was only a matter of time before he would cast his spell on her again…	283	November 2nd 2012	James Cavendish, Bianca Karlsson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16136959-mile-high
