Tales of Pirx the Pilot		Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Louis Iribarne	4.10	4969	138	In Pilot Pirx , Lem has created an irresistibly likable character: an astronaut who gives the impression of still navigating by the seat of his pants-a bumbler but an inspired one. By investing Pirx with a range of human foibles, Lem offers a wonderful vision of the audacity, childlike curiosity, and intuition that can give humans the courage to confront outer space. Translated by Louis Iribarne. A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book.	206	1961	Pirx		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28769.Tales_of_Pirx_the_Pilot
