(Un) Spoken		Dennis Sharpe	4.57	23	1	Contained in the pages of this small printed work are unapologetic texts both broad and specific in scope, telling in three parts the evolution of their architect. They range from very intimate and personal, to universal. The words presented here are intended to allow glimpses into the past and present of one man's human experience. Take from them what you will.		October 30th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11187937-un-spoken
