Demon Bound	Black London #2	Caitlin Kittredge	3.73	1803	136	Thirteen years ago, Jack Winter lay dying in a graveyard. Jack called upon a demon and traded his soul for his lifeâ€¦ and now the demon is back to collect its due. But Jack has finally found something to live for. Her name is Pete Caldecott, and because of her, Jack's not going to Hell without a fight. Pete doesn't know about Jack's bargain, but she does know that something bigger and far more dangerous than Jack's demon is growing in the Black. Old gods are stirring and spirits are rising--and Jack doesn't stand a chance of stopping them without Pete's help.	346	November 18th 2009	Pete Caldecott, Jack Winter		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6555008-demon-bound
