The Legend of Akikumo		Dani Hoots	2.95	38	28	Ketsueki would give anything to find out why her mentor Akikumo, the last wolf in Japan, abandoned her. He left her with other kitsune at the Inari Shrine, but she doesn’t fit in. And now the other kitsune are bullying her and saying Akikumo is dead. After causing trouble for the hundredth time, the Inari, instead of punishing her, has given Ketsueki a task: she must find out what happened to Akikumo. She quickly agrees, not realizing the delinquent son of the shrine’s head priest must accompany her. Will Ketsueki be able to make peace with a human? Or will her years of resentment make this partnership impossible?		September 15th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53435293-the-legend-of-akikumo
