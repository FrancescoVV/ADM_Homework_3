Gora		Rabindranath Tagore, Meenakshi Mukherjee, R. Leeladevi, Vlasta Pacheiner-Klander, Shahed Ryda, Marguerite Glotz, Radha Chakravarty, Gisela Leiste, Janko Moder, Sujit Mukherjee, Pierre Fallon	4.24	3434	226	Vast in its scope and rich in thought Gora has been acclaimed as a monumental work in the history of Bengali fiction. The story reflects the social, political and religious scene in Bengal at the turn of the century. The forces that were operating in Bengal at that time were one of the intense nationalism and revival of ancient spiritual values and also that of liberal western thought. What makes Gora a great prose epic is not only its social content but also its brilliant story of self-searching, of resolution, of conflicts and of self discovery.	580	1910			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268541.Gora
