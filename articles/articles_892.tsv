Dark Places		Gillian Flynn	3.93	581646	35771	From The #1 New York Times Bestselling Author Of Gone Girl Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice" of Kinnakee, Kansas. She survived—and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer.	349	May 5th 2009	Libby Day, Ben Day, Patty Day, Ronald 'Runner' Day, Diondra Wertzner	Kinnakee, Kansas (United States), Kansas City, Missouri (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5886881-dark-places
