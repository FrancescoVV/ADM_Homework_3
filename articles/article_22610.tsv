The Lonely Astronaut On Christmas Eve		Tom DeLonge, Mike Henry	4.62	133	12	When not on the road with his bands, blink-182 and Angels & Airwaves frontman Tom DeLonge always made it a point to read to his children, Ava and Jonas. Now the punk-rock papa is proud to share some of his story time with the world, through the release of his first childrenâ€™s book THE LONELY ASTRONAUT ON CHRISTMAS EVE. This book, written by DeLonge, is a wistful story for the young and the young-at-heart alike. Wonderfully illustrated by Mike Henry, THE LONELY ASTRONAUT ON CHRISTMAS EVE, is a tale of a rocketeer alone on the moon on a cold Christmas night, and the gift he receives from a few unexpected (and extraterrestrial) friends.	28	November 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18877915-the-lonely-astronaut-on-christmas-eve
