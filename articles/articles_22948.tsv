Absolute Y: The Last Man, Volume 3	Absolute Y: The Last Man #3	Brian K. Vaughan, Pia Guerra	4.34	100	11	The concluding volume to Brian K. Vaughan's hit series, now given the Absolute treatment! Y: THE LAST MAN, winner of three Eisner Awards and one of the most critically acclaimed, best-selling comic book series of the last decade, is that rare example of a page-turner that is at once humorous, socially relevant and endlessly surprising. Written by Brian K. Vaughan ( Lost , PRIDE OF BAGHDAD, EX MACHINA) and with art by Pia Guerra, this is the saga of Yorick Brown--the only human survivor of a planet-wide plague that instantly kills every mammal possessing a Y chromosome. Accompanied by a mysterious government agent, a brilliant young geneticist and his pet monkey, Ampersand, Yorick travels the world in search of his lost love and the answer to why he's the last man on Earth. This Absolute Edition will feature the gripping continuation of this action-packed series along with special script pages, character sketches and a cover gallery.	544	July 4th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33252316-absolute-y
