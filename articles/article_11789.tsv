The Captain is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship		Charles Bukowski, Robert Crumb	3.92	4983	273	A book length collaboration between two underground legends, Charles Bukowski and Robert Crumb. Bukowski's last journals candidly and humorously reveal the events in the writer's life as death draws inexorably nearer, thereby illuminating our own lives and natures, and to give new meaning to what was once only familiar. Crumb has illustrated the text with 12 full-page drawings and a portrait of Bukowski.	144	1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61354.The_Captain_is_Out_to_Lunch_and_the_Sailors_Have_Taken_Over_the_Ship
