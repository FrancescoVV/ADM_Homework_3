The Mane Attraction	Pride #3	Shelly Laurenston	4.27	12814	539	Even the king of the beasts can find himself unexpectedly tamed by the right woman. Weddings have the strangest effect on people. Exhibit 1: Sissy Mae waking up in Mitch Shaw's bed the morning after her brother Bobby Ray's nuptials. Exhibit 2: the gunmen trying to kill Mitch. Exhibit 3: Sissy Mae escorting a bleeding yet sexy lion shifter to her Tennessee Pack's turf for safe keeping. It doesn't help that Mitch's appraising gaze makes her feel like the most desirable creature on earth. . . Mitch is an undercover cop about to testify against some dangerous ex-associates. Even more worrisome, he's harboring hot, X-rated fantasies about one fast-talking little canine--and he has to deal with every male in Sissy Mae's Pack sniffing around her in a way that makes his hackles rise. Mitch has his pride, and he intends to show Sissy Mae that when a lion sets out to make you his mate, the only thing to do is purr, roll over, and enjoy one hell of a ride. . .	346	November 1st 2008	Sissy Mae Smith, Mitchell “Mitch” Shaw	New York City, New York (United States), Smithtown, Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3301564-the-mane-attraction
