The Archmage Unbound	Mageborn #3	Michael G. Manning	4.19	8207	95	Mordecaiâ€™s growing power and success have made him a threat, not just to the gods and their minions, but also to the king of Lothion. An unholy bargain has been struck to bring him to heel and increasingly it seems that victory may not be worth the price, not if the cost is measured in the blood of his family. Wizard, lord, husband, father, and now archmage... no man can balance so many roles without sacrificing something. Will the world be worth saving if it costs him the very reasons he has for living in it?	545	May 15th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13839194-the-archmage-unbound
