We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea	Swallows and Amazons #7	Arthur Ransome	4.25	1950	118	In this latest adventure (following Pigeon Post , winner of the Carnegie Medal), the Walker family has come to Harwich to wait for Commander Walker's return. As usual, the children can't stay away from boats, and this time they meet young Jim Brading, skipper of the well-found sloop Goblin. But fun turns to high drama when the anchor drags, and the four young sailors find themselves drifting out to sea - sweeping across to Holland in the midst of a full gale! As in all of Ransome's books, the emphasis is on self-reliance, courage, and resourcefulness. We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea is a story to warm any mariner's heart. Full of nautical lore and adventure, it will appeal to young armchair sailors and season sailors alike.	352	1937			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/979766.We_Didn_t_Mean_to_Go_to_Sea
