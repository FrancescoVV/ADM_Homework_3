Lovely and tempestuous Casey Straton, the headstrong child of Chandos Straton and Courtney Harte, leaves her Texas home determined to prove to her parents that she can do more than "woman′s work". Successful businessman Damien Rutledge III came West looking for vengeance. But though he is strong and fearless, the handsome Eastern "dude" would have surely been lost in the wild West were it not for the timely intervention of a half-pint bounty hunter called "Kid". But when Damien discovers his rescuer is, in fact, a stunningly sensuous young lady named Casey in disguise, he realises that there are going to be very serious complications on the rocky trail that is leading them both toward a dangerous, irrepressible love.	403	1997	Chandos, Casey Straton, Damian Rutledge III, Courtney Straton	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/412969.All_I_Need_Is_You
