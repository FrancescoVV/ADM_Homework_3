The Way of Men		Jack   Donovan	3.83	4584	400	The Way of Men answers the question: “What is Masculinity?” The so-called experts give the answers that suit their masters. They tell just-so stories to protect their ideology, their religion, their way of life. They look to women for a nod of approval before speaking. They give socially acceptable answers and half-truths. If what they have to say resonates with men, it is only because they manage to hint at the real answer. The real answer is that The Way of Men is The Way of The Gang. Manliness — being good at being a man — isn’t about impressing women. That’s a side effect of manliness. Manliness isn’t about being a good man. There are plenty of bad guys – real jerks –who are manlier than you are, and you know it. Manliness is about demonstrating to other men that you have what it takes to survive tough times. Manliness is about our primal nature. It’s about what men have always needed from each other if they wanted to win struggles against nature, and against other men. The Way of Men describes the four tactical virtues of the survival gang. The Way of Men explains what men want, and why they are rapidly disengaging from our child-proofed modern world. The Way of Men examines the alternatives, and sketches a path out of our “bonobo masturbation society” through a new Dark Age.	170	March 22nd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13572289-the-way-of-men
