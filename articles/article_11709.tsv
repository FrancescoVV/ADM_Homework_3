Companions of the Night		Vivian Vande Velde	3.77	5849	431	When Kerry's little brother forgets his stuffed bear at the laundry, Kerry ventures out at 11th p.m. to retrieve it for him. The laundry is deserted and kind of spooky, and while she's there three men burst in, dragging a bound and bloodied young man they insist is a vampire. Kerry helps him escape, only to be caught up in a desperate game between vampire hunters and their prey. «Full of tension and familiar vampire lore-and with a touch of romance-this should find a wide YA audience.» Booklist	212	April 18th 1995	Kerry Nowicki, Ethan Bryne	Brockport, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248533.Companions_of_the_Night
