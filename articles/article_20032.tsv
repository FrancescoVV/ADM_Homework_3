In Your Room		Jordanna Fraiberg	3.84	1434	130	Molly and Charlie have fallen head over heels in love, although they've never met. Molly is a fashion-conscious city girl in L.A., and Charlie is an earthy, mountain-biking dude from Boulder, Colorado. Each of them has big plans with their respective friends for the summer until they discover that their parents decide to swap houses! Luckily there's no amount of homesickness that a bit of snooping can't cure. Charlie and Molly begin crawling under beds and poking around in closets to find out a little more about each other. Can Charlie and Molly's long-distance romance survive jealousy, misunderstandings and the thousand miles between them?	203	October 1st 2008		Los Angeles, California (United States), Boulder, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3231008-in-your-room
