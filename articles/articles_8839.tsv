How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire	Love at Stake #1	Kerrelyn Sparks	3.85	34427	1829	Nobody said love was perfect... Roman Draganesti is charming, handsome, rich...he's also a vampire. But this vampire just lost one of his fangs sinking his teeth into something he shouldn't have. Now he has one night to find a dentist before his natural healing abilities close the wound, leaving him a lop-sided eater for all eternity. Things aren't going well for Shanna Whelan, either. After witnessing a gruesome murder, she's next on the mob's hit list. And her career as a dentist appears to be on a downward spiral, because she's afraid of blood. When Roman rescues her from an assassination attempt, she wonders if she's found the one man who can keep her alive. Though the attraction between them is immediate and hot, can Shanna conquer her fear of blood to fix Roman's fang? And if she does, what will prevent Roman from using his fangs on her?	371	July 26th 2005	Roman Draganesti, Shanna Whelan	New York City, New York (United States), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263179.How_to_Marry_a_Millionaire_Vampire
