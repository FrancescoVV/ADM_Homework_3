White Hot	Hidden Legacy #2	Ilona Andrews	4.49	29924	2679	Nevada Baylor has a unique and secret skill—she knows when people are lying—and she's used that magic (along with plain, hard work) to keep her colorful and close-knit family's detective agency afloat. But her new case pits her against the shadowy forces that almost destroyed the city of Houston once before, bringing Nevada back into contact with Connor "Mad" Rogan. Rogan is a billionaire Prime—the highest rank of magic user—and as unreadable as ever, despite Nevada's "talent." But there's no hiding the sparks between them. Now that the stakes are even higher, both professionally and personally, and their foes are unimaginably powerful, Rogan and Nevada will find that nothing burns like ice . . .	389	May 30th 2017	Nevada Baylor, Connor "Mad" Rogan, Penelope Baylor, Grandma Frida, Catalina Baylor, Arabella Baylor, Leon Baylor, Cornelius Harrison, Troy Linman, Matilda Harrison, Rynda Sherwood, Bern Baylor, Augustine Montgomery, Bug	Houston, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22303684-white-hot
