The Outcast	Guardians of Ga'Hoole #8	Kathryn Lasky	4.09	7296	137	Haunted by his past, hunted by the Pure Ones, Nyroc flies alone. He yearns to go to the great tree, where good and learned owls do noble deeds, but he cannot. He is son of Kludd and Nyra, sworn enemies of all Gaâ€™Hoole stands for, feared and despised everywhere. By Nyroc has glimpsed hope-and a new destiny-in the flame over his father's very bones. In search of that destiny, he trains his gaze and beats his wings toward a dark, lawless place where desperate characters roam a barren landscape and fire splits the sky-The Beyond the Beyond.	207	September 1st 2005	Digger (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Nyra, Soren (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Gylfie, Twilight (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Ezylryb, Octavia (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Hortense/Mist, Streak, Zan, Mrs. Plithiver, Eglantine, Kludd, Boron, Barran, Otulissa, The Rogue Smith of Silverveil, Nyroc/Coryn, Gwyndor, Hamish, Duncan MacDuncan, Dunleavy MacHeath, Gyllbane, Slynella, Stingyll, Uglamore, Wortmore, Fengo, Stryker (Guardians of Ga'Hoole)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7022.The_Outcast
