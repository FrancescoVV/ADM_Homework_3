Pointe		Brandy Colbert	3.76	4382	829	Theo is better now. She's eating again, dating guys who are almost appropriate, and well on her way to becoming an elite ballet dancer. But when her oldest friend, Donovan, returns home after spending four long years with his kidnapper, Theo starts reliving memories about his abductionâ€”and his abductor. Donovan isn't talking about what happened, and even though Theo knows she didn't do anything wrong, telling the truth would put everything she's been living for at risk. But keeping quiet might be worse.	352	April 10th 2014		Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13360957-pointe
