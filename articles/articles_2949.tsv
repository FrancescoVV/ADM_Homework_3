River Marked	Mercy Thompson #6	Patricia Briggs	4.28	77770	3730	Mercy Thompson: Mechanic, Shapeshifter, Fighter. Car mechanic Mercy Thompson has always known there was something different about her, and not just the way she can make a VW engine sit up and beg. Mercy is a shapeshifter, a talent she inherited from her long-gone father. And she's never known any others of her kind. Until now. As Mercy comes to terms with this new information, an evil is stirring in the depths of the Columbia River. Something deadly is coming, facts are thin on the ground and Mercy feels ill at ease. However, her father's people may know more. To have any hope of surviving, Mercy and her mate, the Alpha werewolf Adam, will need all the resources the shifters can offer. Or death will be the least of their worries.	326	March 1st 2011	Adam Hauptman, Samuel Cornick, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Kyle Brooks, Stefan Uccello, Coyote (Mercy Thompson), Auriele Zao, Uncle Mike, Margi Thompson, Ben Shaw	Oregon (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8087906-river-marked
