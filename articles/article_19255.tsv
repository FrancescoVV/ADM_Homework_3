Gods’ Food	Indigo Diaries #1	Sahara Sanders	4.88	8	5	Mystical Occurrences in a Village near the Lake... From the outside, Emily’s childhood in a marvelous village by the lake seemed like a fairy-tale. Adventures with her cousins and friends, wonders of nature, and the shore… each day brought another mystery, and she perceived the ways of the world as only a child can. But as Emma grows, she becomes aware of something bizarre. She is not like her friends; she is an ALIEN in her own family. She can see and do things other people can’t. Strange, inexplicable occurrences fill her life and reveal the astonishing truth: Emily is special… Where others see coincidences, the girl sees hidden paths of the Universe, calling her to cross the boundary of the paranormal. Gods’ Food combines a childhood memoir with a deeper look at the world round us, and the supernatural miracles we take for granted. There’s more to this world than we can imagine, if we but open our minds. The story of Emma Smith, from her first memories staying at her grandmother’s house with her cousins Billy and Tilly Fifer, through her infancy years and to the turbulent period of becoming an adolescent, is told with vivid recollection and attention to detail in this heart-warming and reflective book.
