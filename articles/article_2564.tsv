Bel-Ami		Guy de Maupassant, Douglas Parmée, Alev Özgüner	3.85	29485	1361	Guy de Maupassant's scandalous tale of an opportunistic young man corrupted by the allure of power, "Bel-Ami" is translated with an introduction by Douglas Parmee in "Penguin Classics". Young, attractive and very ambitious, George Duroy, known to his admirers as Bel-Ami, is offered a job as a journalist on La Vie francaise and soon makes a great success of his new career. But he also comes face to face with the realities of the corrupt society in which he lives - the sleazy colleagues, the manipulative mistresses, and wily financiers - and swiftly learns to become an arch-seducer, blackmailer and social climber in a world where love is only a means to an end. Written when Maupassant was at the height of his powers, "Bel-Ami" is a novel of great frankness and cynicism, but it is also infused with the sheer joy of life - depicting the scenes and characters of Paris in the belle epoque with wit, sensitivity, and humanity. Douglas Parmee's translation captures all the vigour and vitality of Maupassant's novel. His introduction explores the similarities between Bel-Ami and Maupassant himself and demonstrates the skill with which the author depicts his large cast of characters and the French society of the Third Republic.	416	1885	Rachel, Georges Duroy (Du Roy), Charles Forestier, Madeleine Forestier (Du Roy), Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu, Comte de Vaudrec, Clotilde de Marelle, Laurine de Marelle, Jacques Rival, Norbert de Varenne, Monsieur Walter, Virginie Walter, Suzanne Walter	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/780581.Bel_Ami
