For a Glory and a Covering: A Practical Theology of Marriage		Douglas Wilson	4.33	171	38	"Lord, here am I. Change him." "God, I'm trying. She started it." Common claims but they're so far from Trinitarian life. We invoke Christ at the wedding then seem to default to an alien theology afterward. In this simple and practical book, Doug Wilson offers a richer and more comprehensive theology of marriage than in his prior works. Here he grounds marriage in the life of the Trinity and in the life of the church. Marriage is intended to be a glorious picture of the gospel, and marriages grounded elsewhere regularly create a small hell on earth. Don't miss the riches of marriage.	149	November 27th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/547280.For_a_Glory_and_a_Covering
