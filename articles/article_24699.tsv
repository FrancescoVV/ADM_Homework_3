Dragon Prophecy	Sea Dragons Trilogy #3	Ava Richardson	4.48	141	14	From humble beginnings, a heroine will be forged in fire. Forced to retreat from the Army of the Dead with her remaining force of Raiders and their dragons, Lila begins to despair that her people will ever be anything but a ragtag band. Even wielding the fabled crown of Roskilde, she cannot unite the Raiders—it seems she is not the one to fulfill Danu’s cherished prophecy. But Danu isn’t giving up yet. Though he suspects the evil Havick has obtained an ancient book that will allow him unspeakable power, help may come from an unlikely source: the Dragon Riders of Torvald. These brave warriors could be their last chance to defeat the evil of Lars and Havick—but they are also the Raiders’ sworn enemies. Now, Lila, Danu, Crux, and their friends have no choice but to make a perilous journey into hostile territory to seek allies against the darkness threatening to consume them all. To save her friends, Lila must become the legendary leader she was born to be.	283	July 25th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40224081-dragon-prophecy
