Raintree County		Ross Lockridge Jr.	3.95	944	81	Throughout a single day in 1892, John Shawnessy recalls the great moments of his lifeÂ—from the love affairs of his youth in Indiana, to the battles of the Civil War, to the politics of the Gilded Age, to his homecoming as schoolteacher, husband, and father. Shawnessy is the epitome of the place and period in which he lives, a rural land of springlike women, shady gamblers, wandering vagabonds, and soapbox orators. Yet here on the banks of the Shawmucky River, which weaves its primitive course through Raintree County, Indiana, he also feels and obeys ancient rhythms. A number-one bestseller when it was first published in 1948, this powerful novel is a compelling vision of 19th-century America with timeless resonance.	1088	January 1st 1948		Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257233.Raintree_County
