Ico: Castle in the Mist		Miyuki Miyabe	3.64	906	81	When a boy named Ico grows long curved horns overnight, his fate has been sealed-he is to be sacrificed in the Castle in the Mist. But in the castle, Ico meets a young girl named Yorda imprisoned in its halls. Alone they will die, but together Ico and Yorda might just be able to defy their destinies and escape the magic of the castle. Based on the video game filmmaker Guillemo del Toro ( Hellboy , Pan's Labyrinth ) called a "masterpiece", Japan's leading fantasist Miyuki Miyabe has crafted a tale of magic, loss, and love that will never be forgotten.	370	January 1st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9766063-ico
