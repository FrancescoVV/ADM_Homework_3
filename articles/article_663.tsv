Tempted	House of Night #6	P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast	3.95	152884	3411	So…you’d think after banishing an immortal being and a fallen High Priestess, saving Stark’s life, biting Heath, getting a headache from Erik, and almost dying, Zoey Redbird would catch a break. Sadly, a break is not in the House of Night school forecast for the High Priestess in training and her gang. Juggling three guys is anything but a stress reliever, especially when one of them is a sexy Warrior who is so into protecting Zoey that he can sense her emotions. Speaking of stress, the dark force lurking in the tunnels under the Tulsa Depot is spreading, and Zoey is beginning to believe Stevie Rae could be responsible for a lot more than a group of misfit red fledglings. Aphrodite’s visions warn Zoey to stay away from Kalona and his dark allure, but they also show that it is Zoey who has the power to stop the evil immortal.Soon it becomes obvious that Zoey has no choice: if she doesn’t go to Kalona he will exact a fiery vengeance on those closest to her. Will Zoey have the courage to chance losing her life, her heart, and her soul?	319	October 23rd 2009	Zoey Redbird, Dragon, Nyx (House of Night), Erik Night, Stevie Rae Johnson, Neferet, Heath Luck, Aphrodite LaFont, Kalona, Sylvia Redbird, Erin Bates, Shaunee Cole, Damien Maslin, James Stark, Jack Twist, Rephaim, Darius Langley	United States of America, Tulsa, Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6262365-tempted
