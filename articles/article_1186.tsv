The Thief Lord		Cornelia Funke	3.96	87430	4032	Two orphaned children are on the run, hiding among the crumbling canals and misty alleyways of the city of Venice. Befriended by a gang of street children and their mysterious leader, the Thief Lord, they shelter in an old, disused cinema. On their trail is a bungling detective, obsessed with disguises and the health of his pet tortoises. But a greater threat to the boys' new-found freedom is something from a forgotten past â€“ a beautiful magical treasure with the power to spin time itself.	350	January 2000	Scipio Massimo, Prosper Hartlieb, Boniface Hartlieb, Caterina 'Hornet' Grimani, Riccio, Mosca, Ida Spavento, Esther Hartlieb, Victor Getz, Ernesto Barbarossa, Max Hartlieb, Conte, Contessa	Venice (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113304.The_Thief_Lord
