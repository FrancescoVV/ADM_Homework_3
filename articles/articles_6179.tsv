A Night to Remember		Walter Lord, Nathaniel Philbrick	4.04	17262	1396	First published in 1955, A Night to Remember remains a completely riveting account of the Titanic 's fatal collision and the behavior of the passengers and crew, both noble and ignominious. Some sacrificed their lives, while others fought like animals for their own survival. Wives beseeched husbands to join them in lifeboats; gentlemen went taut-lipped to their deaths in full evening dress; and hundreds of steerage passengers, trapped below decks, sought help in vain.	208	1955		Southampton, England, North Atlantic (United States), Atlantic Ocean	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61834.A_Night_to_Remember
