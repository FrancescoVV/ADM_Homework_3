River of Fire	Warriors: A Vision of Shadows #5	Erin Hunter	4.44	1802	102	A shadow has fallen across the warrior Clans. The return of the long-lost SkyClan has ushered in a time of unprecedented change and upheaval, and one of the proudest warrior Clans is no more. ShadowClan has given up its territory. Its remaining warriors have joined SkyClan, and its former leader, Rowanclaw, has abandoned the name StarClan once gave him. Some cats are content to accept this fragile new peace. But StarClan warns of a storm building on the horizon . . . and Alderheart, Violetshine, and Twigpaw must fight for not only their Clanmates and kin, but all five warrior Clans.	352	April 10th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068492-river-of-fire
