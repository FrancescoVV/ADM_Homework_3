The Custom of the Country		Edith Wharton, Linda Wagner-Martin	4.03	9939	989	Considered by many to be her masterpiece, Edith Wharton's epic work is a scathing yet personal examination of the exploits and follies of the modern upper class. As she unfolds the story of Undine Spragg, from New York to Europe, Wharton affords us a detailed glimpse of what might be called the interior d√©cor of this America and its nouveau riche fringes. Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine's marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted. - Anita Brookner	370	1913	Undine Spragg, Abner Spragg, Leota Spragg, Elmer Moffatt, Ralph Marvell, Claud Popple, Peter Van Degen, Clare Van Degen, Laura Fairford, Mabel Lipscomb, Charles Bowen, Raymond de Chelles	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26950.The_Custom_of_the_Country
