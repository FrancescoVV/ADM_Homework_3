Chapter One: You have the power to change stuff		Daniel Flynn	4.20	606	85	CHAPTER ONE is a story of epic proportions by Thankyou co-founder Daniel Flynn. It’s a bumpy and entertaining ride of gut-wrenching decisions, wild mistakes and daring moves into business, marketing, social enterprise and beyond. Follow the journey of three Australian kids from Melbourne with zero business experience and the shared belief that we all have the power to change stuff. Chapter One is more than a book. It’s an invitation, addressed to you. To inspire you to challenge what you know and remind you that crazy ideas can become a reality. It’s also an opportunity to be a part of something big. Something that could change the course of history.	254	February 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29391367-chapter-one
