When the Wind Blows	When the Wind Blows #1	James Patterson	3.93	46243	1624	Frannie O'Neill is a caring young veterinarian living in the Colorado Rockies, trying to erase the memory of her beloved husband's mysterious murder. It is not long before another neighbor suddenly dies, and FBI agent Kit Harrison arrives at Frannie's doorstep. Kit is hell-bent on solving the heinous case despite resounding protests from the FBI and the thrashing of his own internal demons. Kit secretly pursues the investigation, yet witnesses keep turning up dead. Then Frannie stumbles upon an astonishing discovery in the nearby woods, and their lives are altered in ways they could never have imagined. Simply knowing the secret of Max -- the terrified 11-year-old girl with an amazing gift -- could mean death. As more and more diabolical details are unearthed, the murderer's bloody trail ultimately leads the trio to an underground lab network, known as "the School." Here scientists conduct shockingly incomprehensible experiments involving children and genetic alteration.	416	October 28th 1998	Dr. Frannie O'Neill, Kit Harrison, Maximum, Ozymandius, Wendy Miller, Icarus (James Patterson), Peter Churchman	Bear Bluff, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13162.When_the_Wind_Blows
