His life was divided by political duties and poetry, the most of famous of which was inspired by his meeting with Bice Portinari, whom he called Beatrice,including La Vita Nuova and The Divine Comedy . He died in Ravenna in 1321.	798	1320	Virgilio (Publius Vergilius Maro), Lucifer, Odysseus, Achilles (Greek hero), Dante Alighieri, Gaius Cassius Longinus, Brutus, Attila the Hun, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Cleopatra, Trajan (emperor), Cerberus, Roland, Dido of Carthage, Julius Caesar, Charon (mythology), Beatrice (Dante), Francesca da Rimini, Saul (biblical king), Judas Iscariot, Mary (mother of Jesus)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6656.The_Divine_Comedy
