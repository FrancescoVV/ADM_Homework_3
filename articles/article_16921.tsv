Eminent Victorians		Lytton Strachey	3.76	2072	143	Few books have had such an impact on their own generation as did Eminent Victorians, which exposed the hypocrisy of the Victorian era by deflating the legends surrounding four of its most notable figures. In the process, Strachey revitalized the art of biography.	571	1918	Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Thomas Arnold, Charles George Gordon		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108824.Eminent_Victorians
