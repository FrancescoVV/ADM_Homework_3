Up Country	Paul Brenner #2	Nelson DeMille	4.03	17080	843	The last thing Paul Brenner wanted to do was return to work for the Army's Criminal Investigative Division, an organization that thanked him for his many years of dedicated service by forcing him into early retirement. But when his former boss calls in a career's worth of favors, Paul finds himself investigating a murder that took place back in Vietnam thirty years before. Now, returning to a time and place that still haunts him, Paul is swept up in the battle of his life as he struggles to find justice.	880	January 29th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33820.Up_Country
