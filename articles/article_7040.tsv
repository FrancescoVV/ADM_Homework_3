The Last Day of a Condemned Man		Victor Hugo, Geoff Woollen, Libby Purves	4.03	16212	1084	Deeply shocking in its time, The Last Day of a Condemned Man is a profound and moving tale and a vital work of social commentary. A man vilified by society and condemned to death for his crime wakes every morning knowing that this day might be his last. With the hope for release his only comfort, he spends his hours recounting his life and the time before his imprisonment. But as the hours pass, he knows that he is powerless to change his fate. He must follow the path so many have trod before himâ€”the path that leads to the guillotine.	109	1829		France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63040.The_Last_Day_of_a_Condemned_Man
