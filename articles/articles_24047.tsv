Master and Man by Leo Tolstoy, Fiction, Classics		Leo Tolstoy, Aylmer Maude, Louise Maude	3.97	4046	283	It happened in the 'seventies in winter, on the day after St. Nicholas's Day. There was a fete in the parish and the innkeeper, Vasili Andreevich Brekhunov, a Second Guild merchant, being a church elder had to go to church, and had also to entertain his relatives and friends at home. But when the last of them had gone he at once began to prepare to drive over to see a neighboring proprietor about a grove which he had been bargaining over for a long time. He was now in a hurry to start, lest buyers from the town might forestall him in making a profitable purchase. . . . It was a moment that would ultimately cost someone his life, and for reasons that will surprise you. Listen carefully: read and learn.	108	1895	Vasili Andreevich Brekhunov		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50270.Master_and_Man
