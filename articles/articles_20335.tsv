SEER	Chronicles of Marithe #2	Patrick O'Scheen	4.58	26	14	On sale now at Amazon!! http://tinyurl.com/Seeratamazon I BELIEVE IN DRAGONS... The world of Marithe is back! The story of a young gamer named Xavier is woven into a plot of denial, betrayal and intrigue. He lives a double life running from those who would use him and searching for unconditional love. Demons, dragons and gypsies fill the game panorama, entangling Xavier in a disaster that could destroy the dragon race and profoundly change his worldâ€¦. Seer is a story that is independent of the series but adds to the whole.		August 29th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17976031-seer
