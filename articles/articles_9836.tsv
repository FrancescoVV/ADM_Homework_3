Prince Charming		Julie Garwood	4.06	12757	429	Only her beloved grandmother, Lady Esther, knew how devastated Taylor Stapleton had been when her fianc√© eloped with Taylor's cousin. Now dear Esther -- one of London's richest and most formidable matriarchs -- lies dying. But first she was going to help Taylor pull off the scam of the season. To escape becoming a ward of her unscrupulous uncle, Taylor would wed Lucas Ross, a rugged American rancher. Lady Esther's money would enable Ross to return home to Montana. Taylor had her own urgent reason to go to America...a precious legacy she hadn't revealed to Ross, for they had agreed to part ways once they reached Boston. But as her handsome new husband spoke of life in Montana, Taylor began planning a new future. To Taylor, the wide-open spaces of Montana sounded like paradise....	533	June 1st 1994	Taylor Stapleton, Lucas Ross	London, England (United Kingdom), Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Cincinnati, Ohio (United States), Redemption, Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107777.Prince_Charming
