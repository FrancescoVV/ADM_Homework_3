Spirit of the Rainforest		Mark Andrew Ritchie	4.36	414	55	The Yanamamo of the Amazon -- endangered children of nature or indigenous warmongers on the verge of destroying themselves? Now for the first time, a powerful Yanomamo shaman speaks for his people. Jungleman provides shocking, never-before-answered accounts of life-or-death battles among his people -- and perhaps even more disturbing among the spirits who fight for their souls. Brutally riveting, the story of Jungleman is an extraordinary and powerful document.	288	1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7292.Spirit_of_the_Rainforest
