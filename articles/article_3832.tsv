The Unwords		Non Nomen	3.63	258	39	"There is nothing more dangerous...than a character with no author." *This is the first edtition of The Unwords and it is now out of print. It was only available for a limited number of copies exclusively through the author's official website in 2012. The second edition was published in 2013 by Fearache Publishings and it's available worldwide through all major book retailers in paperback, hardcover, and available exclusively from Amazon in eBook format.* A nameless character. A faceless figure. A disturbing, thought-provoking journey through the facts of the world we live in that we often refuse to acknowledge. The Unwords take full advantage of their author's lack of identity and extreme levels of introspection as they unleash a full scale attack on all fronts of cultural and social decay. Education, religion, politics, language, relationships and common every day social activities are stripped down to their bare foundations and deconstructed through the eyes of a man who considers every act of deceit as an act of war against the people he loves. Poetic verse blends seamlessly with the arts in the form of full page illustrations to create a new, refreshing form of writing the author describes as “Graphic-verse.” Words are meant to be spoken. In a dishonest world, what remains unspoken can only be the truth. In a dishonest world... ...the pen is never mightier than the sword.	90	March 9th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18186565-the-unwords
