The Advanced Genius Theory: Are They Out of Their Minds or Ahead of Their Time?		Jason Hartley, Chuck Klosterman	3.54	382	49	Admittedly, the Advanced Theory had unpretentious beginnings; Jason Hartley and Britt Bergman invented the concept in 1990 at a Columbia, South Carolina, Pizza Hut. From those fast-food ruminations, however, grew a great hypothesis, perhaps best expressed by Chuck Klosterman, who wrote the foreword for this book; "When a genius does something that appears idiotic, it does not necessarily mean he suddenly sucks. What it might mean is that he's doing something you cannot understand, because he has Advanced beyond you." With that insight, you can take the great leap forward into this provocative and (let's admit it) extremely entertaining paperback original. Editor's recommendation.	288	April 28th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7284118-the-advanced-genius-theory
