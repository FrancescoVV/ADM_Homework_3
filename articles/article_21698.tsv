Losers	Jupiter Glazer	Matthue Roth	3.56	173	32	Do you... Listen to music that's not popular? Hang out with math geeks? Read poetry? Come from another country? Get embarrassed easily in overly social situations? Worry that everyone else is hooking up more than you? If you said 'yes' to any of these questions, there are people who think you're a loser. But not Jupiter Glazer. Jupiter, a Russian-born, outcast-befriending, sexually insecure brooder who listens to The Cure, is not about to lose out on high school. No, it's time for him to win. For once. This is his story.	192	October 1st 2008		Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3007030-losers
