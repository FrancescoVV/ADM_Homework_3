PineLight	PineLight #1	Jillian Peery	3.55	402	78	I loved him-that was my torment. And I was losing him all over again. Walls crumbled all around me. An undeniable force pulled at my core. I tried to fight it, I tried to deny it the power, but I was weak. I felt pain in my side, and I knew that this dark force was winning. My veins started to burn, and I screamed, but it didn't stop. Thrilling and seductive, PINELIGHT is a bittersweet love story submerged in a dark and beautiful world.	250	June 23rd 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12075543-pinelight
