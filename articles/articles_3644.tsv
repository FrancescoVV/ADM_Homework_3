Dragon Bound	Elder Races #1	Thea Harrison	4.10	43245	3069	Half-human and half-Wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the Wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their Dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful—and passionate—of the Elder Races. As the most feared and respected of the Wyrkind, Dragos Cuelebre cannot believe someone had the audacity to steal from him, much less succeed. And when he catches the thief, Dragos spares her life, claiming her as his own to further explore the desire they've ignited in each other. Pia knows she must repay Dragos for her trespass, but refuses to become his slave—although she cannot deny wanting him, body and soul.	312	January 1st 2011	Pia Giovanni, Dragos Cuelebre, Thistle "Tricks" Periwinkle, Tiago Black, Rune Ainissesthai, Quentin Caeravorn, Aryal, Keith Hollins, Graydon	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9637479-dragon-bound
