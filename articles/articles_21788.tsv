Aphrodite the Beauty	Goddess Girls #3	Joan Holub, Suzanne Williams	4.17	4254	187	Well-researched and true to the original myths, each volume in the Goddess Girls series addresses contemporary issues like friendships and relationships from a classically accurate—and entertaining—persepective. In Aphrodite the Beauty , Aphrodite, goddessgirl of love, must deal with jealousy after giving Athena a makeover. It doesn’t seem fair that the godboys pay more attention to her friend when Aphrodite is supposed to be destined for love! She also copes with a crush from an unlikely source—the nerdy Hephaestus (god of the smith)—and learns that love comes in many forms.	176	January 1st 2010	Aphrodite		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7199828-aphrodite-the-beauty
