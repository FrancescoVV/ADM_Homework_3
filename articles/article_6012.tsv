The Doll		Bolesław Prus, David J. Welsh, Stanisław Barańczak	3.84	8148	158	Warsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s is the setting for Prus’s grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering. The middle-aged hero, Wokulski, successful in business, is being destroyed by his obsessive love for a frigid society doll , Izabela. Embattled aristocrats, the new men of finance, Dickensian tradesmen, and the urban poor all come vividly to life on the vast, superbly detailed canvas against which Wokulski’s personal tragedy is played out. Unlike his Western European counterparts, Prus had to work under official censorship. In this edition, most of the smaller cuts made by the Tsarist censor have been restored, and one longer fragment is included as an appendix.	702	1890	Stanislaw Wokulski, Ignacy Rzecki, Izabela Lecka, Julian Ochocki, Ludwik Starski, Mrs. Stawska, Kazia Wasowska, Mr. Szlangbaum, Mr. Lecki, Baroness Krzeszowska, Suzin, Professor Geist, Baron Dalski, Ewelina Janocka, Felicja Janocka	Warsaw (Poland), Paris (France), Poland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/538871.The_Doll
