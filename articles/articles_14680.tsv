Playing The Odds	The MacGregors #1	Nora Roberts	4.00	6350	244	The cards were stacked, though neither of them knew it. Serena MacGregor's father left nothing to chance when he sent Justin Blade -- part Comanche and all gambler -- on a Caribbean cruise. His daughter was evading her responsibility to produce grandchildren by working as a blackjack dealer on the CELEBRATION. Odds were they'd meet. Serena's father had his hopes riding on what would happen when they did. Win, lose or draw, they were meant for each other, proving indisputably in this case that lucky in cards did not mean unlucky in love.	218	March 2nd 1985	Serena MacGregor, Justin Blade	Caribbean, Nassau (Bahamas), Hyannis Port, Massachusetts (United States), Atlantic City, New Jersey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490609.Playing_The_Odds
