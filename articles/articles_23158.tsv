The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: An Autohagiography		Aleister Crowley, Kenneth Grant, John Symonds	3.98	722	43	Aleister Crowley's autobiographical confessions are a fascinating record of his lifetime's journey into Strange regions of consciousness. A 'saint' of the 'Gnostic' church, Crowley subtitled his six-volume work 'an autohagiography'. He describes his initiation into magic, his world-wide travels and mistresses, his experiments with sex and drugs, and the philosophy of his famous Book of the Law which contains the gospel that Crowley proclaimed for all mankind: the Law of Thelema, or Do What Thou Wilt. Generations before his time, Crowley invoked sex, drugs, and Eastern philosophy in his perpetual and often bizarre search for self-realization. The Confessions , skillfully edited and annotated by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant, serves as the perfect introduction to Crowley's extraordinary life and thought.	960	January 1st 1969			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/440358.The_Confessions_of_Aleister_Crowley
