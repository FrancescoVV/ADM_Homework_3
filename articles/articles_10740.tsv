Cacoethes		Scott Michael Craig, Anissa M. Craig	4.38	8	6	Cacoethes (Kak-oh-ee-theez): Passionate urge or desire. This diverse and vivid collection of fictional short stories and poetry distinctly spans the fervent range of emotions experienced through passion and disappointment, illuminating the complexities of love and friendship. This collection, with many of the pieces broken up and found again throughout the book, is arranged in a certain order that follows the course of relationships. They mostly detail the emotional disarray and desire of men and women in, at, and against love.	208	April 14th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11203057-cacoethes
