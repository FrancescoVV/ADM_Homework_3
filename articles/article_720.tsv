Under the Dome		Stephen King	3.91	258840	14899	On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester’s Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener’s hand is severed as “the dome” comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when—or if—it will go away. Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens—town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician’s assistant at the hospital, a selectwoman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing—even murder—to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn’t just short. It’s running out. source: stephenking.com	1074	November 10th 2009	Dale Barbara, Julia Shumway, James Rennie, Junior Rennie, Eric "Rusty" Everett, Joseph "Scarecrow Joe" McClatchey, Brenda Perkins, Frank DeLesseps, Carter Thibodeau, Melvin Searles, Georgia Roux, Andy Sanders, Phil "The Chef" Bushey, Peter Randolph, United States Military, American Law Enforcement, Dale "Barbie" Barbara, James "Big Jim" Rennie, Bill Allnut, Sarah Allnut, Mabel Alston, Private Clint Ames, Tommy Anderson, Willow Anderson, Elsa Andrews, Aidan Patrick Appleton, Alice Rachel Appleton, Marty Arsenault, Donnie Baribeau, Chaz Bender, Kayla Bevins, Harriet Bigelow, Fernald "Fern" Bowie, Stewart Bowie, Joe Boxer, Clayton Brassey, Freeman Brown, Gina Buffalino, Michela Burpee, Romeo "Rommie" Burpee, Little Walter Bushey, Phil Bushey, Sammy Bushey, Billy Cale, Jack Cale, Ernie Calvert, Joanie Calvert, Lucien Calvert, Norrie Calvert, Ed Carty, Carrie Carver, Deanna Carver, Johnny Carver, Eddie Chalmers, Pamela Chen, Henrietta Clavard, John Clavard, Reverend Lester Coggins, Cindy Collins, Hanna Compton, Mrs. Connaught, Lauren Conree, Rance Conroy, Arletta Coombs, Anderson Cooper, Mary Lou Costas, Colonel James O.
