Seeking Crystal	Benedict-Savant #3	Joss Stirling	4.30	8356	617	Sparks will fly . . . Passion will ignite . . . Crystal Brook has always been the dud Savant in her family; paranormal powers just aren't her thing. Dropping out of school with a clutch of 'E' grades and no future, she lives in the shadow of her high-flying sister Diamond. On a trip to Denver, a chance encounter with the dashing Benedict brothers leaves Diamond head over heels in love and engaged to be married. Crystal, on the other hand, is unimpressed by their charms . . . in fact no boy can annoy her as much as Xav Benedict! Back in Venice, their families assemble for Diamond's wedding and a powerful enemy seizes the opportunity to attack. Crystal and Xav must join forces to save their loved-ones, unlocking a secret that, until now, has lain deeply buried . . .	258	January 1st 2012	Zed Benedict, Xavier "Xav" Benedict, Crystal Brook, Victor Benedict, Yves Benedict, Trace Benedict, Will Benedict, Phoenix Corrigan, Diamond Brook, Uriel Benedict	Venice (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13181901-seeking-crystal
