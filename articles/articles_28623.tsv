Scamps & Scoundrels	The Bad Guys #1	Eric Ugland	4.53	975	73	Just yesterday, Ben was a neckbeard weeb with a weakness for Red Bull and tendies. Today, he's got a new name, a new face, and a new body, and he's watching the Glaton City Guard fight a twenty-foot-tall ooze that crawled forth from the sewers. Tomorrow, he'll need to find a guild to join, save a girl, steal a crown, and most importantly, convince an innkeep about the gloriousness of chicken fingers.	446	August 15th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51938719-scamps-scoundrels
