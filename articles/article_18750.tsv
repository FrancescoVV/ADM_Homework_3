Passage of Destiny		Deborah L. Pearson	4.67	3	2	Melanie is one of a tight-knit group of girlfriends. She has been brought up by guardians and her origins are obscure. As she comes into her inheritance, and she and her cat and girlfriends move into the country, it soon becomes clear that all is not as it seems. Even her tomcat is not above suspicion, and the motley crew of boyfriends are, well ... something else. There are many unworldly experiences. Chick lit meets sci-fi and a lot of banter ensues, with strange twists in the plot and increasingly tortuous relationships emerging. Nothing is quite what it seems...	239	November 30th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27420590-passage-of-destiny
