Prague		Arthur Phillips	3.06	3714	489	A novel of startling scope and ambition, Prague depicts an intentionally lost Lost Generation as it follows five American expats who come to Budapest in the early 1990s to seek their fortune. They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague have it better, but still they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making.	400	2002		Hungary, Budapest (Hungary)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92488.Prague
