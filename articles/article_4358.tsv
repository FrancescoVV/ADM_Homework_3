We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves		Karen Joy Fowler	3.71	104318	11497	Meet the Cooke family. Our narrator is Rosemary Cooke. As a child, she never stopped talking; now that she's started college, she has wrapped herself in silence: the silence of intentional forgetting, of protective cover. Rosemary is now an only child, but she used to have a sister the same age as her, and an older brother. Both are now goneâ€”vanished from her life. Her once lively mother is a shell of her former self, her clever and imperious father now a distant, brooding man. And there was something unique about Rosemary's sister, Fern. You'll have to find out for yourself what it is that makes her unhappy family unlike any other.	310	May 30th 2013	Rosemary Cooke, Lowell Cooke, Fern	Bloomington, Indiana (United States), Davis, California (United States), Indianapolis, Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16176440-we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves
