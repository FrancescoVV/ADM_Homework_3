An Unexpected Pleasure	The Mad Morelands #4	Candace Camp	3.78	868	58	Had Theo Moreland, the Marquess of Raine, killed her brother? And had the treasure the two men sought in South America hastened his descent to an early grave? American journalist Megan Mulcahey had to know. But to find out, she needed to infiltrate the marquess's household. The new American governess intrigued Theo. Wanderlust had always plagued him--until Miss Mulcahey came to Broughton House to teach his young siblings. Now the strange pull of their immediate desire both troubled and excited him. He had seen her beauty once before, in a fever dream his memory could not escape. So why was this delicious vision now snooping around his mansion like a common thief?	424	July 28th 2005		England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36986124-an-unexpected-pleasure
