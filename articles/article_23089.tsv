The Cursed Fae King	The Cursed Kingdoms #2	A.K. Koonce, Rebecca Grey	4.11	628	56	Curses and crowns. That’s what it takes to make a crumbling kingdom. And the Northern Kingdom, it’ll soon be an empire of dusty remains if we can’t find our enemies hiding in plain sight. King Iri isn’t exactly my ally in all of this either. The prophecy and our marriage are all he’s focused on. It’s all he thinks he needs to keep his kingdom’s faith. Faith isn’t strong enough for what we need though. It won’t stop whoever is behind all this from spreading death across his lands like wildfire. We don’t need faith at all. We need revenge. NOTE: The Cruel Fae King is a fiery, panty melting enemies to lovers tale intended for readers 18 and over. Fans of Holly Black, Sarah J Maas, and all things sexy fae will fall in lusty hate with the Cursed Kingdoms Series.
