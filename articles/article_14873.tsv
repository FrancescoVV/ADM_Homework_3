A retired missionary, Barbara Batchelor, bears witness to the connections between many human dramas; the love between Daphne Manner and Hari Kumar; the desperate grief an old teacher feels for an India she cannot rescue; and the cruelty of Captain Ronald Merrick.	399	1971	Mohammed Ali Kasim, Count Bronowsky, Mabel Layton, Barbie Batchelor, Sarah Layton, Susan Layton, Mildred Layton, Ronald Merrick, Ahmed Kasim, Fenella Grace, Arthur Grace, Kevin Coley	India	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1000724.The_Towers_of_Silence
