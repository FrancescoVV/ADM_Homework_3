The Book of Atrix Wolfe		Patricia A. McKillip	3.98	3610	212	Twenty years ago, the powerful mage Atrix Wolfe unleashed an uncontrollable force that killed his beloved king. Now, the Queen of the Wood has offered him one last chance for redemption. She asks him to find her daughter, who vanished into the human world during the massacre he caused. No one has seen the princess-but deep in the kitchens of the Castle of Pelucir, there is a scullery maid who appeared out of nowhere one night long ago. She cannot speak and her eyes are full of sadness. But there are those who call her beautiful.	250	July 1st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77353.The_Book_of_Atrix_Wolfe
