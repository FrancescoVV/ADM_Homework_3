The Fire Eternal	The Last Dragon Chronicles #4	Chris d'Lacey	3.99	13145	372	A new magic is stirring beneath the surface of the Earth.... Five years have passed since David Rain, now a bestselling author, disappeared mysteriously in the Arctic. And slowly the ice is changing, bears are starving, dragons are rising, the souls of the Inuit dead are haunting the skies. The spirit Gaia, goddess of the Earth, is restless, aching to bring down her might upon these changes. But all living things may suffer if she does. As the weather grows wilder and the ice caps melt, all eyes turn from the north to David's daughter, Alexa. She is the key to stopping Gaia...but can one girl save the world from the forces of evil, or will she disappear like her father?	432	September 6th 2007	David Rain, Alexa Martindale, Tam Farrell, Suzanna Martindale, Elizabeth Pennykettle, Lucy Pennykettle		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1891296.The_Fire_Eternal
