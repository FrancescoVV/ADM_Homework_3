Isla and the Happily Ever After	Anna and the French Kiss #3	Stephanie Perkins	4.03	102748	11740	Love ignites in the City That Never Sleeps, but can it last? Hopeless romantic Isla has had a crush on introspective cartoonist Josh since their first year at the School of America in Paris. And after a chance encounter in Manhattan over the summer, romance might be closer than Isla imagined. But as they begin their senior year back in France, Isla and Josh are forced to confront the challenges every young couple must face, including family drama, uncertainty about their college futures, and the very real possibility of being apart. Featuring cameos from fan-favorites Anna, Étienne, Lola, and Cricket, this sweet and sexy story of true love—set against the stunning backdrops of New York City, Paris, and Barcelona—is a swoonworthy conclusion to Stephanie Perkins’s beloved series.	339	August 14th 2014	Joshua Wasserstein, Isla Martin, Kurt Donald Cobain Bacon, Hattie Martin	Paris (France), New York City, New York (United States), Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9627755-isla-and-the-happily-ever-after
