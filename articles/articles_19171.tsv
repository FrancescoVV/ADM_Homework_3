Falling Leaves		Colby West	3.50	4	1	The collection of writings and poems in "Falling Leaves" were the product of an unrelenting torturous relationship. A majority of the works feature a dreary atmosphere. Pain, suffering, depression, and fleeting moments of happiness are laid bare across the pages. Love is one of the strongest elements in the universe and can easily tear one asunder. I hope you enjoy the content as I feel everyone can relate to it in some shape, form, or fashion.					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43073123-falling-leaves
