Shame		Salman Rushdie	3.83	11105	553	The novel that set the stage for his modern classic, The Satanic Verses , Shame is Salman Rushdie’s phantasmagoric epic of an unnamed country that is “not quite Pakistan.” In this dazzling tale of an ongoing duel between the families of two men–one a celebrated wager of war, the other a debauched lover of pleasure–Rushdie brilliantly portrays a world caught between honor and humiliation–“shamelessness, shame: the roots of violence.” Shame is an astonishing story that grows more timely by the day.	287	September 8th 1983			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4831.Shame
