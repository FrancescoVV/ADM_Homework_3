Yes Man		Danny Wallace	4.08	9132	718	Recently single, Danny Wallace was falling into loneliness and isolation. When a stranger on a bus advises, "Say yes more," Wallace vows to say yes to every offer, invitation, challenge, and chance. In Yes Man, Wallace recounts his months-long commitment to complete openness with profound insight and humbling honesty. Saying yes takes Wallace into a new plane of existence: a place where money comes as easily as it goes, nodding a lot can lead to a long weekend overseas with new friends, and romance isn't as complicated as it seems. Yes eventually leads to the biggest question of all: "Do you, Danny Wallace, take this woman . . ." Yes Man is inspiring proof that a little willingness can take anyone to the most wonderful of places.	371	July 7th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87804.Yes_Man
