Revelations	Ruin #2	Lucian Bane	4.30	332	76	Ruin is a being sent to Earth to Judge and Execute. At least that's what he thinks. In this part of the journey, he must tear down Isadore's walls that are perverting his judgments. But with every bad judgment comes a price to be paid. And if Ruin doesn't get a hold of his powers, judgment is coming for them.	134	September 25th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23287353-revelations
