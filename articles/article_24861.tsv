Ellery's Duty	Thrown to the Lions #3	Kim Dare	3.70	1064	62	As a well respected dominant, Ellery has been watching the subs from the local leather bars disappear into the lions’ den for far too long, and he’s not convinced that everything is as fine as they all claim it is. He’s determined to find out what really happens in there. If the only way he can do that is to volunteer to be thrown to the lions himself, so be it. Kefir’s never worked out what the other lions find so interesting about the human sacrifices who visit their den, but this new man is unlike any other human he’s ever met, and Kefir’s captivated. Can the smallest lion in the pride claim a man like Ellery as his pet—is that even the way Kefir wants to think of his human mate? This book is best read in sequence as part of a series.	127	October 6th 2010	Marlin Ellery, Kefir Tinsley	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7704492-ellery-s-duty
