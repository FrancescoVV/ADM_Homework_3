The Goose Girl	The Books of Bayern #1	Shannon Hale	4.11	132844	10018	Mythopoeic Fantasy Award nominee for Children's Literature 2010 ( The Books of Bayern series). She was born with her eyes closed and a word on her tongue, a word she could not taste. Her name was Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, Crown Princess of Kildenree, and she spent the first years of her life listening to her auntâ€™s stories and learning the language of the birds, especially the swans. And when she was older, she watched as a colt was born, and she heard the first word on his tongue, his name, Falada. From the Grimm's fairy tale of the princess who became a goose girl before she could become queen, Shannon Hale has woven an incredible, original, and magical tale of a girl who must find her own unusual talents before she can lead the people she has made her own.	383	August 4th 2003	Razo, Geric, Enna, Princess Anidori-Kiladra, Finn, Selia		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179064.The_Goose_Girl
