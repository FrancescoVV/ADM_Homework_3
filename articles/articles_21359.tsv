A Little Lumpen Novelita		Roberto Bolaño, Natasha Wimmer	3.64	3239	363	The Final Bolaño Novella "Now I am a mother and a married woman, but not long ago I led a life of crime": so Bianca begins her tale of growing up the hard way in Rome. Orphaned overnight as a teenager - "our parents died in a car crash on their first vacation without us" - she drops out of school, gets a crappy job, and drifts into bad company. Her little brother brings home two petty criminals who need a place to stay. As the four of them share the family apartment and plot a strange crime, Bianca learns how low she can fall. Electric, tense with foreboding, and written in jagged, propulsive short chapters, A Little Lumpen Novelita delivers a surprising, fractured fable of seizing control of one's fate.	128	2002		Rome (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1895320.Una_novelita_lumpen
