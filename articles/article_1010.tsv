Awakened	House of Night #8	P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast	4.01	124134	3228	Exonerated by the Vampyre High Council and returned to her position of High Priestess at Tulsa’s House of Night, Neferet has sworn vengeance on Zoey. Dominion over her immortal consort Kalona is only one of the weapons she plans to use against Z. But Zoey has found sanctuary on the Isle of Skye and is being groomed by Queen Sgiach to take over for her there. Being Queen would be cool, wouldn’t it? Why should she return to Tulsa? After losing her human consort, Heath, she will never be the same – and her relationship with her super-hot-warrior, Stark, may never be the same either… And what about Stevie Rae and Rephaim? The Raven Mocker refuses to be used against Stevie Rae, but what choice does he have when no one in the entire world, including Zoey, would be okay with their relationship? Does he betray his father or his heart?	290	January 4th 2011	Zoey Redbird, Dragon, Nyx (House of Night), Erik Night, Stevie Rae Johnson, Neferet, Heath Luck, Aphrodite LaFont, Kalona, Sylvia Redbird, Erin Bates, Shaunee Cole, Damien Maslin, James Stark, Jack Twist, Queen Sgiach, Rephaim, Kramisha, Darius Langley	Isle of Skye, Scotland, Tulsa, Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8652190-awakened
