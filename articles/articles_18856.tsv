A Lineage of Grace	Lineage of Grace #1- 5	Francine Rivers	4.49	10526	708	In this compilation of the five books in the best-selling Lineage of Grace series by Francine Rivers, we meet the five women whom God chose—Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba, and Mary. Each was faced with extraordinary—even scandalous—challenges. Each took great personal risk to fulfill her calling. Each was destined to play a key role in the lineage of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the World.		2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95626.A_Lineage_of_Grace
