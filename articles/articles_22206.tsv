The Mind in the Making: The Relation of Intelligence to Social Reform - Complete English Version		James Harvey Robinson, Joseph Anthony Amoroso	3.81	118	8	With all the original work intact and completely translated in to English. This is one of the two books recommended by Napoleon Hill in his vastly popular "Law of Success" series. This is a ground breaking and brilliant book way ahead of its time. Napoleon Hill credits much of his theology on this specific title. Masterfully thought provoking and amazingly timely. This title pushes the boundaries of metaphysics, philosophy and human evolution even by today's standards.	278	January 1st 1921			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8257810-the-mind-in-the-making
