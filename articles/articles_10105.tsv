20th Century Boys, Band 01	20th Century Boys #1	Naoki Urasawa	4.37	5988	349	Mankind would not have made the new age, encountering the crisis at the end of the last century, that almost wiped them out... if it weren't for "them". In 1969, "they" who were still in their youth, created a symbol. In 1997, as the footsteps of the disaster slowly starts to show out, the symbol revives. This is the story about several boys, that save the world.	210	January 29th 2000	Friend, Kenji Endo, Kanna Endo, Choji Ochiai	Japan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1308213.20th_Century_Boys_Band_01
