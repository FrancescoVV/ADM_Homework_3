Absolute Y: The Last Man Vol. 2	Absolute Y: The Last Man #2	Brian K. Vaughan, Pia Guerra, Goran Sud≈æuka, Goran Parlov	4.36	143	10	Y: THE LAST MAN, winner of three Eisner Awards and one of the most critically acclaimed, best-selling comic book series of the last decade, is that rare example of a page-turner that is at once humorous, socially relevant and endlessly surprising. Written by Brian K. Vaughan (LOST, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD, EX MACHINA) and with art by Pia Guerra, this is the saga of Yorick Brown--the only human survivor of a planet-wide plague that instantly kills every mammal possessing a Y chromosome. Accompanied by a mysterious government agent, a brilliant young geneticist and his pet monkey, Ampersand, Yorick travels the world in search of his lost love and the answer to why he's the last man on Earth. In these stories, a Russian Soyuz capsule is coming down from the International Space Station carrying three passengers: one woman and two men. Could this be the end of Yorick's tenure as last living male? And then, as the Last Man on Earth and his companions continue to head west, the story takes a detour into the psychological. In the care of a fellow Culper Ring member, Yorick Brown is forced to confront his tremendous feelings of survivor guilt that lead him to constantly put his life in danger.
