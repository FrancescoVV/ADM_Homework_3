Sixteenth Summer	Sixteenth Summer #1	Michelle Dalton	3.88	9281	423	Anna is dreading another tourist-filled summer on Dune Island that follows the same routine: beach, ice cream, friends, repeat. That is, until she locks eyes with Will, the gorgeous and sweet guy visiting from New York. Soon, her summer is filled with flirtatious fun as Anna falls head over heels in love. But with every perfect afternoon, sweet kiss, and walk on the beach, Anna can't ignore that the days are quickly growing shorter, and Will has to leave at the end of August. Anna's never felt anything like this before, but when forever isn't even a possibility, one summer doesn't feel worth the promise of her heart breaking...	283	May 3rd 2011	Sam Turner, Will Cooper, Anna Patrick, Owen Cooper		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9091814-sixteenth-summer
