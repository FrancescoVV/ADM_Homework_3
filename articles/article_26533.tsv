Surviving the Fog	Surviving the Fog #1	Stan Morris	3.48	782	75	Have you ever been to summer camp? What would you do if almost all of the adults left “for a few hours” and did not return? What would you do if the cell phones stopped working and your parents never showed up to take you home? What would you do if you discovered that the Earth was covered by a mysterious, dangerous brown fog? How would you survive the winter? How would you get more to eat? This is what Mike, John, Desi and the other campers have to contend with in Surviving the Fog. Warning: sexual situations, cursing, brief violence	391	February 14th 2009		Sierra Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6361846-surviving-the-fog
