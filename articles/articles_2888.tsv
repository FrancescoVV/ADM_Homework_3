Frisk	George Miles Cycle #2	Dennis Cooper	3.44	3340	151	Cooper says, "I present the actual act of evil so it's visible and give it a bunch of facets so that you can actually look at it and experience it. You're seduced into dealing with it. ... So with Frisk , whatever pleasure you got out of making a picture in your mind based on ... those people being murdered, you take responsibility for it." In unsparingly confessional mode, Cooper leads the reader into a confrontation with what they get out of fantasized scenes of violence. A brilliant novel -- not a genre horror work but, rather, a critique of the power of genre.	144	1991		United States of America, Amsterdam (Netherlands)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51590.Frisk
