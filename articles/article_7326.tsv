Persuader	Jack Reacher #7	Lee Child	4.10	69479	2860	Jack Reacher. The ultimate loner. An elite ex-military cop who left the service years ago, he's moved from place to place...without family...without possessions...without commitments. And without fear. Which is good, because trouble--big, violent, complicated trouble--finds Reacher wherever he goes. And when trouble finds him, Reacher does not quit, not once...not ever. But some unfinished business has now found Reacher. And Reacher is a man who hates unfinished business. Ten years ago, a key investigation went sour and someone got away with murder. Now a chance encounter brings it all back. Now Reacher sees his one last shot. Some would call it vengeance. Some would call it redemption. Reacher would call it...justice.	496	April 1st 2003	Richard Beck, Elizabeth Beck, Zachary Beck, Susan Duffy, Paul "Paulie" Masserella, Francis Xavier Quinn, Terry Villanueva, John Chapman Duke, Jack Reacher	Portland, Maine (United States), Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455941.Persuader
