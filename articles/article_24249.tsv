The Death Catchers		Jennifer Anne Kogler	3.88	910	133	Dear Person-Holding-This, I guess you must've found my letter. Well, when you read it, keep in mind that passing Mrs. Tweedy's English class is hard enough. But when the fate of the world suddenly rests on your shoulders, it's difficult to focus on school. I wish I'd handled things better, but when I saw my first death-specter foretelling my best friend's death, I freaked out. Of course, I didn't exactly sign up to be a Hand of Fate or to protect King Arthur's Last Descendant. I know it isn't my fault Vivienne le Mort and Morgan le Faye decided to toy with fate all those centuries ago, but I do blame myself for what happened in Crabapple. Anyway, I hope you'll understand why writing my story was the only way I had even a small chance of saving the world and finishing my English assignment. Sincerely, Lizzy Mortimer Death Catcher	341	August 16th 2011	Lizzy Mortimer, Jodi Sanchez		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9583247-the-death-catchers
