Betrayals	Strange Angels #2	Lili St. Crow, Lilith Saintcrow	4.08	26106	864	She’s no angel... Poor Dru Anderson. Her parents are long gone, her best friend is a werewolf, and she’s just learned that the blood flowing through her veins isn’t entirely human. (So what else is new?) Now Dru is stuck at a secret New England Schola for other teens like her, and there’s a big problem—she’s the only girl in the place. A school full of cute boys wouldn’t be so bad, but Dru’s killer instinct says that one of them wants her dead. And with all eyes on her, discovering a traitor within the Order could mean a lot more than social suicide... Can Dru survive long enough to find out who has betrayed her trust—and maybe even her heart?	296	October 29th 2009	Dru Anderson, Christophe Reynard, Graves		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6371117-betrayals
