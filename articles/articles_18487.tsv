Her Hometown Redemption	Templeton Cove #5	Rachel Brimble	4.21	39	23	She's back to right her wrongs When Tanya Todd returns to Templeton Cove, she knows better than to expect a warm welcome. She burned a few bridges on her way out of town, and making amends won't be easy. First on her list is the man whose heart she carelessly shattered, Liam Browne. Seeing the successful criminal lawyer after all these years, Tanya is interested in more than just Liam's forgiveness. As they work together to bring the man who hurt her sister to justice, the attraction between them sizzles. Suddenly Tanya's second chance could include a future with Liam... if she can prove she's changed.		September 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26846509-her-hometown-redemption
