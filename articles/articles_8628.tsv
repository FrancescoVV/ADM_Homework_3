The History of Sexuality, Volume 3: The Care of the Self	The History of Sexuality #3	Michel Foucault, Robert Hurley	4.05	2164	69	Michel Foucault takes us into the first two centuries of our own era, into the Golden Age of Rome, to reveal a subtle but decisive break from the classical Greek vision of sexual pleasure. He skillfully explores the whole corpus of moral reflection among philosophers (Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) and physicians of the era, and uncovers an increasing mistrust of pleasure and growing anxiety over sexual activity and its consequences.	288	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1876.The_History_of_Sexuality_Volume_3
