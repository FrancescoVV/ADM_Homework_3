Winged Victory		V.M. Yeates	4.16	602	48	There is no bitter snarl nor self-pity in this classic novel about the air war of 1914-1918, based very largely on the author's experiences. Combat, loneliness, fatigue, fear, comradeship, women, excitement - all are built into a vigorous and authentic structure by one of the most valiant pilots of the then Royal Flying Corps.	456	1934			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53013.Winged_Victory
