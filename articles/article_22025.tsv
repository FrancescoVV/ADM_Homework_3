The Death of Hope	Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice #15	Jude Watson, Cliff Nielsen	3.84	1442	45	"I pledge myself to you, Tahl." "I pledge myself to you, Qui-Gon." With these words, two Jedi Knights acknowledged that their bond had grown beyond friendship and into love. Now Tahl has been abducted in a trap that Qui-Gon feels he should have foreseen. Consumed by dark visions, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan Kenobi must do everything in their power to get her back before it's too late. But that won't be easy in a land where nobody can be trusted . . . and everyone has something to hide.	152	October 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359823.The_Death_of_Hope
