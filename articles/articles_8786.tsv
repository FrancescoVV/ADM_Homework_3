Cronopios and Famas		Julio Cortázar, Paul Blackburn, Ελένη Χαρατσή	4.27	12944	658	"The Instruction Manual," the first chapter, is an absurd assortment of tasks and items dissected in an instruction-manual format. "Unusual Occupations," the second chapter, describes the obsessions and predilections of the narrator's family, including the lodging of a tiger-just one tiger- "for the sole purpose of seeing the mechanism at work in all its complexity." Finally, the "Cronopios and Famas" section delightfully characterizes, in the words of Carlos Fuentes, "those enemies of pomposity, academic rigor mortis and cardboard celebrity-a band of literary Marx Brothers."	162	1962		Argentina	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53423.Cronopios_and_Famas
