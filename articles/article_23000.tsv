You Can't Drive Your Car to Your Own Funeral		Ann Marie Hancock	4.59	22	11	You have reached a milestone in your life when the fire department is on standby as you blow out your birthday candles. If you have pondered going to heaven but without dying, this book is for you! As Father Ralph Pfau said, “You can’t be a good egg all your life. You either have to hatch or go bad.” Adventure into one courageous woman’s journey through later life as seen through her daughter’s eyes. Unique in every way, this woman operated completely without filter, remained in denial about her cancer diagnosis, and challenged the prognosis and thoughts of doctors, nurses, family, and friends. Written from the heart, Ann Marie Hancock shares her experiences in loving and caring for her mother through the heartaches and the joys and the times of laughter and sadness.	97	August 23rd 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44350409-you-can-t-drive-your-car-to-your-own-funeral
