Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat	Emmy #1	Lynne Jonell, Jonathan Bean	3.86	6494	564	Emmy was a good girl. At least she tried very hard to be good. She did her homework without being told. She ate all her vegetables, even the slimy ones. And she never talked back to her nanny, Miss Barmy, although it was almost impossible to keep quiet, some days. She really was a little too good. Which is why she liked to sit by the Rat. The Rat was not good at all . . . Hilarious, inventive, and irresistably rodent-friendly, Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat is a fantastic first novel from acclaimed picture book author Lynne Jonell.	346	August 7th 2007	Jim Addison		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381691.Emmy_and_the_Incredible_Shrinking_Rat
