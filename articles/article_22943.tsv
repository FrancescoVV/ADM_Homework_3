Patterson, Cat Ellington	5.00	9	5	Inspired by the feature film produced, written, and directed by Chicago filmmaker Joseph Strickland, The Making of Dual Mania: Filmmaking Chicago Style is a boldly personal account of what it takes to create, produce, and direct an independent feature film in current times.

Patterson and Cat Ellington, witnessing a fiery account of his own firsthand experiences through the menacing highs and lows of independent filmmaking in Chicago. With a fascinating foreword by Cat Ellington, The Making of Dual Mania: Filmmaking Chicago Style also features in-depth interviews with the filmmakers, detailed storyboards, behind the scenes photos, and the original motion picture screenplay.	230	September 3rd 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41710052-the-making-of-dual-mania
