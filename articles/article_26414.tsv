Blink and Caution		Tim Wynne-Jones	3.62	2158	404	Blink, man, what were you thinking? Sneaking into the hotel for a hot breakfast ? hot scraps of someone else's breakfast, really. Couldn?t you just feel that it was a wrong place/wrong time scenario? Even before you heard the banging and saw those dudes in suits jet it out of room 1616? Now you?re not only witness to a crime; you?re linked to it, thanks to the smartphone you were stupid enough to jack from the room.And then there's Caution. As in ?Caution: Contents Under Pressure.? She's also on the run, from a skeezy drug-dealer boyfriend and from a nightmare in her past that won?t let her go. The last thing she needs right now is some skinny-ass street punk spouting crazy conspiracy theories, but something about Blink tugs at her heart ? a heart she thought deserved not to feel.Charged with suspense and intrigue, this taut novel follows two compelling characters as they forge a fated, tender partnership.	345	March 8th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9264113-blink-and-caution
