Owens	4.27	3528	228	Alyssa Coldwell is bound for a destiny as an immortal witch, but she desperately wants the chance to live a normal, human life for as long as she can. She takes a vacation from magic, but magic refuses to leave her in peace. The fey world draws her back in more so than ever before. In the midst of all the mayhem, she meets Kane Ice. He's human, meaning he's forbidden fruit, for the fey world has laws against immortals and mortals. Worried her world will either get him killed or leave him with scars he'll never overcome, she keeps pushing him away. Kane refuses to be deterred though. He loves the girl he believes is meant for him. Dark secrets emerge all around the two of them, putting them both in the line of fire and destroying the beauty of their love. The question is, how strong is their love?	270	February 15th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20885104-blood-s-fury
