Angelo's Journey: A Border Collie's Quest for Home		Angelo Dirks, Leland Dirks	4.28	300	51	A Border Collie is brutally kidnapped. He escapes his captor and starts the long journey home, meeting a truck driver, a long-abused wife, a Marine, a cowboy and two grandmothers. Their lives will never be the same after meeting Angelo. Sometimes, all it takes to avert a disaster is the light touch of a canine paw. A warning to friends who've enjoyed my other books: The Marine, the cowboy, and the truckdriver in this book use some language that may not be suitable for younger readers. Also please consider another book by the same authors, Jimmy Mender and His Miracle Dog, just released for the Kindle and in paperback!.
