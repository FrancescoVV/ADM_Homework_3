Witness in Death	In Death #10	J.D. Robb, Susan Ericksen	4.30	29163	951	There was always an audience for murder. Opening night at New York's New Globe Theatre turns from stage scene to crime scene when the leading man is stabbed to death right on centre stage. Now Eve Dallas has a high profile celebrity homicide on her hands. Not only is she primary detective, she's also a witness - and when the press discovers that her husband, Roarke, owns the theatre, there's more media interest than either can handle. The only way out is to move fast. Question everyone - and everything. And in the meantime, try to tell the difference between the truth - and really good acting...	339	January 1st 2000	Eve Dallas, Roarke, Delia Peabody, Ryan Feeney, Charlotte Mira, Ian McNab, Commander Jack Whitney, Mavis Freestone, Nadine Furst, Lawrence Charles Summerset, Charles Monroe	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213975.Witness_in_Death
