Just Three Words	Soho Loft #2	Melissa Brayden	4.37	2589	220	Sometimes the one you want is the one you least suspect... Accountant Samantha Ennis craves order and structure. As the bookkeeper at the boutique advertising agency she owns with her three best friends, it’s her job to apply logic to the chaos. When one of those best friends, laid back Hunter Blair, moves in to share her loft apartment, Sam’s carefully organised world is thrown wildly askew. Hunter Blair’s been the coolest one in the room since elementary school. Until recently, her biggest worry in the world was which of the girls in her cell phone to call on a Saturday night. But it’s not long before Samantha sparks a fire in Hunter that has her questioning her old habits and longing for new ones. Isn’t it a bad idea to fall for one of your best friends? Samantha and Hunter are about to find out.	271	April 19th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22750233-just-three-words
