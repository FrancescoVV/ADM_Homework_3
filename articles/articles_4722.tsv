Sabbath's Theater		Philip Roth	3.85	8907	687	Winner of the National Book Award for Fiction Sabbath's Theater is a comic creation of epic proportions, and Mickey Sabbath is its gargantuan hero. At sixty-four Sabbath is still defiantly antagonistic and exceedingly libidinous; sex is an obsession and a principle, an instrument of perpetual misrule in his daily existence. But after the death of his long-time mistress - an erotic free spirit whose great taste for the impermissible matches his own - Sabbath embarks on a turbulent journey into his past. Bereft and grieving, tormented by the ghosts of those who loved and hated him, he contrives a succession of farcical disasters that take him to the brink of madness and extinction.	451	1995	Mickey Sabbath, Norman Cowan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11654.Sabbath_s_Theater
