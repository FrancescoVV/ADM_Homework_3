The River of Adventure	Adventure #8	Enid Blyton	4.08	2305	62	A river cruise through ancient desert lands will be an adventure in itself, think Philip, Dinah, Lucy-Ann, and Jack. An adventure it certainly is, especially when Bill disappears and the children, along with Kiki the parrot, are trapped beneath a forgotten temple where no one has set foot for 7,000 years.	160	January 1st 1955	Lucy-Ann Trent, Kiki the Parrot, Dinah Mannering, Jack Trent, Philip Mannering	Syria	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/955942.The_River_of_Adventure
