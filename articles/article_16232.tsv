The Songs and Sonets of John Donne		John Donne, Theodore Redpath	4.17	294	10	There is perhaps no superior edition of Donne's Songs and Sonets than Theodore Redpath's wonderful annotated volume. Out of print for a decade, the book is reprinted here in its second, revised edition. The book's twofold origin is evident on every page of Redpath's limpid commentary: it arises partly out of a life of scholarship and partly from Redpath's experiences and concerns as a teacher. The volume contains notes "on every point likely to cause difficulty to a reader of average intelligence."	374	1633			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6356101-the-songs-and-sonets-of-john-donne
