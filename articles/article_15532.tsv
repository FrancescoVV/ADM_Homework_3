The Ugly Little Boy		Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg	3.88	3005	140	Asimov wrote the short story "The Ugly Little Boy" in 1958. But there is much more to the story of the little Neanderthal boy plucked out of time and transferred to the 21st century. Now, Robert Silverberg--in this second collaboration with Asimov--has made this sf classic into an engrossing novel-length tale.	387	1991	Edith Fellowes, Timmie, Gerald Hoskins, Silver Cloud, She Who Knows		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195450.The_Ugly_Little_Boy
