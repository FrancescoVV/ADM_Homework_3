Knight's Mistress	All or Nothing #1	C.C. Gibbs	3.92	7162	572	Katherine Hart is thrilled to be recruited by Knight Enterprises, the most prestigious venture-capital company in the world. That is, until she makes the acquaintance of the company’s infamous CEO, Dominic Knight . At thirty-two, Dominic is a self-made billionaire with a fearsome ambition and a temper to match. He is also impossibly attractive and dangerously charming when he wants to be. To Kate, Dominic seems like the perfect predator, and she resolves to be cautious despite the obvious chemistry between them, telling herself she can always leave if Dominic grows too demanding. What she doesn’t know is that the decision isn’t hers to make… Dominic Knight has found a new plaything, and Mr. Knight always gets what he wants.	364	December 6th 2012	Katherine "Kate" Hart, Dominic "Nick" Knight	Amsterdam (Netherlands), Hong Kong	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17054826-knight-s-mistress
