Vox		Christina Dalcher	3.55	53545	8833	Silence can be deafening . Jean McClellan spends her time in almost complete silence, limited to just one hundred words a day. Any more, and a thousand volts of electricity will course through her veins. Now the new government is in power, everything has changed. But only if you’re a woman . Almost overnight, bank accounts are frozen, passports are taken away and seventy million women lose their jobs. Even more terrifyingly, young girls are no longer taught to read or write. For herself, her daughter, and for every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice. This is only the beginning… Perfect for fans of The Handmaid’s Tale , don’t miss the thrilling debut that everyone is talking about!	352	August 21st 2018	Jean McClellan, Patrick McClellan, Sonia McClellan, Steven McClellan, Jackie Juarez, Carl Corbin, Lorenzo Rossi	Georgetown, Washington, D.C.
