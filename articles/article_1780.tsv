Prey		Michael Crichton	3.76	165529	3430	In the Nevada desert, an experiment has gone horribly wrong. A cloud of nanoparticles -- micro-robots -- has escaped from the laboratory. This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive. It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour. Every attempt to destroy it has failed. And we are the prey.	507	November 25th 2002	Jack Forman, Julia Forman	Nevada desert (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83763.Prey
