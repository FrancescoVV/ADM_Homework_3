A Tale Dark & Grimm	A Tale Dark & Grimm #1	Adam Gidwitz	4.07	22123	3470	In this mischievous and utterly original debut, Hansel and Gretel walk out of their own story and into eight other classic Grimm-inspired tales. As readers follow the siblings through a forest brimming with menacing foes, they learn the true story behind (and beyond) the bread crumbs, edible houses, and outwitted witches. Fairy tales have never been more irreverent or subversive as Hansel and Gretel learn to take charge of their destinies and become the clever architects of their own happily ever after.	256	October 28th 2010	Gretel, Hansel		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7825557-a-tale-dark-grimm
