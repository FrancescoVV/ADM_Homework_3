He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.	388	March 1st 2005	Peter Wiggin, "Bean"		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8647.Shadow_of_the_Giant
