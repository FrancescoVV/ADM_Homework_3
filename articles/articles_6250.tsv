Consumed	Consumed #1	Skyla Madi	4.08	14700	817	I knew Seth Marc was trouble the moment I laid eyes on him. His arrestive presence rippled through me and I felt his chaos deep in my bones as our gazes met across the expanse of my father's gym. The alluring fighter wasn't my type with his athletic torso, long, ropy arms, and powerful fists built to destroy men weaker than him, but every fiber in my being was fixated on him. I craved him. And although I knew he was the kind of guy who left a trail of shattered hearts in his wake, I wanted him. I needed him. I had to have him. For the first time in my life, I decided to take a walk on the wild side, consequences be damned.	422	September 11th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17907550-consumed
