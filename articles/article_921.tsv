Beastly	Kendra Chronicles #1	Alex Flinn	3.83	170483	9068	I am a beast. A beast. Not quite wolf or bear, gorilla or dog but a horrible new creature who walks upright—a creature with fangs and claws and hair springing from every pore. I am a monster. You think I'm talking fairy tales? No way. The place is New York City. The time is now. It's no deformity, no disease. And I'll stay this way forever—ruined—unless I can break the spell. Yes, the spell, the one the witch in my English class cast on me. Why did she turn me into a beast who hides by day and prowls by night? I'll tell you. I'll tell you how I used to be Kyle Kingsbury, the guy you wished you were, with money, perfect looks, and the perfect life. And then, I'll tell you how I became perfectly . . . beastly.	304	October 2nd 2007	Magda, Kyle Kingsbury, Will Fratalli, Linda "Lindy" Owens, Kendra Hilferty, Rob Kingsbury, Mr. Anderson	New York State (United States), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544891.Beastly
