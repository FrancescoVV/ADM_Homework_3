The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle	ねじまき鳥クロニクル #1-3	Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin	4.16	219449	14223	Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II. In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria. Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon. Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet, The Birdcatcher. This translation by Jay Rubin is in collaboration with the author.	607	April 12th 1994	Toru Okada, Kumiko Okada, Noboru Wataya, Malta Kano, May Kasahara, Creta Kano, Tokutaro Mamiya, Nutmeg Akasaka, Cinnamon Akasaka, Boris Gromov, Ushikawa		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11275.The_Wind_Up_Bird_Chronicle
