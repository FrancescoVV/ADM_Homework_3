Things Never To Call Your Wife: Porky, Meatloaf, Big Bum		Carhamel D. Chesecake	5.00	2	1	This will probably be the most quirky, fun, and entertaining book you have read. It is filled with humor, surprises, true life stories, secrets, illustrations, inspirational stories, pictures, and many more SURPRISES! There are so many problems and troubles in the world. You can laugh, be entertained, and feel as if you have escaped from these stresses (even for just a few minutes) by reading and participating in this new book. Take your time reading because you will be able to give your own responses, opinions, and comments. Or you could share your own personal experiences you have had in life. You could also write them in the book or type them on the website. Some of the stories will make you laugh, some will make you think about life, and some will make you want to bang your head against a wall (just joking). If you participate by responding to the questions, you will find this journey much more personally rewarding. Remember, this is not just a book - this is an unusual and fun experience. Soooooooo, hang on to your chair and let the journey begin!	424	2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40604020-things-never-to-call-your-wife
