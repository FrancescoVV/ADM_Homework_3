Reforming a Rake	With This Ring #1	Suzanne Enoch	3.91	3585	186	Lessons In Love A governess must never be alone with a man. Her reputation mustn't have even a hint of scandal. She must never reveal personal emotions. No matter how strong the provocation by her employer. A governess never questions her employer's commands. Even when he's tempting her to forsake respectability for desire? She must never, ever, fall in love with someone above her station. Especially a rake—no matter how devastating his kisses may be. Alexandra Gallant is a governess extraordinaire—and if it weren't for that unfortunate incident at her last position, she wouldn't now be forced into the employ of Lucien Balfour, the most notorious rake in London. Though the sinfully attractive earl hired her to teach his young cousin, his seductive whispers and toe-curling kisses suggest he has something far less respectable in mind...and that will never happen. For although Lucien seems determined to teach her about pleasure, she has a few lessons to teach him about love!	374	March 2000	Alexandra Gallant, Lucien Balfour		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535754.Reforming_a_Rake
