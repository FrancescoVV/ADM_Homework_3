Rule No. 5: No Sex on the Bus: Confessions of a Tour Leader		Brian Thacker	3.88	419	32	Brian Thacker confesses all as he reveals the best (and worst) of 20 trips as a tour leader around Europe. He tells how he fed passengers horse meat spag bol, hamburgers made from breakfast cereal and roosters' testicles; how he left a passenger standing by the side of a motorway in France for 3 hours in his underwear clutching a purple toothbrush and how, along the way, he lost his driver, his cook, his bus, ten brightly coloured canal bikes, a large church and eventually his patience.	300	June 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/439594.Rule_No_5
