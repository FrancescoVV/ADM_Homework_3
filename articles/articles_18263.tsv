Enslavement	One Bright Future #1	Melinda Marshall Friesen	4.34	64	26	"One world. One currency. One bright future." That's the promise made by OneEarth Bank after a global economic collapse--but only for those who accept the insertion of a commerce chip. When Rielle's parents refuse to comply, government officials tear her family apart. As punishment for her parent's crimes, Rielle is forced into a Community Service Contract--a legalized form of slavery--and sold to a wealthy, abusive banker. The Banker's secrets hold the key to Rielle's freedom, but will she risk prison or even death to escape and search for her family?	228	October 31st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23585287-enslavement
