My Merlin Awakening	My Merlin Trilogy #2	Priya Ardis	3.85	988	92	If you haven't broken the rules, have you really lived? Excalibur has been pulled from the stone, but what does it mean? Arriane (aka Ryan ) DuLac's got bigger problems—as student president, she's got to put on the Prom. While the Wizard Council debates their next move, she leaves the craziness behind and heads home. But she can’t hide forever. Sooner than she’d like Merlin (aka Matt) has her chasing mermaids on the trail of the Fisher King in Greece. The wounded King, defeated by Merlin’s brother, Vane , in the past holds the key to save the future. On the journey, Ryan begins to realize the friends she thought she knew, she may not know at all. At a time of shifting alliances, she must decide whose side she’s on—the brother who struggles to do right or the brother who dares to break the rules? And Ryan must decide who she is—a regular or a champion? One wrong decision and her family falls apart. One wrong decision and the world falls apart. No pressure.	340	May 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48585577-my-merlin-awakening
