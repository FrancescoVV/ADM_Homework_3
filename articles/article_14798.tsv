Emma on Thin Icing	Cupcake Diaries #3	Coco Simon, Elizabeth Doyle Carey	4.26	1576	77	When Mia asks the girls in the club to be junior bridesmaids in her mother's wedding, everyone is superexcited about the idea...especially when they find the perfect dress for the occasion! It's Emma's dream dress, except it's a little more than she expected. And with her mom now out of a job (she's been put on furlough at the library) there's not a lot of room at the Taylor's house for extras. But not wanting to disappoint her friends, Emma decides to take on a few more jobs and chores around the house to help cover the cost. Between babysitting her bratty brother, a dog-walking business, flute practice, the Cupcake Club - and oh yeah, being a typical tween girl - Emma may have bitten off more than she can chew. Can she handle it all?	160	August 30th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10269888-emma-on-thin-icing
