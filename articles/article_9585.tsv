Fatal Voyage	Temperance Brennan #4	Kathy Reichs	4.04	46259	1154	Investigating a plane crash in the Smoky Mountains in North Carolina, forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan discovers in a most disturbing way that the evidence doesn't add up. Tripping over a coyote-chewed leg at the crash scene, she performs a little mental arithmetic and realizes that this victim wasn't on the plane. Once again, Brennan's high-tech DMORT snaps into action faster than you can say "Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team." The author of Death du Jour serves up another exquisite meal.	448	2001	Temperance Brennan, Andrew Ryan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128759.Fatal_Voyage
