From Scratch	Love Lines #2.5	Diana Nixon	4.38	24	10	Our lives are a cascade of events that pass faster than we would like them to. Time changes everything. Our habits, our views, our circle of friends. But there is one thing that remains the same over the years. Our memories. Through them we cherish the most unforgettable moments of our history. And they also retain some things that can't be forgotten…. But one day you realize that yesterday should be left in the past. Because tomorrow your new life begins, and you go back to the drawing board. A love story of Evan Murray and Tara Mackenzie. A story that should last forever…. But no one knows when forever ends….		2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14287460-from-scratch
