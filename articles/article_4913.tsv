Or at least sort of. The authorities are closing in, but when a surprise blizzard hits, the Heffley family is trapped indoors. Greg knows that when the snow melts he’s going to have to face the music, but could any punishment be worse than being stuck inside with your family for the holidays?	224	2010	Greg Heffley, Rodrick Heffley, Manny Heffley, Rowley		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11254250-cabin-fever
