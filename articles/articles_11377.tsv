Words in Deep Blue		Cath Crowley, Кэт Кроули	4.07	23489	4284	This is a love story. It's the story of Howling Books, where readers write letters to strangers, to lovers, to poets. It's the story of Henry Jones and Rachel Sweetie. They were best friends once, before Rachel moved to the sea. Now, she's back, working at the bookstore, grieving for her brother Cal and looking for the future in the books people love, and the words they leave behind.	273	August 30th 2016	George Jones, Henry Jones, Michael Jones, Rachel Sweetie, Cal Sweetie, Martin Charles Gamble, Sophia Jones	Melbourne, Victoria (Australia), Australia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31952703-words-in-deep-blue
