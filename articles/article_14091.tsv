But the fearless firefighter with the awesome wilderness skills is the only one who can take her where she needs to go. It’s a gamble—tracking down her endangered sister while keeping Sam and their undeniable attraction at arm’s length. Not easy when they’re trekking into a remote corner of the Rockies, where she’s got to trust her former lover with her life. Despite their past, Sam never could refuse a damsel in distress, especially one who has haunted his dreams for years. He’ll help find her sister and get Dianna out of his system once and for all. But soon it’s hard to tell whether the greatest threat is from the rushing rapids, the deadly enemy on their trail, or the passion that’s sending them straight into the line of fire….	335	October 27th 2009	Dianna Kelley, Sam MacKenzie	Vail, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6382225-hot-as-sin
