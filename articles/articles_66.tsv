The Stand		Stephen King, Bernie Wrightson	4.34	619329	20830	This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death. And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen.	1153	October 3rd 1978	Stuart Redman, Glenn Bateman, Nick Andros, Tom Cullen, Nadine Cross, Fran Goldsmith, Harold Lauder, Joe/Leo Rockway, Mother Abigail Freemantle, Randall Flagg, Trashcan Man, The Anti-Christ, Judge Farris, Larry Underwood, General William Starkey, Major Len Creighton, The Rat Man, Captain Trips, Charles D.
