Asterix in Britain	Astérix #8	René Goscinny, Albert Uderzo	4.28	8936	226	One little ancient British village still holds out against the Roman invaders. Asterix and Obelix are invited to help. They must face fog, rain, warm beer and boiled boar with mint sauce, but they soon have Governor Encyclopaedicus Britannicus's Romans declining and falling. Until a wild race for a barrel of magic potion lands them in the drink. It's not quite cricket - how about a nice cup of hot water, though? Or even the first ever tea-party?	48	September 9th 1965	Asterix, Obelix, Panoramix, Abraracourcix	Britain, Armorica, Brittany (France), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71299.Asterix_in_Britain
