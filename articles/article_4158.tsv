A Dangerous Fortune		Ken Follett	4.07	35624	1733	In 1866, tragedy strikes at the exclusive Windfield School. A young student drowns in a mysterious accident involving a small circle of boys. The drowning and its aftermath initiates a spiraling circle of treachery that will span three decades and entwine many loves... From the exclusive men's club and brothels that cater to every dark desire of London's upper classes to the dazzling ballrooms and mahogany-paneled suites of the manipulators of the world's wealth, Ken Follett conjures up a stunning array of contrasts. This breathtaking novel portrays a family splintered by lust, bound by a shared legacy... men and women swept toward a perilous climax where greed, fed by the shocking truth of a boy's death, must be stopped, or not just one man's dreams, but those of a nation, will die...	596	September 24th 1993	Maisie, Augusta Pilaster, Hugh Pilaster, Micky Miranda, Edward Pilaster	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/825508.A_Dangerous_Fortune
