The Book of Merlyn	The Once and Future King #5	T.H. White	3.95	8518	373	This magical account of King Arthur's last night on earth spent weeks on the New York Times best-seller list following its publication in 1977. Even in addressing the profound issues of war and peace, The Book of Merlyn retains the life and sparkle for which White is known. The tale brings Arthur full circle, an ending, White wrote, that "will turn my completed epic into a perfect fruit, 'rounded off and bright and done.'"	160	1977	Merlin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Mordred, Queen Guinevere, King Arthur		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48044.The_Book_of_Merlyn
