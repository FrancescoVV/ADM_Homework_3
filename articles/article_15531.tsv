There, among the lacrosse sticks, they stumble upon the body of the unpopular games mistress – shot through the heart from point blank range. The school is thrown into chaos when the ‘cat’ strikes again. Unfortunately, schoolgirl Julia Upjohn knows too much. In particular, she knows that without Hercule Poirot’s help, she will be the next victim…	352	November 2nd 1959	Julia Upjohn, Miss Chadwick, Hercule Poirot, Jennifer Sutcliffe, Princess Shaista, Mrs. Upjohn, Mrs. Sutcliffe, Honoria Bulstrode, Eleanor Vansittart, Grace Springer, Angele Blanche, Eileen Rich, Ann Shapland, Alì Yusuf, Bob Rawlinson, Adam Goodman, Kelsey, Mr. Robinson, Colonel Pikeaway	United Kingdom, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16342.Cat_Among_the_Pigeons
