...stepping lightly through times of great change: hints and holograms for your well-being		Diane de Simone	4.38	8	5	This is a very short, fun, interactive book. HEADPHONES are recommended. Music is in all the right places... Scientists are now revealing the underlying principles of the universe and of OUR EXISTENCE. They are now in agreement. If you feel even a bit of the chaos happening around you, know it's because we are being asked to EVOLVE, to shift, to embrace a far larger view of ourselves and our place in the universe. At our core, we are more powerful and peaceful than we know. We must go inward and Onward. To a higher consciousness. A new earth.	27	September 9th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41748779-stepping-lightly-through-times-of-great-change
