Ape and Essence		Aldous Huxley	3.77	4830	313	In February 2108, the New Zealand Rediscovery Expedition reaches California at last. It is over a century since the world was devastated by nuclear war, but the blight of radioactivity and disease still gnaws away at the survivors. The expedition expects to find physical destruction but they are quite unprepared for the moral degradation they meet. Ape and Essence is Huxley's vision of the ruin of humanity, told with all his knowledge and imaginative genius.	222	August 1948		Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30561.Ape_and_Essence
