Erotism: Death and Sensuality		Georges Bataille, Mary Dalwood	4.08	2447	113	Taboo and sacrifice, transgression and language, death and sensuality—Georges Bataille pursues these themes with an original, often startling perspective. He challenges any single discourse on the erotic. The scope of his inquiry ranges from Emily Bronte to Sade, from St. Therese to Claude Levi-Strauss, and Dr. Kinsey; and the subjects he covers include prostitution, mythical ecstasy, cruelty, and organized war. Investigating desire prior to and extending beyond the realm of sexuality, he argues that eroticism is "a psychological quest not alien to death." " . . . one of the most original and unsettling of those thinkers who, in the wake of Sade and Nietzsche, have confronted the possibility of thought in a world that has lost its myth of transcendence." — Peter Brooks, New York Times Book Review "Bataille is one of the most important writers of the century." — Michel Foucault "[An] urgent, thrusting book about love, sex, death and spirituality by Georges Bataille." — Mark Price, Philosophy Now	288	1957			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37530.Erotism
