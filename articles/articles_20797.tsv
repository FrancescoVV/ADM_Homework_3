The RN Diaries	The Naughty Nurse #1	Dolyn Keys	4.49	78	48	Vanity, Nadia, and Kensington—three nurses who have a penchant for high fashion, late nights, and using their feminine power over men—all work the night shift at Ellerton Memorial Hospital. But when they aren't saving lives, they're out on the town exploring their wild sides. After numerous random hookups, the three women realize they want more excitement and arousal. When Vanity is fed up with being a nurse, she seeks other career options—hosting adult parties, and Nadia and Kensington are invited. The nights are filled with intrigue, secrets, passion . . . and then some. Nadia's sexual appetite is satiated, but her relationship is threatened by the shadows of her past. Kensington struggles to balance her work and personal life, while trying to figure out whether she wants to be the teaser or the teased. Searching for a quick sexcapade has now become a bit more complicated, as Vanity, Nadia, and Kensington begin to question their views of life, men, and what they want out of a relationship.	294	July 17th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25897988-the-rn-diaries
