The Miraculous Day of Amalia GÃ³mez		John Rechy	3.72	211	16	In The Miraculous Day of Amalia Gomez, Amalia Gomez thinks she sees a large silver cross in the sky. A miraculous sign, perhaps, but one the down-to-earth Amalia does not trust. Through Amalia, we take a vivid and moving tour of the "other Hollywood," populated by working-class Mexican Americans, as John Rechy blends tough realism with religious and cultural fables to take us into the life of a Chicano family in L.A. Epic in scope and vision, The Miraculous Day of Amalia Gomez is classic Rechy.	224	1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109715.The_Miraculous_Day_of_Amalia_G_mez
