This Side of the Grave	Night Huntress #5	Jeaniene Frost	4.27	58193	2462	Danger waits on both sides of the grave. Half-vampire Cat Crawfield and her vampire husband Bones have fought for their lives, as well as for their relationship. But just when they've triumphed over the latest battle, Cat's new and unexpected abilities threaten to upset a long-standing balance . . . With the mysterious disappearance of vampires, rumors abound that a species war is brewing. A zealot is inciting tensions between the vampires and ghouls, and if these two powerful groups clash, innocent mortals could become collateral damage. Now Cat and Bones are forced to seek help from a dangerous "ally"â€”the ghoul queen of New Orleans herself. But the price of her assistance may prove more treacherous than even the threat of a supernatural war . . . to say nothing of the repercussions Cat never imagined.	357	February 1st 2011	Denise MacGregor, Bones (Night Huntress series), Catherine Crawfield-Russell, Spade (Night Huntress series), Mencheres, Tate Bradley, Don Williams, Vlad Tepesh, Kira Graceling	Tennessee (United States), Ohio (United States), Memphis, Tennessee (United States), French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana (United States) Blue Ridge Mountains (United States) Garland, Texas (United States), French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Blue Ridge Mountains (United States), Garland, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6871617-this-side-of-the-grave
