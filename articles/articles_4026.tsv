Lilith		George MacDonald	3.89	5610	533	Lilith is a story concerning the nature of life, death, and salvation. After he followed the old man through the mirror, nothing in his life was ever right again. It was a special mirror and the man he followed was a special man - a man who led him to the things that underlie the fate of all creation. Lilith is considered among the darkest of MacDonald's works, and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the nature of life, death, and salvation. In the story, MacDonald mentions a cosmic sleep that heals tortured souls, preceding the salvation of all.	264	November 27th 1895	Mr. Vane, Mr. Raven, Sir Ralph, Sir Upward		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/268187.Lilith
