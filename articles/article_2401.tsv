Bloodrose	Nightshade #3	Andrea Cremer	4.06	27332	2295	Calla has always welcomed war. But now that the final battle is upon her, there's more at stake than fighting. There's saving Ren, even if it incurs Shay's wrath. There's keeping Ansel safe, even if he's been branded a traitor. There's proving herself as the pack's alpha, facing unnamable horrors, and ridding the world of the Keepers' magic once and for all. And then there's deciding what to do when the war ends. If Calla makes it out alive, that is. In this remarkable final installment of the Nightshade trilogy, international bestselling author Andrea Cremer crafts a dynamic novel with twists and turns that will keep you breathless until its final pages.	406	January 3rd 2012	Calla Tor, Ren Laroche, Ansel Tor, Seamus Doran		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8130839-bloodrose
