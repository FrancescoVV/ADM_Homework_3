Psycho	Psycho #1	Robert Bloch	4.10	55255	2447	It was a dark and stormy night when Mary Crane glimpsed the unlit neon sign announcing the vacancy at the Bates motel. Exhausted, lost, and at the end of her rope, she was eager for a hot shower and a bed for the night. Her room was musty but clean and the plumbing worked. Norman Bates, the manager, seemed nice, if a little odd.	208	April 10th 1959	Norman Bates, Mary Crane, Lila Crane, Sam Loomis	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156427.Psycho
