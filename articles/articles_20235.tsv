The Angel Riots		Ibi Kaslik	3.61	129	9	Acclaimed author Ibi Kaslik takes readers backstage with up-and-coming Montreal band The Angel Riots on their American tour. The band's story unfolds through the eyes of Jim, a small-town violin prodigy who struggles with her past as well as her present; and Rize, an emotionally charged trombone player who is stuck playing sidekick to his best friend, charismatic lead singer Jules. As the band's popularity mounts, the pressures of road-life and success begin to complicate relationships and The Angel Riots' chaotic world threatens to implode. Dark and dazzling, this novel will firmly establish Kaslik's reputation as a young literary talent.	288	March 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3131270-the-angel-riots
