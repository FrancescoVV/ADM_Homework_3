Lost Illusions	La Comédie Humaine #38	Honoré de Balzac, Ellen Marriage, George Saintsbury	4.17	8574	371	Handsome would-be poet Lucien Chardon is poor and naive, but highly ambitious. Failing to make his name in his dull provincial hometown, he is taken up by a patroness, the captivating married woman Madame de Bargeton, and prepares to forge his way in the glamorous beau monde of Paris. But Lucien has entered a world far more dangerous than he realized, as Madame de Bargeton's reputation becomes compromised and the fickle, venomous denizens of the courts and salons conspire to keep him out of their ranks. Lucien eventually learns that, wherever he goes, talent counts for nothing in comparison to money, intrigue and unscrupulousness. Lost Illusions is one of the greatest novels in the rich procession of the Comedie humaine, Balzac's panoramic social and moral history of his times.	656	1837	Eugène de Rastignac, Vautrin, Henri de Marsay, Horace Bianchon, Lucien Chardon de Rubempré, David Séchard, Ève Séchard, Marie Louise Anaïs de Bargeton, Daniel d'Arthez, Armand de Montriveau, Michel Chrestien, Coralie, Raoul Nathan, Étienne Lousteau, Melchior de Canalis, Émile Blondet, Andoche Finot, Félix de Vandenesse, Felicité des Touches, Camusot, Joseph Bridau, Florine (Sophie Grignault), Diane de Maufrigneuse		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25932.Lost_Illusions
