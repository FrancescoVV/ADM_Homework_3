Code Revelation	The Emporion Chronicles #1	Boris Sanders	4.03	32	19	Introverted computer scientist Maximilian Gutenberg had no intention of acquiring a crystal with a being trapped inside, especially not one with the power to save — or destroy — humanity. Her name is Lucy, and she cannot escape her prison until her mission is complete. A mission she keeps secret from everyone, even Max. But she needs his help. To gain his trust, she offers to get rid of his abusive boss in one week, and get him that promotion he always wanted. She’ll make him the hero of his own life, a man worthy of recognition, in exchange for helping her complete her mission. This could be the opportunity of Max’s life, but he can’t help but wonder if Lucy is as good as she seems… And exactly what mission she must complete to regain her freedom. Set in a dystopian, futuristic city built miles into the sky, “CODE: Revelation” is a powerful, psychological thrill ride that calls into question the nature of good and evil, and the importance of taking control of your own destiny.	200	December 24th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521844-code-revelation
