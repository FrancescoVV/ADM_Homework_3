Absalom, Absalom!		William Faulkner	3.97	38897	2153	Published in 1936, Absalom, Absalom! is considered by many to be William Faulkner's masterpiece. Although the novel's complex and fragmented structure poses considerable difficulty to readers, the book's literary merits place it squarely in the ranks of America's finest novels. The story concerns Thomas Sutpen, a poor man who finds wealth and then marries into a respectable family. His ambition and extreme need for control bring about his ruin and the ruin of his family. Sutpen's story is told by several narrators, allowing the reader to observe variations in the saga as it is recounted by different speakers. This unusual technique spotlights one of the novel's central questions: To what extent can people know the truth about the past?	316	1936	Quentin Compson III, Thomas Sutpen, Jason Compson III, Shreve, Rosa Coldfield, Ellen Coldfield, Henry Sutpen, Judith Sutpen, Charles Bon, Wash Jones, Jim Bond	United States of America, Mississippi (United States), Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/373755.Absalom_Absalom_
