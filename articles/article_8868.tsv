Until he catches wind of Claire. Claire St. James, Charlie among friends, is an amazing young woman with an incredibly special gift. Cole recognizes this at once and swears on the spot to claim Charlie as his mate. Of course, he isn't the only one with such plans. Charlie is too precious to let go without a fight, and one of the most powerful alphas in the world has already staked a claim, whether Charlie-or Cole-like it or not.	370	January 12th 2011	Claire 'Charlie' St James, Malcolm Cole, Alexander Cavanaugh, Gabriel Fallon, Dannai	Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10242444-the-strip
