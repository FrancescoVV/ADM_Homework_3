Sappho		Sappho, Mary Barnard, Dudley Fitts	4.16	4695	234	These hundred poems and fragments constitute virtually all of Sappho that survives and effectively bring to life the woman whom the Greeks consider to be their greatest lyric poet. Mary Barnard's translations are lean, incisive, direct--the best ever published. She has rendered the beloved poet's verses, long the bane of translators, more authentically than anyone else in English.	124	-600			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209828.Sappho
