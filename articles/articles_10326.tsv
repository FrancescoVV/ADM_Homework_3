The Last Convertible		Anton Myrer	4.24	1786	141	Anton Myrer's beloved, bestselling novel of America's World War II generation is as powerful now as it was upon its publication. An immediate classic, it tells the story of five Harvard men, the women they loved -- and the elegant car that came to symbolize their romantic youth. It is also the story of their coming-of-age in the dark days of World War II, and of their unshakable loyalty to a lost dream of Camelot, of grace and style, in the decades that followed. "The Last Convertible is a gripping tribute to a way of living that immortalized the "Greatest Generation."	624	March 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111831.The_Last_Convertible
