The Maid of Fairbourne Hall		Julie Klassen	4.10	11529	1284	To escape a scheme to marry her off to a dishonorable man, Margaret Macy flees London disguised as a housemaid. If she can remain unwed until her next birthday, she will receive an inheritance, and with it, sweet independence. But she never planned on actually working as a servant. And certainly not in the home of Nathaniel and Lewis Upchurch--both former suitors. As she fumbles through the first real work of her life, Margaret struggles to keep her identity secret when suspicions arise and prying eyes visit Fairbourne Hall. Can she avoid a trap meant to force her from hiding? Brimming with romance and danger, The Maid of Fairbourne Hall takes readers inside the fascinating belowstairs world of a 19th-century English manor, where appearances can be deceiving.	410	January 1st 2012	Margaret Macy, Nathaniel Upchurch, Lewis Upchurch	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11701627-the-maid-of-fairbourne-hall
