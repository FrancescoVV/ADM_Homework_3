Deathblow	Broslin Creek  #4	Dana Marton	4.28	646	98	Former small-town football hero turned cop, Joe Kessler never met a linebacker, perp, or a woman he couldn't handle. Then a troubled single mom walks into his life, and the only place this hot jock will ever see 'easy' again is in the dictionary. Hiding out in Broslin, PA was working pretty well for Wendy Belle until Cop Casanova took her under his protection.
