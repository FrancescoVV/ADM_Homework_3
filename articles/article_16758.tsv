There’s a blind folk artist, a playboy meteorologist, an investment banker with a sweet tooth, an ambitious realtor, and a cute shy web designer who just might be “the one” for Cooper. But the member of Hope Street Church who invited Cooper to join this motley crew—an office worker who got her wedding ring stuck in a copier—is something else altogether: She’s dead And her husband is suspected of murder! The Sunrise gang jumps into action, vowing to solve this unholy mess—with God’s guidance—and Cooper’s snooping… Includes heavenly recipes from Mrs. Lee’s kitchen!	338	2009	Cooper (Coop) Lee		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23293564-the-path-of-the-crooked
