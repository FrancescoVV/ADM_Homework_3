The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory		Brian Greene	4.07	87266	2031	The international bestseller that inspired a major Nova special and sparked a new understanding of the universe, now with a new preface and epilogue. Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away layers of mystery to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter—from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas—is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy. The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.	425	February 1st 1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8049273-the-elegant-universe
