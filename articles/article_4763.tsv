Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors		Piers Paul Read	4.11	65211	1335	On October 12, 1972, a plane carrying a team of young rugby players crashed into the remote, snow-peaked Andes. Out of the forty-five original passengers and crew, only sixteen made it off the mountain alive. For ten excruciating weeks they suffered deprivations beyond imagining, confronting nature head-on at its most furious and inhospitable. And to survive, they were forced to do what would have once been unthinkable... This is their story—one of the most astonishing true adventures of the twentieth century.	318	1974	Nando Parrado, Panchito Abal, Arturo Nogueira, Susanna Parrado, Marcelo Pérez, Liliana Methol, Fito Strauch, Eduardo Strauch, Daniel Fernández, Gustavo Zerbino, Roberto Canessa, Antonio Vizintin, Carlitos Páez, Pancho Delgado, Coche Inciarte, Pedro Algorta, Javier Methol, Moncho Sabella, Bobby Francois, Roy Harley, Carlos Valeta, Diego Storm, Rafael Echavarren, Entique Platero, Mrs. Mariani	Chile, Argentina, Andes Mountains, Santiago (Chile) Montevideo (Uruguay), Santiago (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/401514.Alive
