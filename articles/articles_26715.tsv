Don't Forget Steven		P.D. Workman	3.85	62	9	He never told what went on behind closed doors. But this time, he canâ€™t remember. Things never have been easy for Steven. He accepts that, and just makes the best of things. He might not have parents or a happy home. Or enough to eat most days. But at least he has a couple of loyal friends who stand by him and help out when they can. At least he has school, someplace he can go to escape the abuse. But just when he thought things couldn't get much worse, they did. Steven is accused of murder. But that isn't the worst part. The really bad part is not even knowing if he did it	206	September 25th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22837054-don-t-forget-steven
