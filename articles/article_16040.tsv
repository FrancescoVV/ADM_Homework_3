Blood Fury	Black Dagger Legacy #3	J.R. Ward	4.40	14214	1435	A vampire aristocrat of the Glymera, Peyton is well aware of his duty to his bloodline: mate with an appropriate female of his class and carry on his family’s traditions. And he thought he’d found his perfect match in Paradise—until she fell in love with someone else. When his split-second decision in a battle with the enemy endangers the life of another trainee, Peyton has to face the idea that his future, and his heart, actually lie with another. Novo, as a female in the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s training program, feels like she has to prove herself to everybody—and she has no interest in being distracted by falling in love. But when Peyton proves to be so much more than a rich playboy, she is forced to confront the tragedy that has broken her soul and closed her off from love. As the two grapple with Novo’s past and Peyton’s present, another couple must contend with an erotic connection that is unparalleled—and potentially scandalous. Saxton, who has had his heart broken, discovers in himself a deep-seated attraction to Ruhn, a new member of the household. But will the other male explore the connection? Or will he close his mind and his heart to what could be true love . . . and cost Saxton everything?	432	January 9th 2018	Saxton, Peyton (Black Dagger Legacy), Novo (Black Dagger Legacy), Ruhn	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34019141-blood-fury
