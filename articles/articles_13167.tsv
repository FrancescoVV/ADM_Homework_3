Series reading order: More Than This (Book one) More Than Her (Book two) More Than Him (Book three) More Than Forever (Book four) -- There’s no emotion greater than fear. No ache greater than grief. No sound greater than silence. *** I’m grateful he showed up on my doorstep, pissed off and angry at the world. If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t be here. And I don’t just mean here on this journey with him. I mean here, in this world. * I wonder what events in all our lives—hers included—are The Turning Points? The points where we all determine that the fear of our pasts and the uncertainty of our futures are greater than our need for happiness. Here. Now. While time and everything around us stands unmoving… who’s to say we can’t have it all? *** We wanted it all. We wanted it with each other. We thrived on the chaos we created. And ignored the Mayhem that ensued. Because falling in love was easy. But sometimes, love isn’t enough.	454	November 5th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27507850-more-than-enough
