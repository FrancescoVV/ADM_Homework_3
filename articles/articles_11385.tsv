Escape from Memory		Margaret Peterson Haddix	3.83	3316	227	While playing around with hypnotism at a party, Kira remembers fleeing a war-torn country with her mother, speaking a language she can't identify. A few days later her mother disappears, and a woman who calls herself Kira's aunt Memory takes Kira to Crythe, a country that doesn't officially exist, in order to rescue her – or so she says. Kira soon learns that Aunt Memory is not what she seems, and Kira and her mother are both in terrible danger. There are memories locked in Kira's mind that could get her and her mother killed. But those memories are the only things that might save them...	288	2003	Kira (Escape from Memory), Sophia (Escape from Memory), Lynne Robertson, Mr. Robertson (Escape from Memory), Aunt Memory		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/303073.Escape_from_Memory
