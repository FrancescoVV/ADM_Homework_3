Weep No More, My Lady	Alvirah & Willy #1	Mary Higgins Clark	3.83	13803	365	The New York Times calls Mary Higgins Clark's masterpiece "the ideal book for the beach bag, picnic hamper, or carry-on luggage." "Well done and very scary," says Cosmopolitan . Prepare yourself for the Queen of Suspense's "crackling tale of menace and love that holds your attention to the last page" (Andrew M. Greeley). Elizabeth Lange has arrived at Cypress Point Spa in Pebble Beach, California, weary of heart and soul. Still grieving for her beloved sister, a famous actress who plunged to her death from her Manhattan penthouse, Elizabeth is determined to unearth the truth about how Leila died. Dashing millionaire Ted Winters stands accused of her murder, but Elizabeth has doubts. Along the windswept cliffs of the Monterey coast, in luxurious bungalows, between gourmet meals and beachfront walks, uneasiness stalks Elizabeth while she begins opening doors to the past. As glimpses of the dark truth about Leila's life and death -- and about Elizabeth herself -- start to crash against her mind, an ominous wave from an unexpected source threatens to engulf her entirely.	360	1987	Alvirah Meehan, Elizabeth Lange, Andrew "Ted" Edward Winters III, Minna "Min" von Schreiber, Helmut von Schreiber, Scott Alshore, Syd Melnick, Cheryl Manning, Craig Babcock, Leila LaSalle	Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States), Pebble Beach, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170622.Weep_No_More_My_Lady
