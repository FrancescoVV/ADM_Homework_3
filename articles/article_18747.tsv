Tiger's Curse Preview		Colleen Houck	4.65	1084	54	Passion. Fate. Loyalty. Would you risk it all to change your destiny? The last thing Kelsey Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300-year old Indian curse. With a mysterious white tiger named Ren. Halfway around the world. But that's exactly what happened. Face-to-face with dark forces, spellbinding magic, and mystical worlds where nothing is what it seems, Kelsey risks everything to piece together an ancient prophecy that could break the curse forever. Tiger's Curse is the exciting first volume in an epic fantasy-romance that will leave you breathless and yearning for more. EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK: “I was dying. I knew it. At least the pain was gone. I wanted to tell him that I loved him. Then darkness overtook me…” PRAISE FOR TIGER'S CURSE: “…a sweet romance and heart-pounding adventure. I found myself cheering, squealing and biting my nails-all within a few pages. In short, Tiger's Curse is magical!” -Becca Fitzpatrick, New York Times bestselling author of Hush, Hush		December 13th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9936690-tiger-s-curse-preview
