Dying For Revenge	The Lady Doc Murders #1	Barbara Golder	4.29	112	28	Finalist Next Generation Indie Book Awards 2017 Christian Fiction “Barbara Golder joins the ranks of Chesterton’s bloodthirsty heirs as she spins a tale that will delight mystery fans. With Dying for Revenge in hand, your beach experience is now complete!” Mark P. Shea, Author of "Mercy Works" Someone is killing the rich and famous residents of Telluride, Colorado, and the medical investigator, Dr. Jane Wallace, is on a collision course with the murderer. Compelled by profound loss and injustice, Jane will risk her own life to protect others from vengeful death, even as she exacts a high price from those who have destroyed her world. DYING FOR REVENGE is a story of love, obsession and forgiveness, seen through the eyes of a passionate, beautiful woman trying to live her life -- imperfectly but vibrantly -- even if she won't survive. “Dying for Revenge dives into the deeply personal place in so many hearts with “justifiable” reasons for revenge... but the face of mercy is entwined in the unexpected turn of events. You’ll be captivated...” Patricia M. Chivers ABLAZE Radio WNRE-LP 98.1 FM Catholic Church of Saint Monica	368	May 20th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30237909-dying-for-revenge
