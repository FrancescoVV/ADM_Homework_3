Into the Wild	Into the Wild #1	Sarah Beth Durst	3.69	2401	323	Twelve-year-old Julie has grown up hearing about the dangerous world of fairy tales, The Wild, from which her mother, Rapunzel, escaped. Now The Wild wants its characters back. Julie comes home from school to find her mother gone and a deep, dark forest swallowing her hometown. Julie must fight wicked witches, avoid glass slippers and fairy godmothers, fly griffins, and outwit ogres in order to rescue her mom and save her Massachusetts town from becoming a fairy-tale kingdom. Sarah Beth Durst weaves a postmodern fairy tale that's fresh, funny, and sweetly poignant.	260	June 21st 2007		Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170136.Into_the_Wild
