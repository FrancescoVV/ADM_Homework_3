Greywalker	Greywalker #1	Kat Richardson	3.45	13165	1155	Harper Blaine was your average small-time P.I. until a two-bit perp's savage assault left her dead for two minutes. When she comes to in the hospital, she sees things that can only be described as weird-shapes emerging from a foggy grey mist, snarling teeth, creatures roaring. But Harper's not crazy. Her "death" has made her a Greywalker- able to move between the human world and the mysterious cross-over zone where things that go bump in the night exist. And her new gift is about to drag her into that strange new realm-whether she likes it or not.	341	October 3rd 2006	Harper Blaine	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140099.Greywalker
