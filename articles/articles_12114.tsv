Sacré Bleu: A Comedy d'Art		Christopher Moore	3.79	30154	3606	In his latest novel, Moore takes on the Great French Masters. A magnificent “Comedy d’Art”, Sacré Bleu is part mystery, part history (sort of), part love story, and wholly hilarious as it follows a young baker-painter who joins the dapper Henri Toulouse-Lautrec on a quest to unravel the mystery behind the supposed suicide of Vincent van Gogh.	403	April 3rd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40409748-sacr-bleu
