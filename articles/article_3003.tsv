Dragonsong	Harper Hall of Pern #1	Anne McCaffrey	4.21	51015	1478	It was not Threadfall that made Menolly unhappy. It was her father who betrayed her ambition to be a Harper, who thwarted her love of music. Menolly had no choice but to run away. She came upon a group of fire lizards, wild relatives of the fire-breathing dragons. Her music swirled about them; she taught nine to sing, suddenly Menolly was no longer alone.	192	March 1976	Menolly	Pern	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28541.Dragonsong
