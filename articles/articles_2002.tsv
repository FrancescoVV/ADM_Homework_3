Written in Red	The Others #1	Anne Bishop	4.26	50719	5727	As a cassandra sangue , or blood prophet, Meg Corbyn can see the future when her skin is cut—a gift that feels more like a curse. Meg’s Controller keeps her enslaved so he can have full access to her visions. But when she escapes, the only safe place Meg can hide is at the Lakeside Courtyard—a business district operated by the Others. Shape-shifter Simon Wolfgard is reluctant to hire the stranger who inquires about the Human Liaison job. First, he senses she’s keeping a secret, and second, she doesn’t smell like human prey. Yet a stronger instinct propels him to give Meg the job. And when he learns the truth about Meg and that she’s wanted by the government, he’ll have to decide if she’s worth the fight between humans and the Others that will surely follow.	433	March 1st 2013	Meg Corbyn, Vladimir Sanguinati, Simon Wolfgard, Henry Beargard, Crispin James Montgomery, Tess, Asia Crane, Blair Wolfgard, Elliot Wolfgard, Karl Kowalski, Nathan Wolfgard, Jester Coyotegard, Erebus Sanguinati, Winter, Jake Crowgard, Sam Wolfgard		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15711341-written-in-red
