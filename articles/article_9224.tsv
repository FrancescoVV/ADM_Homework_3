The Broom of the System		David Foster Wallace	3.84	19240	1525	Published when Wallace was just twenty-four years old, The Broom of the System stunned critics and marked the emergence of an extraordinary new talent. At the center of this outlandishly funny, fiercely intelligent novel is the bewitching heroine, Lenore Stonecipher Beadsman. The year is 1990 and the place is a slightly altered Cleveland, Ohio. Lenoreâ€™s great-grandmother has disappeared with twenty-five other inmates of the Shaker Heights Nursing Home. Her beau, and boss, Rick Vigorous, is insanely jealous, and her cockatiel, Vlad the Impaler, has suddenly started spouting a mixture of psycho-babble, Auden, and the King James Bible. Ingenious and entertaining, this debut from one of the most innovative writers of his generation brilliantly explores the paradoxes of language, storytelling, and reality.	467	January 6th 1987	Lenore Beadsman, Rick Vigorous, Candy Mandible, Andy (Wang-Dang) Lang, Melinda (Mindy) Metalman, Clarice Beadsman, Stonecipher LaVache Beadsman, Stonecipher Beadsman III, John Beadsman, Patrice LaVache Beadsman, Vlad The Impaler (TBODS), Dr. Jay Curtis, Norman Bombardini, Mr. Bloemker	Cleveland, Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6750.The_Broom_of_the_System
