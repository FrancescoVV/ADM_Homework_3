City of Lost Souls	The Mortal Instruments #5	Cassandra Clare	4.26	427200	20243	The New York Times bestselling Mortal Instruments continues—and so do the thrills and danger for Jace, Clary, and Simon. What price is too high to pay, even for love? When Jace and Clary meet again, Clary is horrified to discover that the demon Lilith’s magic has bound her beloved Jace together with her evil brother Sebastian, and that Jace has become a servant of evil. The Clave is out to destroy Sebastian, but there is no way to harm one boy without destroying the other. As Alec, Magnus, Simon, and Isabelle wheedle and bargain with Seelies, demons, and the merciless Iron Sisters to try to save Jace, Clary plays a dangerous game of her own. The price of losing is not just her own life, but Jace’s soul. She’s willing to do anything for Jace, but can she still trust him? Or is he truly lost? Love. Blood. Betrayal. Revenge. Darkness threatens to claim the Shadowhunters in the harrowing fifth book of the Mortal Instruments series.	546	May 8th 2012	Alexander "Alec" Lightwood, Jonathan "Jace" Wayland, Isabelle "Izzy" Sophia Lightwood, Magnus Bane, Jordan Kyle, Maia Roberts, Jocelyn Fray, Luke Garroway, Sebastian Morgenstern, Aline Penhallow, Camille Belcourt, Clarissa "Clary" Fray, Jonathan Morgenstern, Simon Lewis	New York City, New York (United States), Venice (Italy), Prague (Praha) (Czech Republic), Paris (France) Ireland, Paris (France), Ireland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8755776-city-of-lost-souls
