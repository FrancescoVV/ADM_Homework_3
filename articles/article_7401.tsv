Old Turtle		Douglas Wood, Cheng-Khee Chee	4.39	1732	153	Experience the wisdom of Old Turtle , the bestselling fable that explores society, the environment, and the spirituality they share. Who is God? Is He a wind that is never still? Is He a rock that never moves? Is He high above or here among us? Venerable Old Turtle answers quietly: God is all of these things. Old Turtle first burst upon the publishing scene in 1992, and it was instantly recognized as a classic fable about ecology, peace, and the interconnectedness of all beings. Simple yet profound, it has since brought hope and inspiration to children and adults around the world.	56	October 1st 1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228879.Old_Turtle
