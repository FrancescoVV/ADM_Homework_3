The Keeper of Lost Causes	Afdeling Q #1	Jussi Adler-Olsen, Lisa Hartford	3.99	65662	5139	Carl Mørck used to be one of Copenhagen’s best homicide detectives. Then a hail of bullets destroyed the lives of two fellow cops, and Carl—who didn’t draw his weapon—blames himself. So a promotion is the last thing he expects. But Department Q is a department of one, and Carl’s got only a stack of Copenhagen’s coldest cases for company. His colleagues snicker, but Carl may have the last laugh, because one file keeps nagging at him: a liberal politician vanished five years earlier and is presumed dead. But she isn’t dead … yet. Darkly humorous, propulsive, and atmospheric, The Keeper of Lost Causes introduces American readers to the mega-bestselling series fast becoming an international sensation.	400	September 12th 2007	Carl Mørck, Hafez el-Assad, Rose Knudsen		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10822858-the-keeper-of-lost-causes
