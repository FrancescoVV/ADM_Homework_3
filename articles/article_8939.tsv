Tobacco Road		Erskine Caldwell, Lewis Nordan, David Fredenthal	3.73	13654	769	The classic novel of a Georgia family undone by the Great Depression: “[A] story of force and beauty” (New York Post). Even before the Great Depression struck, Jeeter Lester and his family were desperately poor sharecroppers. But when hard times begin to affect the families that once helped support them, the Lesters slip completely into the abyss. Rather than hold on to each other for support, Jeeter, his wife Ada, and their twelve children are overcome by the fractured and violent society around them. Banned and burned when first released in 1932, Tobacco Road is a brutal examination of poverty’s dehumanizing influence by one of America’s great masters of political fiction.	192	1932	Jeeter Lester	Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59091.Tobacco_Road
