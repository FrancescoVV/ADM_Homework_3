Coolie		Mulk Raj Anand	3.77	706	76	Coolie portrays the picaresque adventures of Munoo, a young boy forced to leave his hill village to fend for himself and discover the world. His journey takes him far from home to towns and cities, to Bomboy and Simla, sweating as servant, factory-worker and rickshaw driver. It is a fight for survival that illuminates, with raw immediacy, the grim fate of the masses in pre-Partition India. Together with Untouchable , Coolie places Mulk Raj Anand among the twentieth century's finest Indian novelists writing in English.	282	1936			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/526024.Coolie
