The History of Sexuality, Volume 2: The Use of Pleasure	The History of Sexuality #2	Michel Foucault, Robert Hurley	4.07	3447	109	In this sequel to The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction , the brilliantly original French thinker who died in 1984 gives an analysis of how the ancient Greeks perceived sexuality. Throughout The Uses of Pleasure Foucault analyzes an irresistible array of ancient Greek texts on eroticism as he tries to answer basic questions: How in the West did sexual experience become a moral issue? And why were other appetites of the body, such as hunger, and collective concerns, such as civic duty, not subjected to the numberless rules and regulations and judgments that have defined, if not confined, sexual behavior?	304	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1878.The_History_of_Sexuality_Volume_2
