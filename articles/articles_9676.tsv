The Two-Bear Mambo	Hap and Leonard #3	Joe R. Lansdale	4.13	3818	266	Florida Grange, Leonard's drop-dead gorgeous lawyer and Hap's former lover, has vanished in Klan-infested Grovetown while in pursuit of the real story behind the jailhouse death of a legendary bluesman's blackguard son. Fearing the worst, Hap and Leonard set out to do the kind of investigating the good ole boy cops can't - or won't - do. In Grovetown they encounter a redneck police chief, a sadistic Christmas tree grower, and townsfolk itchin' for a lynchin'. Add to this a dark night exhumation in a voodoo graveyard, a thunderstorm of Biblical proportions, and flat-out sudden murder. Hap and Leonard vow to face the hate and find Florida, even if Leonard has to put a hole in anyone who gets in the way. Besides, they've packed a lunch.		1995	Hap Collins, Leonard Pine	LaBorde, Texas (fictional) (United States), Grovetown, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102117.The_Two_Bear_Mambo
