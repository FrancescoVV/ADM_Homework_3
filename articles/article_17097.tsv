A Star Called Henry	The Last Roundup #1	Roddy Doyle	3.84	8330	576	Born at the beginning of the twentieth century, Henry Smart lives through the evolution of modern Ireland, and in this extraordinary novel he brilliantly tells his story. From his own birth and childhood on the streets of Dublin to his role as soldier (and lover) in the Irish Rebellion, Henry recounts his early years of reckless heroism and adventure. At once an epic, a love story, and a portrait of Irish history, A Star Called Henry is a grand picaresque novel brimming with both poignant moments and comic ones, and told in a voice that is both quintessentially Irish and inimitably Roddy Doyle's.	342	1999	Ã‰amon de Valera, Michael Collins, Henry Smart, Granny Nash, Miss O'Shea, James Connolly, Patrick Pearse, Countess Markievicz, Piano Annie, Alfie Gandon, Dolly Oblong, Henry Smart, snr., Ivan Reynolds, Victor Smart, Melody Nash, Dick McKee, Mr Costello, Thomas Patrick Ashe, Arthur Griffith, Cathal Brugha, David Climanis, Maria Climanis, Edward VII	Dublin (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42718.A_Star_Called_Henry
