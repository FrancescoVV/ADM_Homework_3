The Pursuit of God: The Human Thirst for the Divine		A.W. Tozer	4.34	60153	1851	“As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.” This thirst for an intimate relationship with God, claims A.W. Tozer, is not for a select few, but should be the experience of every follower of Christ. Here is a masterly study of the inner life by a heart thirsting after God. Here is a book for every child of God, pastor, missionary, and Christian. It deals with the deep things of God and the riches of His grace. In The Pursuit of God, Tozer sheds light on the path to a closer walk with God.	128	1948			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/672493.The_Pursuit_of_God
