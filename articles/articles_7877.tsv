Double Standards		Judith McNaught	3.94	11118	436	In the exclusive, glittering world of business superstars, Nick Sinclair was a legend... The ruggedly handsome president of Global Industries handled his business the way he handled his women -- with charm, daring and ruthless self-control. A man used to the very best, Nick hired Lauren Danner, and assumed the proud beauty would soon be another easy conquest. But Lauren's flashing wit and rare spirit dazzled him -- and slowly, against his will, he was intrigued, challenged -- and in love. Yet Lauren was living a lie, a charade that became more dangerous with every passing moment. Trapped in a web of deceit, she fought her growing love for Nick. Her secret could destroy his fragile trust -- and the promise of life with the most compelling man she had ever met!	310	1984	Nick Sinclair, Lauren Danner	Detroit, Michigan (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129615.Double_Standards
