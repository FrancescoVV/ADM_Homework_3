Six Impossible Things	The Six Impossiverse #1	Fiona Wood	3.75	3824	442	Fourteen-year-old nerd-boy Dan Cereill is not quite coping with a reversal of family fortune, moving house, new school hell, a mother with a failing wedding cake business, a just-out gay dad, and an impossible crush on the girl next door. His life is a mess, but for now he's narrowed it down to just six impossible things... "I loved this book so much I wanted to be in it."
