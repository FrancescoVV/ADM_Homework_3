Please Stop Laughing at Me... One Woman's Inspirational Story		Jodee Blanco	3.85	11621	1191	In her poignant work, Jodee Blanco tells how school became a frightening and painful place, where threats, humiliation, and assault were as much a part of her daily experience as bubblegum and lip-gloss were for others. It is an unflinching look at what it means to be an outcast, how even the most loving parents can get it wrong, why schools fail, and how bullying is both misunderstood and mishandled.	288	February 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18931.Please_Stop_Laughing_at_Me_One_Woman_s_Inspirational_Story
