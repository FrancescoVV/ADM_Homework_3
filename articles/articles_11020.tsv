A Dance of Cloaks	Shadowdance #1	David Dalglish	3.75	12036	613	Thren Felhorn is the greatest assassin of his time. Marshalling the thieves’ guilds under his control, he declares war against the Trifect, an allegiance of wealthy and powerful nobles. Aaron Felhorn has been groomed since birth to be Thren’s heir. Sent to kill the daughter of a priest, Aaron instead risks his own life to protect her from the wrath of his guild. In doing so, he glimpses a world beyond poison, daggers, and the iron control of his father. Guilds twist and turn, trading allegiances for survival. The Trifect weakens, its reputation broken, its money dwindling. The players take sides as the war nears its end, and Thren puts in motion a plan to execute hundreds. Only Aaron can stop the massacre and protect those he loves… Assassin or protector; every choice has its consequences.	448	August 16th 2010	Thren Felhorn, Aaron Fellhorn		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9601799-a-dance-of-cloaks
