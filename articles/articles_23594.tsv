Mrs. Jeffries and the Mistletoe Mix-Up	Mrs. Jeffries  #29	Emily Brightwell	3.92	718	86	Ring in the season with another Mrs. Jeffries tale of holiday homicide. Under a bundle of mistletoe, art collector Daniel McCourt lies with his throat slit, a bloody sword next to his body. Inspector Witherspoon is determined to solve the case-preferably before the eggnog is ladled out on Christmas Eve-but of course he will require assistance from the always sharp-witted housekeeper, Mrs. Jeffries, who has a few of her own theories on why McCourt had to die by the sword.	265	November 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11363759-mrs-jeffries-and-the-mistletoe-mix-up
