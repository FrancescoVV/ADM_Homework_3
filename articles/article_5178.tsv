Secrets of a Summer Night	Wallflowers #1	Lisa Kleypas	4.05	53427	2994	Four young ladies at the side of the ballroom make a pact to help each other find husbands...no matter what it takes... Proud and beautiful Annabelle Peyton could have her pick of suitors—if only she had a dowry. Her family is on the brink of disaster, and the only way Annabelle can save them is to marry a wealthy man. Unfortunately her most persistent admirer is the brash Simon Hunt, a handsome and ambitious entrepreneur who wants her as his mistress. Annabelle is determined to resist Simon's wicked propositions, but she can't deny her attraction to the boldly seductive rogue, any more than he can resist the challenge she presents. As they try to outmaneuver each other, they find themselves surrendering to a love more powerful than they could have ever imagined. But fate may have other plans—and it will take all of Annabelle's courage to face a peril that could destroy everything she holds dear.	384	October 26th 2004	Lillian Bowman, Daisy Bowman, Annabelle Peyton, Simon Hunt, Evangeline "Evie" Jenner, Marcus Marsden, Earl of Westcliff	London, England (United Kingdom), Hampshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114162.Secrets_of_a_Summer_Night
