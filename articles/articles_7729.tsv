The Hourglass Door	Hourglass Door  #1	Lisa Mangum	3.83	9899	1828	His past. Her future. Can love bring them together in time? Abby's senior year of high school is textbook perfect, until she meets Dante Alexander, a foreign-exchange student from Italy. Time behaves differently when they are together - too fast or slow or seeming to stop. When the band Zero Hour performs at the local hangout, they have a bizarre influence over their audience, and Abby's best friend, Valerie, is caught in their snare. Dante helped Leonardo Da Vinci build a time machine, then was sent 500+ years into the future as punishment when falsely accused of being a traitor. As past and present collide, Abby learns she holds a special power over time itself.	400	May 1st 2009	Abagail Beatrice Edmunds, Dante Alexander		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6217361-the-hourglass-door
