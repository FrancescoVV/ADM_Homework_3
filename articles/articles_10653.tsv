The Last Pages		Lara Whatley	4.27	30	11	“It’s too late,” he said. “What do you mean?” Kale asked, clutching her shawl tightly around her shoulders. “It’s too late,” he repeated simply. “They’ve come.” That was when Kale’s world collapsed. Caught up in treason and murder, she doesn’t know whether to trust the person who dragged her into this in the first place, or the people hunting them both. And there is someone stirring in the shadows, someone who has watched at a distance for years. The forces are moving, but into whose favour? It seems like everyone demands Kale’s capture. Why? There is only one who knows.	250	June 17th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23279995-the-last-pages
