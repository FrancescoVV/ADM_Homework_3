The White Road	Morland Dynasty #28	Cynthia Harrod-Eagles	4.28	271	10	August 1914 The whole country is thrilled by the declaration of war. The British Expeditionary Force goes off to France to defend gallant little Belgium, and thousands more young men rush to volunteer, hoping to see action before the war ends at Christmas. At home everyone competes to be doing the most for the war effort. The Morlands have their share of volunteers, and no-one can say they aren't at the very heart of things. But when Christmas comes the war is far from over, and nine in ten of the men who marched, singing, down the white road to Mons have fallen.	480	2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20023.The_White_Road
