Heartless	Pretty Little Liars #7	Sara Shepard	4.07	38590	1350	Four gorgeous girls are telling very ugly stories. First Emily, Aria, Hanna, and Spencer claimed they found a dead body in the woods behind Spencer's house, only to have it vanish without a trace. Then, when the same woods went up in flames, they swore they saw someone who's supposed to be dead rise from the ashes. And even after all that, the pretty little liars are still playing with fire. Call me heartless, but it's about time someone shut these liars up for good. After all, nobody likes a girl who cries wolfâ€”least of all me.	274	January 19th 2010	Aria Montgomery, Emily Fields, Hanna Marin, Spencer Hastings	Rosewood, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3047848-heartless
