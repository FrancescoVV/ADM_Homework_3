Zorgamazoo		Robert Paul Weston, Víctor Rivas	4.07	1929	469	Zorgamazoo is the story of an adventurous girl; a mysterious creature; a bizarre lottery; a secret map; an alien world; some outrageous kidnappings; and a sport that brings together the finer points of cricket, swimming and chess. It also has lobotomies. In short, it's about saving the universe from boredom. And it rhymes—all 280 pages worth.	281	October 16th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3284192-zorgamazoo
