Ice Planet Barbarians	Ice Planet Barbarians #1	Ruby Dixon	3.86	15178	1993	You'd think being abducted by aliens would be the worst thing that could happen to me. And you'd be wrong. Because now, the aliens are having ship trouble, and they've left their cargo of human women - including me - on an ice planet. And the only native inhabitant I've met? He's big, horned, blue, and really, really has a thing for me...	188	April 3rd 2015	Georgie, Vektal		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25128811-ice-planet-barbarians
