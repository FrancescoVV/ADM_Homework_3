The Fiery Cross	Outlander #5	Diana Gabaldon, Janos Farkas	4.24	172844	7230	The year is 1771, and war is coming. Jamie Fraser’s wife tells him so. Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful prophecy—a time-traveler’s certain knowledge. Claire’s unique view of the future has brought him both danger and deliverance in the past; her knowledge of the oncoming revolution is a flickering torch that may light his way through the perilous years ahead—or ignite a conflagration that will leave their lives in ashes.	1443	November 6th 2001	Jamie Fraser, Brianna Randall, Roger MacKenzie, Jeremiah MacKenzie, Fergus Fraser, Marsali Fraser, Germain Fraser, Jocasta Cameron, Duncan Innes, Claire Randall Fraser, Stephen Bonnet, Young Ian Murray	North Carolina (United States), Mount Holicon, The Royal Colony of North Carolina , 1770 (United States), Mount Holicon, The Royal Colony of North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10967.The_Fiery_Cross
