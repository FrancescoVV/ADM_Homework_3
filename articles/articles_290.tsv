Invisible Man		Ralph Ellison	3.88	157204	5993	First published in 1952 and immediately hailed as a masterpiece, Invisible Man is one of those rare novels that have changed the shape of American literature. For not only does Ralph Ellison's nightmare journey across the racial divide tell unparalleled truths about the nature of bigotry and its effects on the minds of both victims and perpetrators, it gives us an entirely new model of what a novel can be. As he journeys from the Deep South to the streets and basements of Harlem, from a horrifying "battle royal" where black men are reduced to fighting animals, to a Communist rally where they are elevated to the status of trophies, Ralph Ellison's nameless protagonist ushers readers into a parallel universe that throws our own into harsh and even hilarious relief. Suspenseful and sardonic, narrated in a voice that takes in the symphonic range of the American language, black and white, Invisible Man is one of the most audacious and dazzling novels of our century.	581	April 14th 1952	Mr. Norton, Jim Trueblood, Dr. Hebert Bledsoe, Mary Rambo, Lucius Brockway, Brother Jack, Tod Clifton, Ras the Exhorter, Sybil (Invisible Man), Unnamed Narrator	New York City, New York (United States), Harlem, New York City, New York (United States), Alabama (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16981.Invisible_Man
