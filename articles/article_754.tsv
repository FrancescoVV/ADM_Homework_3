The Sorrows of Young Werther		Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Philippe Forget, Dr. Riaz-ul-Hassan, Edla Valdna, Hugo Flintzer, R. Dillon Boylan, Charles Louis De Sevelinges, Robert Graves, Isidora Sekulić, Pierre Leroux, Burton Pike, Branko Mušicki, Xavier Marmier	3.67	86045	4388	This is Goethe's first novel, published in 1774. Written in diary form, it tells the tale of an unhappy, passionate young man hopelessly in love with Charlotte, the wife of a friend - a man who he alternately admires and detests. 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' became an important part of the 'Sturm und Drang movement, and greatly influenced later 'Romanticism'. The work is semi-autobiographical - in 1772, two years before the novel was published, Goethe had passed through a similar tempestuous period, when he lost his heart to Charlotte Buff, who was at that time engaged to his friend Johann Christian Kestner.	149	1744	Werther, Albert Kestner, Charlotte Buff Kestner	Wahlheim, Germany	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16640.The_Sorrows_of_Young_Werther
