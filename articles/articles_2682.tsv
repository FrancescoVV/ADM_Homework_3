Witch & Wizard	Witch & Wizard #1	James Patterson, Gabrielle Charbonnet, Emily Raymond	3.56	53112	4699	The world is changing—the government has seized control of every aspect of society, and now kids are disappearing. For fifteen-year-old Wisty and her older brother Whit, life turns upside-down when they are hauled out of bed one night, separated from their parents, and thrown into a secret compound for no reason they can comprehend. The new government is clearly trying to suppress Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Being a Normal Teenager. Imprisoned together and condemned to death, Wisty and Whit begin exhibiting strange abilities and powers they never dreamed of. Maybe there is a reason they were singled out. Can this newly discovered witch and wizard master their skills in time to save themselves, their parents—and maybe the world?	314	December 14th 2009	Wisty Allgood, Whit Allgood		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6387565-witch-wizard
