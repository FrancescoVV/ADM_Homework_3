Shopaholic Ties the Knot	Shopaholic #3	Sophie Kinsella	3.78	104246	2611	Life has been good for Becky Bloomwood: She’s become the best personal shopper at Barneys, she and her successful entrepreneurial boyfriend, Luke, are living happily in Manhattan’s West Village, and her new next-door neighbor is a fashion designer! But with her best friend, Suze, engaged, how can Becky fail to notice that her own ring finger is bare? Not that she’s been thinking of marriage (or diamonds) or anything . . . Then Luke proposes! Bridal registries dance in Becky’s head. Problem is, two other people are planning her wedding: Becky’s overjoyed mother has been waiting forever to host a backyard wedding, with the bride resplendent in Mum’s frilly old gown. While Luke’s high-society mother is insisting on a glamorous, all-expenses-paid affair at the Plaza. Both weddings for the same day. And Becky can’t seem to turn down either one. Can everyone’s favorite shopaholic tie the knot before everything unravels?	407	April 30th 2002	Becky Bloomwood, Luke Brandon, Susan Cleath-Stuart, Tarquin Cleath-Stuart, Elinor Sherman	New York City, New York (United States), Oxshott, Surrey, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9419.Shopaholic_Ties_the_Knot
