Destined	House of Night #9	P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast	4.04	74088	2711	In Destined, the forces of Light and Dark collide as their epic struggle focuses on Tulsa’s House of Night. Zoey is home where she belongs, safe with her Guardian Warrior, Stark, by her side – and preparing to face off against Neferet. Kalona has released his hold on Rephaim, and, through Nyx’s gift of a human form, he and Stevie Rae are finally able to be together – if Rephaim can truly walk the path of the Goddess and stay free of his father’s shadow. But is Zoey really safe? Does she truly know those who are closest to her? And will love win when it is tested by the very soul of Darkness?	325	October 25th 2011	Zoey Redbird, Nyx (House of Night), Stevie Rae Johnson, Neferet, Aphrodite LaFont, Kalona, Sylvia Redbird, Erin Bates, Shaunee Cole, Damien Maslin, James Stark, Rephaim, Kramisha, Darius Langley, Pea Chamberlain, Griffin DeAngelo, Aurox	Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7933617-destined
