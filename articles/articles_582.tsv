The Bean Trees	Greer Family #1	Barbara Kingsolver	3.97	135292	6462	Clear-eyed and spirited, Taylor Greer grew up poor in rural Kentucky with the goals of avoiding pregnancy and getting away. But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has acquired a completely unexpected child, a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.	232	December 1st 1988	Taylor Greer, Turtle Greer, Lou Ann Ruiz, Estevan, Esperanza, Mattie	Tucson, Arizona (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30868.The_Bean_Trees
