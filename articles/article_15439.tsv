Cymbeline		William Shakespeare	3.58	7253	523	Cymbeline tells the story of a British king, Cymbeline, and his three children, presented as though they are in a fairy tale. The secret marriage of Cymbeline’s daughter, Imogen, triggers much of the action, which includes villainous slander, homicidal jealousy, cross-gender disguise, a deathlike trance, and the appearance of Jupiter in a vision. Cymbeline displays unusually powerful emotions with a tremendous charge. Like some of Shakespeare’s other late work—especially The Winter’s Tale and The Tempest—it is an improbable story lifted into a nearly mythic realm.	324	1610	Imogen, Cymbeline, King of Britain, Queen, Wife to Cymbeline, Cloten		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/305510.Cymbeline
