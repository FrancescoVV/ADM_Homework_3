Herzog		Saul Bellow, Philip Roth	3.77	18909	1139	This is the story of Moses Herzog, a great sufferer, joker, mourner, and charmer. Although his life steadily disintegrates around him - he has failed as a writer and teacher, as a father, and has lost the affection of his wife to his best friend - Herzog sees himself as a survivor, both of his private disasters and those of the age. He writes unsent letters to friends and enemies, colleagues and famous people, revealing his wry perception of the world around him, and the innermost secrets of his heart.	371	1964	Moses Elkanah Herzog, Miss Schwartz, Harvey Simkin, June Herzog, Himmelstein, Gersbach, Madeleine (Herzog), Ramona (Herzog)	Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6551.Herzog
