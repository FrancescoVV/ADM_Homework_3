Brazzaville Beach		William  Boyd	3.94	4947	370	In the heart of a civil war-torn African nation, primate researcher Hope Clearwater made a shocking discovery about apes and man . . . Young, alone, and far from her family in Britain, Hope Clearwater contemplates the extraordinary events that left her washed up like driftwood on Brazzaville Beach. It is here, on the distant, lonely outskirts of Africa, where she must come to terms with the perplexing and troubling circumstances of her recent past. For Hope is a survivor of the devastating cruelities of apes and humans alike. And to move forward, she must first grasp some hard and elusive truths: about marriage and madness, about the greed and savagery of charlatan science . . . and about what compels seemingly benign creatures to kill for pleasure alone.	320	September 2nd 1990	Hope Clearwater, Eugene Mallabar, John Clearwater, Usman Shoukry	Republic of the Congo (Central African Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77829.Brazzaville_Beach
