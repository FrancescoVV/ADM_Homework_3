Thief	Love Me with Lies #3	Tarryn Fisher	4.37	34360	3856	Note to Self Love is patient; love is kind. Love doesn't boast or brag. There's no arrogance in love; it's never rude, crude, or indecent-it's not self absorbed. Love isn't easily upset. Love doesn't tally wrongs. Love trusts, hopes, and endures no matter what. Love will never become obsolete. I'll fight for her. Thief Caleb Drake never got over his first love. Not when he got married. Not when she got married. When life suddenly comes full circle Caleb must decide how far he is willing to go to get the aloof and alluring Olivia Kaspen back. But for every action in life there is a consequence, and soon Caleb finds out that sometimes love comes at an unbearably high price.	273	July 21st 2013	Olivia Kaspen, Caleb Drake, Leah Smith, Noah Stein, Cammie Chase		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16090981-thief
