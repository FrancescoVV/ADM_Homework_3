The Trouble with Being Born		Emil M. Cioran, Richard Howard	4.18	4294	441	In this volume, which reaffirms the uncompromising brilliance of his mind, Cioran strips the human condition down to its most basic components, birth and death, suggesting that disaster lies not in the prospect of death but in the fact of birth, "that laughable accident." In the lucid, aphoristic style that characterizes his work, Cioran writes of time and death, God and religion, suicide and suffering, and the temptation to silence. In all his writing, Cioran cuts to the heart of the human experience.	212	1973			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117564.The_Trouble_with_Being_Born
