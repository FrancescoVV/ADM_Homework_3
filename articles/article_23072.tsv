The Last Leaves Falling		Fox Benwell	3.93	1859	440	And these are they. My final moments. They say a warrior must always be mindful of death, but I never imagined that it would find me like this . . . Japanese teenager Sora is diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease). Lonely and isolated, Sora turns to the ancient wisdom of the samurai for guidance and comfort. But he also finds hope in the present; through the internet he finds friends that see him, not just his illness. This is a story of friendship and acceptance, and testing strength in an uncertain future.	342	January 29th 2015		Kyoto (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20743633-the-last-leaves-falling
