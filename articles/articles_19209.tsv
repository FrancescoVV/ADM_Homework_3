POQUITO: UNPACKING THE MEMORY JAR		Tanya Mont√°s Paris	4.97	30	1	Poquito: is indeed a collection of bits of many things cramped together inside a memory jar. Through small fragments and short, personal narratives, the author invites you to step into her childhood of clear-water playas, savor the joys and heartaches of motherhood, and celebrate the bravery of facing sorrow and despair. The author adds flavor to the writing by weaving English and Spanish throughout some of the stories.	129	November 1st 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42862101-poquito
