Ruined	Ruined #1	Paula Morris	3.83	12854	1383	A gripping YA supernatural novel set in New Orleans: Twilight with a ghostly twist. Rebecca couldn't feel more out of place in New Orleans, where she comes to spend the year while her dad is traveling. She's staying in a creepy old house with her Aunt Claudia, who reads Tarot cards for a living. And at the snooty prep school, a pack of filthy-rich girls treat Rebecca like she's invisible. Only gorgeous, unavailable Anton Grey seems to give Rebecca the time of day, but she wonders if he's got a hidden agenda. Then one night, in Lafayette Cemetery, Rebecca makes a friend. Sweet, mysterious Lisette is eager to talk to Rebecca, and to show her the nooks and crannies of the city.	309	August 1st 2009		New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261081-ruined
