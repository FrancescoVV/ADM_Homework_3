Confessions of a Crap Artist		Philip K. Dick	3.68	4362	280	Confessions of a Crap Artist is one of Philip K. Dick's weirdest and most accomplished novels. Jack Isidore is a crap artist -- a collector of crackpot ideas (among other things, he believes that the earth is hollow and that sunlight has weight) and worthless objects, a man so grossly unequipped for real life that his sister and brother-in-law feel compelled to rescue him from it. But seen through Jack's murderously innocent gaze, Charlie and Juddy Hume prove to be just as sealed off from reality, in thrall to obsessions that are slightly more acceptable than Jack's, but a great deal uglier.	256	1975	John Isidore, Fay Hume, Charley Hume	Point Reyes Station, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65030.Confessions_of_a_Crap_Artist
