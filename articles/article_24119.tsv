Yu	4.25	1209	90	First published in 1592, The Journey to the West , volume I, comprises the first twenty-five chapters of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of Hsi-yu Chi , one of the most beloved classics of Chinese literature.

For nearly a thousand years, his exploits were celebrated and embellished in various accounts, culminating in the hundred-chapter Journey to the West , which combines religious allegory with romance, fantasy, humor, and satire.	544	January 1st 1592			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158788.The_Journey_to_the_West_Volume_1
