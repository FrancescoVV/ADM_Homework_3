Memoirs of a Space Traveler: Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy	Ijon Tichy #2	Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Joel Stern, Maria Swiecicka-Ziemianek	4.20	1020	53	Ijon Tichy is an ordinary space traveler whose extraordinary curiosity leads him to the very fringes of science. Their plans are grandiose, the bargains they make too often Faustian, for the ends these scientists pursue concern humanity's greatest and most ancient obsessions: immortality, artificial intelligence, and top-of-the-line consumer items. By turns philosophical, satirical, and absurd, Lem's stories follow Ijon's adventures as both an observer of--and participant in--strange experiments. Faulty time machines, intelligent washing machines, suicidal potatoes--Ijon Tichy navigates them all with common sense and in so doing shows why he endures as one of Lem's most popular characters.	153	1957	Ijon Tichy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88321.Memoirs_of_a_Space_Traveler
