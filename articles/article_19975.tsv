The Green Gauntlet	A Horseman Riding By #3	R.F. Delderfield	4.27	793	38	Paul and Claire Craddock had grown older in years, but not in spirit. The Second World War was over. But for Craddock and his family there were new battles to be fought and won. For the new property laws enabled speculators to reap huge profits from agricultural land, and Pauls livelihood was threatened. With the help of his children and his children's children, he struggled to preserve the happiness and peace he had built up over the years. And in doing so, he came to discover deeper, richer ties with those around him. Ties which held a ripe promise for the future.	510	1966			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/372862.The_Green_Gauntlet
