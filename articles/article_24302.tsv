Assembly of Women (Literary Classics)		Aristophanes, Robert Mayhew	3.75	894	52	The women of Athens concoct a daring scheme: penetrate the male-dominated Assembly disguised as men and vote themselves into power, after which they will overturn the old laws and inaugurate a new society where all are equal and where property and sex, too! is shared. This new translation of Aristophanes' last extant play recaptures the spirit, the bawdiness, and the brilliance of this rollicking farce, which is at the same time a profound critique of contemporary Greek customs and manners.	124	-391	Praxagora	Greece	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2018.The_Ecclesiazusae
