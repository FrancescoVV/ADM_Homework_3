Tehanu	Earthsea Cycle #4	Ursula K. Le Guin	3.93	37685	1813	Years ago, they had escaped together from the sinister Tombs of Atuanâ€”she, an isolated young priestess; he, a powerful wizard. Now she is a farmer's widow, having chosen for herself the simple pleasures of an ordinary life. And he is a broken old man, mourning the powers lost to him through no choice of his own. Once, when they were young, they helped each other at a time of darkness and danger and shared an adventure like no other. Now they must join forces again, to help another in need -- the physically and emotionally scarred child whose own destiny has yet to be revealed.	281	June 20th 1990	Ged, Tenar, Therru	Earthsea Realm	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13661.Tehanu
