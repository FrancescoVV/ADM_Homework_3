The Possibility of an Island		Michel Houellebecq	3.81	11998	711	A worldwide phenomenon and the most important French novelist since Albert Camus, Michel Houellebecq now delivers his magnum opusâ€“a tale of our present circumstances told from the future, when humanity as we know it has vanished. Surprisingly poignant, philosophically compelling, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, The Possibility of an Island is at once an indictment, an elegy, and a celebration of everything we have and are at risk of losing. It is a masterpiece from one of the world's most innovative writers.	352	August 31st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263985.The_Possibility_of_an_Island
