Emerging from Darkness	Darkness Falls #2	Kira Adams	4.47	78	39	The virus is spreading, the future is uncertain, and the Degenerates are taking control. Ike Glass and Ace Cullen have found themselves in quite the predicament: the Degenerates have located their hideout and kidnapped Phoenix and Rian, and now they must fight for their lives. Phoenix Blue knows she must tread carefully if she expects to keep her sister alive. What she doesn’t expect is the strength her young sister possesses, and the lengths her new-found family will go to in order to save their lives. Sometimes the ties that bind us have nothing to do with blood relations. Just how far will these four friends go in their quest to emerge from the darkness?
