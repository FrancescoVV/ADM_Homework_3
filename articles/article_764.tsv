The Invention of Hugo Cabret		Brian Selznick	4.22	164454	14922	Orphan, clock keeper, and thief, Hugo lives in the walls of a busy Paris train station, where his survival depends on secrets and anonymity. But when his world suddenly interlocks with an eccentric, bookish girl and a bitter old man who runs a toy booth in the station, Hugo's undercover life, and his most precious secret, are put in jeopardy. A cryptic drawing, a treasured notebook, a stolen key, a mechanical man, and a hidden message from Hugo's dead father form the backbone of this intricate, tender, and spellbinding mystery.	533	March 2007	Hugo Cabret, George Méliès, Isabelle	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9673436-the-invention-of-hugo-cabret
