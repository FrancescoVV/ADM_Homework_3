Elsewhere		Gabrielle Zevin	3.90	50414	5264	Welcome to Elsewhere. It is warm, with a breeze, and the beaches are marvelous. It's quiet and peaceful. You can't get sick or any older. Curious to see new paintings by Picasso? Swing by one of Elsewhere's museums. Need to talk to someone about your problems? Stop by Marilyn Monroe's psychiatric practice. Elsewhere is where fifteen-year-old Liz Hall ends up, after she has died. It is a place so like Earth, yet completely different. Here Liz will age backward from the day of her death until she becomes a baby again and returns to Earth. But Liz wants to turn sixteen, not fourteen again. She wants to get her driver's license. She wants to graduate from high school and go to college. And now that she's dead, Liz is being forced to live a life she doesn't want with a grandmother she has only just met. And it is not going well. How can Liz let go of the only life she has ever known and embrace a new one? Is it possible that a life lived in reverse is no different from a life lived forward? This moving, often funny book about grief, death, and loss will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.	277	September 9th 2005	Elizabeth Marie Hall, Thandiwe Washington, Betty Bloom, Curtis Jest, Aldous Ghent, Olivia Bloom Hall, Lucy, Alvy Hall, Coco, Captain Welles, Florence, Doris, Myrna, Mrs. Early, Reginald Christopher Doral Monmount Harris the Third, Owen Welles, Emily Reilly Welles, Josh, Shelly, Dr. Frederick, Phyllis, Zooey Ann Brandon, Yetta Brown, Rowena Ghent, Sarah Miles, Esther, Arthur Hall, Edward, Dr. Fujiyama, Arnold, Amadou Bonamy, Josey Wu, Sadie, Jen, Paco, Pete, Beneatha, Allie Reilly, Joe, Owen, Dolly, Paul Scott Spencer		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359410.Elsewhere
