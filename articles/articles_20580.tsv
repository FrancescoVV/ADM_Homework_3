Darkest Day	The 19th Year #3	Emi Gayle	4.01	136	22	Mac Thorne’s time as a Changeling is coming to an end. It may have taken eighteen years, but Mac did finally manage to do what the Council wanted: she chose a teacher and renounced the in-between. There’s just one last step. She must say goodbye to her human. Forever. After being challenged in every way possible, Mac leaves what she thought would be the easiest task for the last possible moment. As midnight on July fourth draws near, though, she hasn’t found a way to give up Winn Thomas. Nor does she want to. With time running out, Mac stands at a literal crossroads. Choose Winn, and she’ll be stripped of the only family she’s ever known — vampires, dragons, and her favorite demon. Even her own mother. Accept her position on the Council and rule as an equal to her twelve peers, and she’ll forget Winn ever existed. Independence and freedom have never before been so limiting. In this final chapter of the 19th Year Trilogy, it’s time for Mac to decide. Responsibility? Or Love?		December 16th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13348349-darkest-day
