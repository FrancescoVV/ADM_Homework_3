Aeriel’s people have assembled an army--led by the redeemed darkangel Irrylath--and are soon to attack the Witch and her darkangel sons. But their cause is hopeless unless Aeriel can unlock the mysteries of the pearl . . . and of her own destiny.	322	1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92719.The_Pearl_of_the_Soul_of_the_World
