Embracing The Falls	The Falls Trilogy   #3	Heather  Renee	4.71	80	29	Rebellious animals have threatened Strix's realm and Kali is determined to help him reclaim his home. There's only one problem... she's eight months pregnant. As Kali battles Lucas and her family's disapproval, help comes from unexpected places. When Otherworld allies pledge their assistance, her friends and family reluctantly agree to accompany her to Dásos, Strix's world, in hopes of resolving the rebels' complaints peacefully. Their journey to Dásos makes one thing clear. There is far more behind the sudden change in the creatures inhabiting the land. Nothing is as it seems, and Kali will have to overcome more than she's prepared for. As darkness encroaches upon the Elders, it will be up to each of them to embrace the light before its too late.	264	December 29th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36559425-embracing-the-falls
