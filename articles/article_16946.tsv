I Had Brain Surgery, What's Your Excuse?		Suzy Becker	3.79	448	57	For years Suzy Becker, author of The New York Times bestseller All I Need to Know I Learned from My Cat , literally lived by her wits--her imagination, intelligence, ideas, passion. During much of that time she was also suffering seizures. But they came secretly in the middle of the night, and were probably stress-related, or so one doctor said. Then a seizure (and a second opinion) led to a round of specialists, Cat scans, MRIs, and-Suzy's worst fears come true--brain surgery. An inspiring memoir, I Had Brain Surgery, What's Your Excuse? is a story of identity told with wise, surprising humor. It takes readers on a journey that's both metaphysical and whimsical; one that is by turns rivetingly dramatic and unexpectedly light. Illustrated with drawings, charts, newspaper clippings, silly graphs, and real EEGs and MRIs, I Had Brain Surgery . . . turns one artist's story into a universal book about creativity, family, healing, love, commitment, and that intangible something that gives each of us our spark.	256	December 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/765763.I_Had_Brain_Surgery_What_s_Your_Excuse_
