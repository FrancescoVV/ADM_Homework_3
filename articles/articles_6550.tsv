A Yellow Raft in Blue Water		Michael Dorris	3.86	16957	976	Michael Dorris has crafted a fierce saga of three generations of Indian women, beset by hardships and torn by angry secrets, yet inextricably joined by the bonds of kinship. Starting in the present day and moving backward, the novel is told in the voices of the three women: fifteen-year-old part-black Rayona; her American Indian mother, Christine, consumed by tenderness and resentment toward those she loves; and the fierce and mysterious Ida, mother and grandmother whose haunting secrets, betrayals, and dreams echo through the years, braiding together the strands of the shared past.	372	January 1st 1987		Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17174.A_Yellow_Raft_in_Blue_Water
