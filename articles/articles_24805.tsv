Five 4ths of July		Pat Raccio Hughes	3.88	153	41	On July 4th, 1777, Jake Mallory and his friends are celebrating their new nation's independence in a small coastal town in Connecticut. Fourteen-yearold Jake wants nothing more than to get out from under the strict thumb of his father and see some adventure. But he learns too late that he must be careful what he wishes for. Over the course of four more 4ths, he finds himself in increasingly adventurous circumstances-from battling the British army to barely surviving on a prison ship to finally returning home, war-torn and weary, but hopeful for his and America's future.	288	May 12th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8610438-five-4ths-of-july
