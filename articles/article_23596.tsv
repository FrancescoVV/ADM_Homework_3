The White Rose: Munich, 1942-1943		Inge Scholl, Dorothee SÃ¶lle, Inge Aicher-Scholl	3.93	1220	97	The White Rose tells the story of Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl, who in 1942 led a small underground organization of German students and professors to oppose the atrocities committed by Hitler and the Nazi Party. They named their group the White Rose, and they distributed leaflets denouncing the Nazi regime. Sophie, Hans, and a third student were caught and executed. Written by Inge Scholl (Han's and Sophie's sister), The White Rose features letters, diary excerpts, photographs of Hans and Sophie, transcriptions of the leaflets, and accounts of the trial and execution. This is a gripping account of courage and morality. CONTRIBUTORS: Dorthe Solle.	176	1952			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257140.The_White_Rose
