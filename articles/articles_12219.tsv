Preacher, Volume 1: Gone to Texas	Preacher #1	Garth Ennis, Steve Dillon, Joe R. Lansdale	4.15	67285	1664	One of the most celebrated comics titles of the late 1990s, PREACHER is a modern American epic of life, death, love and redemption also packed with sex, booze, blood and bullets - not to mention angels, demons, God, vampires and deviants of all stripes. At first glance, the Reverend Jesse Custer doesn't look like anyone special-just another small-town minister slowly losing his flock and his faith. But he's about to come face-to-face with proof that God does indeed exist. Merging with a bizarre spiritual force called Genesis, Jesse now possesses the power of "the Word," an ability to make people do whatever he utters. He begins a violent and riotous journey across the country in search of answers from the elusive deity. This volume collects issues #1-7 of the series.	336	1995	Jesse Custer, Saint of Killers, Tulip	New York City, New York (United States), Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95431.Preacher_Volume_1
