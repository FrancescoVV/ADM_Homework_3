You Against Me		Jenny Downham	3.70	17983	1444	If someone hurts your sister and you're any kind of man, you seek revenge, right? If your brother's accused of a terrible crime but says he didn't do it, you defend him, don't you? When Mikey's sister claims a boy assaulted her, his world begins to fall apart. When Ellie's brother is charged with the offence, her world begins to unravel. When Mikey and Ellie meet, two worlds collide. This is a brave and unflinching novel from the bestselling author of Before I Die . It's a book about loyalty and the choices that come with it. But above all it's a book about love.	413	December 2nd 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8720917-you-against-me
