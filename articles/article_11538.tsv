The Only Wise God: The Compatibility of Divine Foreknowledge & Human Freedom		William Lane Craig	4.26	223	27	Does God know our actions before we do them? And if so, do human beings truly have free will? Dr. Craig contends that both of these notions are compatible, showing how the Bible teaches divine foreknowledge of human free acts, and reveals two ways of "reconciling divine omniscience with human freedom".	160	January 13th 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455525.The_Only_Wise_God
