Sundays at Tiffany's		James Patterson, Gabrielle Charbonnet	3.77	65453	6130	As a little girl, Jane has no one. Her mother, the powerful head of a Broadway theater company, has no time for her. She does have one friend-a handsome, comforting, funny man named Michael-but only she can see him. Years later, Jane is in her thirties and just as alone as ever. Then she meets Michael again-as handsome, smart and perfect as she remembers him to be. But not even Michael knows the reason they've really been reunited. SUNDAYS AT TIFFANY'S is a love story with an irresistible twist, a novel about the child inside all of us-and the boundary-crossing power of love.	309	January 1st 2008	Michael (angel), Jane Margaux, Vivienne Margaux	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2029177.Sundays_at_Tiffany_s
