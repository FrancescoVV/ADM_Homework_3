The End	The Enemy #7	Charlie Higson	4.46	2368	258	The end is coming. The sickness struck everyone sixteen and older. First it twisted their minds; next it ravaged their bodies. Now the sickos—crazed and hungry for young flesh—are gathered in the center of London, lying in wait. It’s time for all of the survivors—kids spread out across the city—to unite. They must come up with a plan of attack to end the grown-ups’ reign of terror before it is too late. One thing is certain: surprises abound in the bloody conclusion to Charlie Higson’s Enemy saga.	454	November 3rd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20550280-the-end
