Alpha & Omega	Alpha & Omega #0.5	Patricia Briggs	4.29	21331	1141	In Cry Wolf , New York Times bestselling author Patricia Briggs started a new urban fantasy series set in the world of Mercy Thompson — but with rules of its own. Now, read "Alpha and Omega," the novella that inspired the new series, and see how it all began... Anna Latham never knew werewolves existed, until the night she survived a violent attack... and became one herself. After three years at the bottom of the Chicago pack, she's learned to keep her head down and never, ever trust dominant males. But when she discovers wrongdoing in her pack, she has to go above her Alpha's head to ask for help. Charles Cornick is the son — and enforcer — of the leader of the North American werewolves. Now his father has sent him to Chicago to clean up a problem there. Charles never expected to find Anna, a rare Omega wolf — and he certainly never expected to recognize her as his mate... This novella was originally published in the anthology, On the Prowl.	61	August 7th 2007	Charles Cornick, Anna Latham, Bran "The Marrok" Cornick, Leo (Chicago Alpha)	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5393637-alpha-omega
