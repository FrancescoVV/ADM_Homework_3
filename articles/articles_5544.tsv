A Butler Christmas	Naim Butler #1	Rahiem Brooks	4.53	34	15	"Brooksâ€™s clunky first Naim Butler contemporary romantic thriller has strong characters...The well-developed relationships among the characters propel the story until the addition of suspense very late in the book..."--Publishers Weekly Naim Butler, a rainmaker, has perfected the art of sentencing mitigation, as a partner with Manhattan power-firm, Baker and Keefe. He's the kind of captivating and accomplished man that therapists vent too. His bachelorhood is turned upside down when an old flame, Sinia Love, drops a seventeen-year-old son into his lap forcing him to balance this revelation and his budding romance with Brandy Scott. Professionally, Naim's assigned to prove a man's innocence of murder is filthy work itself, but catastrophic when an envious lover of Sinia Love's sets out to kill him while hiding amongst the glitterati of Manhattan's upper crust.	278	December 5th 2017		New York City's Upper East Side (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35295478-a-butler-christmas
