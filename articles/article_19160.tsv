The Realm of Radiance: A Modern Fable		Jonathan Eli Herrick	4.67	3	2	This enchanting modern fable follows in the tradition of The Alchemist , The Celestine Prophecy , and The Little Prince . Jonah, a shy 17-year old tormented by loss, is obsessed with a search for love and mystical wisdom. From his home on an isolated island in the north Atlantic, he begins a passionate journey filled with life-threatening adventure, incandescent romance, and True Magic. As Jonah flees unspeakable perils and chases his dream, he encounters a haunting young sorceress, a mind-blowing trickster Wizard and a rogue, spiritual master. They, and others, lead him ever further beyond the ordinary and deeper into the world of mystery. The author's own life stories and wide-ranging experiences in Eastern mystical traditions inspired the novel. The book also includes a dozen lyrical illustrations by Andrea Leljak. Jonathan and his sorceress wife live in San Francisco and on California's Central Coast with a wise calico cat and a shamanic mutt who are head over paws in love with each other. Jonathan and his wife also have three wonderful adult children and don't get to see enough of them.		August 16th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35969545-the-realm-of-radiance
