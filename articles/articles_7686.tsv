The Strange Power	Dark Visions #1	L.J. Smith	3.81	6701	245	They said she had evil eyes... Eyes that saw what was not meant to be seen. Kaitlyn Fairchild was frightened by her uncanny talent, by the prophetic drawings that isolated her at school. Until she was invited to California, to attend the Zetes institute with four other psychically gifted students, in return for a college scholarship. It was a chance to begin again, to belong; a great adventure, with the promise of romance...with Rob, irresistible, yet strangely innocent...with dark, enigmatic Gabriel. Until they learn the truth about an experiment that threatens their sanity, and their lives. All they have is each other, and a perilous psychic link that can save - or destroy - them all...	230	December 1st 1994	Rob Kessler, Kaitlyn Fairchild, Lewis Chao, Gabriel Wolfe, Anna Whiteraven		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/258468.The_Strange_Power
