Deep Water		Patricia Highsmith	3.81	2988	310	In Deep Water , set in the quiet, small town of Little Wesley, Patricia Highsmith has created a vicious and suspenseful tale of love gone sour. Vic and Melinda Van Allen's loveless marriage is held together only by a precarious arrangement whereby, in order to avoid the messiness of divorce, Melinda is allowed to take any number of lovers as long as she does not desert her family. Eventually, Vic can no longer suppress his jealousy and tries to win back his wife by asserting himself through a tall tale of murderâ€”one that soon comes true. In this complex portrayal of a dangerous psychosis emerging in the most unlikely of places, Highsmith examines the chilling reality behind the idyllic facade of American suburban life.	271	1957	Vic Van Allen, Melinda Van Allen, Trixie Van Allen, Charley De Lisle, Tony Cameron, Ralph Gosden, Don Wilson	New England (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/427281.Deep_Water
