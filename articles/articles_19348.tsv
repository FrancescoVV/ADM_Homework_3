What They Asked Me: The Fear of Living and Dying Young		Mwanandeke Kindembo	5.00	2	2	This small book was written by Mr. Mwanandeke Kindembo. The author focused on answering some crucial questions asked by different people. Therefore, he decided to combine all the minds into One by giving general answers upon each question posed. These answers are his own opinions based upon what he experienced in life. In other words, “feel think” instead of “think feel”. These answers were provided to act as motivational as well as illuminating the minds instead of arousing only. It is unknown whether he is a naturalist, idealist or realist. But the answers seem to offer that first-hand experience instead of mere facts that doesn’t lead anywhere. It’s given therefore upon the reader to decide on his/her own conclusion of this little book of questionnaires. Instead of focusing on the famous sentence “arise, ye who are dead”. The author focused more upon “ye who are alive, arise!” That’s the primary cause of the sub-title “The Fear of Living and Dying Young.” ==================Table of Contents==================== What They Asked Me 1 The Fear of Living and Dying Young 1 About the Author 3 Contents 4 Illustrations 5 Introduction 7 Questions & Answers 10 Happiness 12 Knowledge Seeking 20 Self-Realisation 41 Life Advice 50 Success 67 Philosophy 73 Psychology 77 Motivation 93 Mind 109 Finance 118 History 120 Religion 124 Summary 138	139	September 21st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48660853-what-they-asked-me
