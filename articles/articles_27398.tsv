Berserk, Vol. 6	ベルセルク / Berserk #6	Kentaro Miura, Duane Johnson	4.56	4499	113	Back in the day, Guts the Black Swordsman was a top slayer for The Band of the Hawk, an elite mercenary unit led by Griffith, whose calm demeanor and callow beauty belied his fighting prowess and steel will. While in a king's employ, the attraction between the king's daughter and Griffith and the growing favor of the king towards the Hawk leader raises the hackles of the king's jealous brother, who plots to have Griffith summarily assassinated. But if the plot fails, the king's brother will likely have to deal with Guts and his titanic broadsword, and the results of such confrontations are rarely pretty... or easy to clean up.	223	September 30th 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248884.Berserk_Vol_6
