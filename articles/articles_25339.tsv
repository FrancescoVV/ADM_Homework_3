Through a Mother's Eyes		Cary Allen Stone	3.43	334	31	A chilling look at human nature in a context where the lines between right and wrong become sadly blurred. It’s a compelling account of one woman's life, and what drove her to take the life of her six-year-old son. How everyday choices shape our perceptions, justifications, and actions. One must consider how close to the edge we all are. It’s a true story told in layman’s terms, with the hope of preventing another tragic loss.	140	October 7th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53255731-through-a-mother-s-eyes
