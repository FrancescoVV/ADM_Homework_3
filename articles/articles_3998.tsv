Presumed Innocent	Kindle County Legal Thriller #1	Scott Turow	4.10	107113	1554	Hailed as the most suspenseful and compelling novel in decades. Presumed Innocent brings to life our worst nightmare: that of an ordinary citizen facing conviction for the most terrible of all crimes. It's the stunning portrayal of one man's all-too-human, all-consuming fatal attraction for a passionate woman who is not his wife, and the story of how his obsession puts everything he loves and values on trialâ€”including his own life. It's a book that lays bare a shocking world of betrayal and murder, as well as the hidden depths of the human heart. And it will hold you and haunt you ... long after you have reached its shattering conclusion.	421	December 31st 1986	Rusty Sabich, Alejandro "Sandy" Stern		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425029.Presumed_Innocent
