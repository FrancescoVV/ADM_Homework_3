300	300 Universe #1	Frank Miller, Lynn Varley	3.95	44584	930	The armies of Persia -- a vast horde greater than any the world has ever known -- are poised to crush Greece, an island of reason and freedom in a sea of madness and tyranny. Standing between Greece and this tidal wave of destruction are a tiny detachment of but three hundred warriors. Frank Miller's epic retelling of history's supreme moment of battlefield valor is finally collected in a glorious hardcover volume in its intended format -- each two-page spread from the original comics is presented as a single undivided page. Collects: 300 #1-5	88	December 28th 1999	Leonidas, Xerxes I of Persia		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59952.300
