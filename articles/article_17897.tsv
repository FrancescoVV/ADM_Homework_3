Adam	Adam #1	Anthony McDonald	3.99	274	24	Adam is the 16-year-old most parents would love to have: he doesn't do drugs, comes top at school and regularly practices his cello. But there is another side to him, which comes to the fore when he falls for laborer Sylvain and gets sexually involved with two friends. The results are explosive in this passionate story of illicit romance and teenage angst-a combination that is eternally popular with gay readers.	300	August 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1708541.Adam
