Les Liaisons dangereuses		Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, Douglas Parmée	4.07	43572	1543	The complex moral ambiguities of seduction and revenge make Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782) one of the most scandalous and controversial novels in European literature. The subject of major film and stage adaptations, the novel's prime movers, the Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteuil, form an unholy alliance and turn seduction into a game - a game which they must win. This new translation gives Laclos a modern voice, and readers will be able a judge whether the novel is as "diabolical" and "infamous" as its critics have claimed, or whether it has much to tell us about the kind of world we ourselves live in. David Coward's introduction explodes myths about Laclos's own life and puts the book in its literary and cultural context.	448	March 24th 1782	Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil, Vicomte Sébastien de Valmont, Madame de Tourvel, Madame de Volanges, Le Chevalier Raphael Danceny, Madame de Rosemonde, Cécile de Volanges	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49540.Les_Liaisons_dangereuses
