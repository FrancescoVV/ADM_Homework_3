Too Consumed	Consumed #2	Skyla Madi	4.22	7115	332	Olivia did the impossible. She tamed the over-confident Casanova, Seth Marc, turning him into a one woman Romeo. With Seth's first professional fight coming up, she does her best to keep him focused and driven... even if that means withholding sex from him. As sexual tensions rise, so do past discrepancies the couple thought buried, putting extra stress on both their romantic and professional lives. Stuck in the center of the action, Olivia and Seth fight for air as they collide face first with the tough world of professional MMA.	313	January 2nd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18482979-too-consumed
