At the Back of the North Wind		George MacDonald, Arthur Hughes	3.98	6446	486	Diamond, son of a poor coachman, is swept away by the North Wind -- a radiant, maternal spirit with long, flowing hair. His life is transformed by a brief glimpse of the beautiful country -- at the back of the north wind. This Victorian fairy tale has enchanted readers for more than a hundred years, and combines a Dickensian regard for the working class of mid-19th-century England with the invention of an ethereal landscape.	346	1871	Diamond		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/269713.At_the_Back_of_the_North_Wind
