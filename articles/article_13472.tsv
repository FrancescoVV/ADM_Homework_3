Sapphire Battersea	Hetty Feather #2	Jacqueline Wilson	4.23	3739	199	A fascinating, funny and moving Victorian novel featuring Hetty Feather. Hetty Feather was just a baby when her mother left her at the Foundling Hospital. Hetty longed to find her real mum -- and finally her wish was granted. But just as they have found each other, they are separated again, as Hetty leaves the home to become a maid of all work to Mr Buchanan. Set in London in the 1870s, this sequel to Hetty Feather is a wonderfully evocative and original historical novel, perfect for girls of eight and older.	400	September 29th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10751324-sapphire-battersea
