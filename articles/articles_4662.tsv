The Rise of Nazil: Complete Epic Fantasy Trilogy: Gritty Epic Fantasy		Aaron-Michael Hall	4.18	268	6	INTERNATIONAL EPIC FANTASY AWARD-WINNER Before Nazil’s rise ...came its destruction . The liberation of a world ignited the Zon’tul demon’s hunger to consume it. The battles fought in The Rise of Nazil were the presage of an impending war. A war not for land, wealth, or power, but for the fate of the mortal world which hung tethered to a brittle filament, separating the Nether from the mortal. As the gods continued to weaken, the demons began their rise. What began with Mah’saahc’s awakening in Seed of Scorn , crept across Faélondul, devouring and possessing the souls of men, incessantly seeking the Blood of Oisin needed to breach the threshold between realms. The sacrifices and bonds that once held the Benoists’ together could be the catalyst which tears them apart. The darkness is coming, and once the sides are chosen, neither can win...without dying. If you love the intrigue and treachery of George R.R. Martin, the epic battles and characterization of R.A. Salvatore, and the exceptional world-building, politics, and magical systems of Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, The Rise of Nazil trilogy will captivate you from start to finish. Step away from the ordinary and immerse yourself in a unique and enthralling diverse epic fantasy.
