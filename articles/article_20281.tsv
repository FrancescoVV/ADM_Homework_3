Mr. Darcy Presents His Bride: A Sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice		Helen Halstead	3.57	1780	182	IN PRIDE & PREJUDICE , JANE AUSTEN brought together one of the most beloved literary couples of all time—Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. Now, Mr. Darcy Presents His Bride continues the story of these passion-filled newlyweds as they enter London’s glamorous high society. This page-turning novel finds Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy entangled in the frivolity and ferocity of social intrigues. Although Elizabeth makes a powerful friend in the Marchioness of Englebury, the rivalry and jealousy among her ladyship’s prestigious clique threatens to destroy the success of her new marriage. Written in the style of Jane Austen, full of humor and sardonic wit, Mr. Darcy Presents His Bride brings Regency society vividly to life and continues the romantic, sometimes tragic, stories of other popular Pride & Prejudice characters including Georgiana Darcy and Kitty Bennet.	320	January 1st 2004	Elizabeth Bennet, Fitzwilliam Darcy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74788.Mr_Darcy_Presents_His_Bride
