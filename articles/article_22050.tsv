The Wayward Bus		John Steinbeck, Gary Scharnhorst, Nils Holmberg	3.85	9147	643	In his first novel to follow the publication of his enormous success, The Grapes of Wrath , Steinbeck’s vision comes to life in this imaginative and unsentimental chronicle of a bus traveling California’s back roads, transporting the lost and the lonely, the good and the greedy, the stupid and the scheming, the beautiful and the vicious away from their shattered dreams and, possibly, toward the promise of the future. This edition features an introduction by Gary Scharnhorst.	261	February 1947	Norma, Juan Chicoy, Alice Chicoy, Pimples, Elliott Pritchard, Bernice Pritchard, Mildred Pritchard, Ernest Horton, Camille Oaks	Rebel Corners (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78275.The_Wayward_Bus
