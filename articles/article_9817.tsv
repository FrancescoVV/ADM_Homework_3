The Bar Code Tattoo	Bar Code #1	Suzanne Weyn	3.55	16340	1464	The bar code tattoo. Everybody's getting it. It will make your life easier, they say. It will hook you in. It will become your identity. But what if you say no? What if you don't want to become a code? For Kayla, this one choice changes everything. She becomes an outcast in her high school. Dangerous things happen to her family. There's no option but to run . . . for her life. Individuality vs. conformity. Identity vs. access. Freedom vs. control. The bar code tattoo.	250	September 2004	Kayla Reed		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/592089.The_Bar_Code_Tattoo
