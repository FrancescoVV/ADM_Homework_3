Don Juan		Lord Byron, Truman Guy Steffan, Peter J. Manning, Susan J. Wolfson	3.80	7508	253	Probably few subjects fitted Byron's particular talents better than Don Juan. In this rambling, exuberant, conversational poem, the travels of Don Juan are used as a vehicle for some of the most lively and acute commentaries on human societies and behaviour in the language. The manner is what Goethe called 'a cultured comic language'-a genre which he regarded as not possible in Geman and which he felt Byron managed superbly.	584	1819			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78249.Don_Juan
