Maid-sama! Vol. 01	Maid Sama! #1	Hiro Fujiwara	4.42	47141	550	Misaki Ayuzawa is the President of the Student Council at Seika High School, formerly an all-boys school. Unfortunately, most of the students are still male and stuck in their slovenly habits, so man-hating Misaki really socks it to them in an attempt to make the school presentable to attract more female students. But what will she do when the sexiest boy in school finds out that after school, Misaki works in a maid cafe. First published in Japan in 2006 by Hakusensha Inc., Tokyo.	208	September 5th 2006	Misaki Ayuzawa, Takumi Usui		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6081685-maid-sama-vol-01
