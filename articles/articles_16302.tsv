Skeleton Creek	Skeleton Creek #1	Patrick Carman	4.07	7066	1184	A breakthrough new series from bestselling author Patrick Carman, featuring text and technology in an innovative new way. Strange things are happening in Skeleton Creek... and Ryan and Sarah are trying to get to the heart of it. But after an eerie accident leaves Ryan housebound and forbidden to see Sarah, their investigation takes two tracks: Ryan records everything in his journal, while Sarah uses her videocam to search things out... and then email the clips for Ryan to see. In a new, groundbreaking format, the story is broken into two parts â€” Ryan's text in the book, and Sarah's videos on a special website, with links and passwords given throughout the book.	185	March 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55352527-skeleton-creek
