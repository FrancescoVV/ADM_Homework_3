Inherit the Wind		Jerome Lawrence, Robert E.  Lee	3.96	20261	835	A meaningful play based on the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, in which a Tennessee teacher was tried for teaching evolution. The accused was a slight, frightened man who'd deliberately broken the law. His trial was a Roman circus, the chief gladiators being the two great legal giants of the century. Locked in mortal combat, they bellowed & roared imprecations & abuse. The spectators sat uneasily in the sweltering heat with murder in their hearts, barely restraining themselves. America's freedom was at stake.	144	1955	Matthew Harrison Brady, Henry Drummond, Bertram Cates, E.K. Hornbeck	United States of America, Hillsboro, Tennessee	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253264.Inherit_the_Wind
