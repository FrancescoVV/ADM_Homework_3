The Case of the Bizarre Bouquets	Enola Holmes #3	Nancy Springer, Peter Ferguson	4.11	4804	441	Everyone knows Dr. Watson is Sherlock Holmes' right-hand man - so when he goes missing, it's a shock. Even Sherlock hasn't, well, the slightest clue as to where he could be. Enola is intrigued, but weary; she's still hiding from her older brothers - and getting involved could be disastrous. But when a bizarre bouquet shows up at the Watson residence, full of convolvulus, hawthorn, and white poppies, Enola must act. She dons her most discerning disguise yet to find the sender - and quickly, for Enola knows the blossoms symbolize death! Hold your breath, because Enola's about to take it away. The stakes are higher and the mystery deeper than ever before in this third installment of this Edgar Award nominated, critically acclaimed series.	170	2008	Enola Holmes, Mrs. Mary Watson, Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1102814.The_Case_of_the_Bizarre_Bouquets
