Secret Daughter		Shilpi Somaya Gowda	3.98	69099	5485	Somer's life is everything she imagined it would be — she's newly married and has started her career as a physician in San Francisco — until she makes the devastating discovery she never will be able to have children. The same year in India, a poor mother makes the heartbreaking choice to save her newborn daughter's life by giving her away. It is a decision that will haunt Kavita for the rest of her life, and cause a ripple effect that travels across the world and back again. Asha, adopted out of a Mumbai orphanage, is the child that binds the destinies of these two women. We follow both families, invisibly connected until Asha's journey of self-discovery leads her back to India. Compulsively readable and deeply touching, SECRET DAUGHTER is a story of the unforeseen ways in which our choices and families affect our lives, and the indelible power of love in all its many forms.	339	March 9th 2010	Kavita Merchant, Jasu Merchant, Asha Thakkar, Krishnan (Kris) Thakkar, Somer (Whitman) Thakkar, Sarla Thakkar		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6905012-secret-daughter
