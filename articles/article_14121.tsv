Road of the Patriarch	The Sellswords #3	R.A. Salvatore	4.19	7476	111	To her, to her dying breath, you were the untouchable one, the one whose flesh her dagger could not penetrate. THE ASSASSIN A cold and emotionless killer for whom every soul has a price, even his own, embarks on a path to find out just how high that price can be. THE MERCENARY A dark elf of limitless guile dares to challenge a king, and carve for himself a place in the inhospitable World Above. ILNEZHARA and TAZMIKELLA are ancient dragons of great power, accustomed to easily manipulating the humans around them. But not all humans are so easily led. When they pushed Entreri and Jarlaxle into the heart of the Bloodstone Lands, not even they could have imagined the strength of the human assassin’s resolve, or the limitless expanse of the drow mercenary’s ambition.	346	2006	Artemis Entreri, Jarlaxle		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6291.Road_of_the_Patriarch
