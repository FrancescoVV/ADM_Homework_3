Poison Study	Poison Study #1	Maria V. Snyder	4.11	143834	11784	Choose: A quick death… or slow poison... About to be executed for murder, Yelena is offered an extraordinary reprieve. She'll eat the best meals, have rooms in the palace—and risk assassination by anyone trying to kill the Commander of Ixia. And so Yelena chooses to become a food taster. But the chief of security, leaving nothing to chance, deliberately feeds her Butterfly's Dust—and only by appearing for her daily antidote will she delay an agonizing death from the poison. As Yelena tries to escape her new dilemma, disasters keep mounting. Rebels plot to seize Ixia and Yelena develops magical powers she can't control. Her life is threatened again and choices must be made. But this time the outcomes aren't so clear...	427	September 27th 2005	Valek, Maren, Commander Ambrose, Janco, Yelena Zaltana, Ari, Rand, General Brazell	Ixia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60510.Poison_Study
