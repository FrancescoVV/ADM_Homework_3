In Good Faith	Joe Dillard #2	Scott Pratt	4.08	16740	670	A family of four is slaughtered in rural Tennessee. Two weeks later, a retired high school principal and his wife are brutally slain. Two Satan-worshipping teens stand accused. Itâ€™s up to prosecutor Joe Dillard to convict them. A former defense attorney who spent way too much time defending people he knew were guilty, Joe is determined to win this case to atone for his past. But an evil young woman named Natasha is responsible for the slayings and Joe knows it. Natasha is walking around free because the two boys who have been arrested are too terrified to implicate her. Now Joe must risk everything -- including his family's safety and his own life -- to bring an evil murderer to justice. "This book was so intense it was scary." -- M. Cottrill, Dallas, Tex. "The book ends up moving along like a thriller should; at breakneck speed." -- N. Bilmes, Vernon, Conn. "This author is a must read if you love attorney and courtroom thrillers." -- Kenneth J. George, Detroit, Mich. " Better than the old Grisham." -- Tompat, Melbourne, Fla.	384	April 2nd 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16124802-in-good-faith
