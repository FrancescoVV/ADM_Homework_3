Stay Out of the Basement	Goosebumps #2	R.L. Stine	3.67	16551	760	Dr. Brewer is doing a little plant-testing in his basement. Nothing to worry about. Harmless, he says. But Margaret and Casey Brewer are worried about their father. Especially when they...meet...some of the plants he is growing down there. Then they notice that their father is developing plant like tendencies. In fact, he is becoming distinctly weedy-and seedy. Is it just part of Dr. Brewer's 'harmless' experiment? Or does Dad have more than just a green thumb...?	144	July 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125542.Stay_Out_of_the_Basement
