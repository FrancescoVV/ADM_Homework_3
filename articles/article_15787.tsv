First Blood: A Kaden Bonus Book		Synne Jakobsen	4.61	28	1	No one looked after him, talked to him, or even gave him a second glance. He didn’t know where he came from and he didn’t really care. For as long as Kaden could remember, he didn't belong to any pack—and he preferred it that way. But one day, he meets a young alpha who decides to take him in and inadvertently unleashes his thirst for blood and violence. Will he decide to stick to a pack and let his loyalty be tied down? Or will he still choose the life of a rogue?	14	July 23rd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25986670-first-blood
