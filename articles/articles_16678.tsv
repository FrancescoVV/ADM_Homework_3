Confessions of a Triple Shot Betty	Triple Shot Bettys #1	Jody Gehrman	3.74	2788	230	Geena can't wait to spend summer vacation with her two best girls: her friend Amber and her cousin Hero. All three are working at the Triple Shot Betty coffee shop together, but the moment Amber and Hero meet, the claws come out. They hate each other on sight. Geena's dream of a girl-bonding summer flies out of the window, and then threaten to disappear completely when a few cute (okay, drop-dead gorgeous) guys come along to woo the Bettys. But all is not what it seems, and in a story of mistaken identities, crazy summer high jinks, and enough romance to make Shakespeare proud, Geena and her friends learn that when Bettys unite, they can take on the most powerful force in their world: a hot guy.	255	April 17th 2008	Ben, Hero (Much ado), Geena, Amber		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1248692.Confessions_of_a_Triple_Shot_Betty
