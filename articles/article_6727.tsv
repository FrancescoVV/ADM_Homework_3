The Floating Opera and The End of the Road		John Barth	4.02	1989	118	The Floating Opera and The End Of The Road are John Barth's first two novels. Their relationship to each other is evident not only in their ribald subject matter but in the eccentric characters and bitterly humorous tone of the narratives. Both concern strange, consuming love triangles and the destructive effect of an overactive intellect on the emotions. Separately they give two very different views of a universal human drama.	442	1958			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24836.The_Floating_Opera_and_The_End_of_the_Road
