When she was a little girl her father was heartlessly killed because he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even though she had prayed to God to save him her prayers were ignored and her father died right in front of her, thus causing her to abandon everything that she had once believed in. Now she is a grown woman who discovers to her surprise that she is pregnant, only the father turns out to be somebody whom she would never suspect and that personâ€™s son is destined to bring about an age undreamed of. Only now, a crazed madman is trying to kill her before such a thing can happen while another fights to see that new day come, both of whom are soldiers of God. While the two of them are on the run they begin to fall in love as they live for the day when the King of Kings will walk the earth once again.	372	August 19th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158340-immaculate
