Gravity's Rainbow		Thomas Pynchon	3.97	38884	3205	Winner of the 1973 National Book Award, Gravity's Rainbow is a postmodern epic, a work as exhaustively significant to the second half of the 20th century as Joyce's Ulysses was to the first. Its sprawling, encyclopedic narrative, and penetrating analysis of the impact of technology on society make it an intellectual tour de force.	776	February 28th 1973	Lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop, Pig Bodine		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415.Gravity_s_Rainbow
