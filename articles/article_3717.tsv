Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?		Edward Albee	4.08	59870	1569	"Twelve times a week," answered Uta Hagen when asked how often she'd like to play Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? In the same way, audiences and critics alike could not get enough of Edward Albee's masterful play. A dark comedy, it portrays husband and wife George and Martha in a searing night of dangerous fun and games. By the evening's end, a stunning, almost unbearable revelation provides a climax that has shocked audiences for years. With the play's razor-sharp dialogue and the stripping away of social pretense, Newsweek rightly foresaw Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as "a brilliantly original work of art--an excoriating theatrical experience, surging with shocks of recognition and dramatic fire [that] will be igniting Broadway for some time to come."	272	January 1st 1962	George (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf), Martha (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf), Nick (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf), Honey (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf)	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14940.Who_s_Afraid_of_Virginia_Woolf_
