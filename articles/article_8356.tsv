Mysteries		Knut Hamsun	4.08	5650	392	In a Norwegian coastal town, society's carefully woven threads begin to unravel when an unsettling stranger named Johan Nagel arrives. With an often brutal insight into human nature, Nagel draws out the townsfolk, exposing their darkest instincts and suppressed desires. At once arrogant and unassuming, righteous and depraved, Nagel's bizarre behavior and feverish rants seduces the entire community even as he turns it on its headâ€”before disappearing as suddenly as he had arrived.	348	1892	Johan Nagel	Norway	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32586.Mysteries
