The Mayor of Casterbridge		Thomas Hardy, Keith Wilson	3.83	54436	2256	‘ I’ve not always been what I am now ’ In a fit of drunken anger, Michael Henchard sells his wife and baby daughter for five guineas at a country fair. Over the course of the following years, he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the community of Casterbridge, but behind his success there always lurk the shameful secret of his past and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper. Subtitled ‘A Story of a Man of Character’, Hardy’s powerful and sympathetic study of the heroic but deeply flawed Henchard is also an intensely dramatic work, tragically played out against the vivid backdrop of a close-knit Dorsetshire town.	445	1886	Michael Henchard, Donald Farfrae, Elizabeth-Jane Newson, Susan Henchard, Lucetta Templeman, Richard Newson	United Kingdom, Wessex, England, Casterbridge, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56759.The_Mayor_of_Casterbridge
