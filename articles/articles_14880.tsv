The Weird Sisters		Eleanor Brown	3.36	43831	6404	There is no problem that a library card can't solve. The Andreas family is one of readers. Their father, a renowned Shakespeare professor who speaks almost entirely in verse, has named his three daughters after famous Shakespearean women. When the sisters return to their childhood home, ostensibly to care for their ailing mother, but really to lick their wounds and bury their secrets, they are horrified to find the others there. See, we love each other. We just don't happen to like each other very much. But the sisters soon discover that everything they've been running from-one another, their small hometown, and themselves-might offer more than they ever expected.	320	January 1st 2011	Rose, Cordelia, Bianca		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8573020-the-weird-sisters
