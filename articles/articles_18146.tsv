A Deeper Cut		Sheri Wren Haymore	4.00	21	10	When Hunter Kittrell and his beautiful friend, Miki, arrive in Beaufort, NC, for their summer stay, they decide to liven up the small town by pulling a harmless prank. That "harmless prank," however, quickly finds them deeply entangled in a blood bath face-off with a knife-wielding serial killer. As the usually peaceful town is drawn into chaos, Hunter and Miki find themselves pulled more deeply into the investigation, and it turns out their connections to the murders may not be as tenuous as they seemed at first. As the investigation continues, burning questions bubble to the surface: Why is Hunter being framed for the murder? And why are there mentions of his long-lost father popping up all over town? Everything comes crashing down to a startling conclusion on Hunter's 21st birthday, when he's finally forced to confront the truths he's been running from all his life.	344	January 20th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18877657-a-deeper-cut
