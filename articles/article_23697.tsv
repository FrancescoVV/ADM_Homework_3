Compromising Positions	Invested In Love #1	Jenna Bayley-Burke	3.70	2661	272	Falling in love is the last thing on his busy agenda…but compromising positions can lead just about anywhere. David Strong knows how to do a lot of things—run an international fitness company, finesse stock portfolios and stay out of emotional entanglements. That is, until he gets tangled up with Sophie Delfino and her Sensational Sex workout. He’s supposed to help her demonstrate Kama Sutra positions for her couples’ yoga class. The rigorous postures require more than just physical control. And his co-instructor unexpectedly tests his control to the limit. Sophie’s been fantasizing about David since her teens, but she never dreamed she’d actually be expected to run through her intimate desires—with an audience! The class is very professional, tame even—or it would be, if she’d been in any of the positions before. But she hasn’t—except in her wildest fantasies about David. Sophie knows she wants David in every way, and she’s flexible enough to use whatever she has to get him. David can’t afford any unexpected distractions. Besides the sensual positions he has to endure without embarrassing himself in public, there’s an embezzler stealing from his company. And then there’s Sophie—who is well on her way to stealing his well-guarded heart.	248	March 2009	David Strong, Sophie Delfino, Cameron Price, Curtis Frye, Jake Tolliver	Portland, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6391348-compromising-positions
