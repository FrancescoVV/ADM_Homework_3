The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History		Robert M. Edsel, Bret Witter	3.76	46037	3740	At the same time Adolf Hitler was attempting to take over the western world, his armies were methodically seeking and hoarding the finest art treasures in Europe. The Fuehrer had begun cataloguing the art he planned to collect as well as the art he would destroy: "degenerate" works he despised. In a race against time, behind enemy lines, often unarmed, a special force of American and British museum directors, curators, art historians, and others, called the Momuments Men, risked their lives scouring Europe to prevent the destruction of thousands of years of culture. Focusing on the eleven-month period between D-Day and V-E Day, this fascinating account follows six Monuments Men and their impossible mission to save the world's great art from the Nazis.	473	August 20th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6514074-the-monuments-men
