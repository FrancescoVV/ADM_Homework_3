Just Ella	The Palace Chronicles #1	Margaret Peterson Haddix	3.75	33275	1690	Being a princess isn't all that... You've heard the fairy tale: a glass slipper, Prince Charming, happily ever after... Welcome to reality: royal genealogy lessons, needlepoint, acting like "a proper lady," and—worst of all—a prince who is not the least bit interesting, and certainly not charming. As soon-to-be princess Ella deals with her new-found status, she comes to realize she is not "your majesty" material. But breaking off a royal engagement is no easy feat, especially when you're crushing on another boy in the palace... For Ella to escape, it will take intelligence, determination, and spunk—and no ladylike behavior allowed.	240	August 28th 1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162719.Just_Ella
