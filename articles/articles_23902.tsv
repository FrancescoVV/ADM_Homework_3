Tear of the Gods	Rogue Angel #31	Alex Archer, Joseph Nassise	3.87	284	13	It started as a dreama redheaded warrior king fought and died for his men centuries ago. The dream would lead archaeologist Annja Creed to the king's undisturbed corpse and one of England's greatest mythical artifacts. Deep in an archaeological dig in England's Midlands, Annja locates a braided necklace around a mummiï ¬  ed king's neck. Made of an unusual materialnot quite obsidian, but gleaming with multihued colorthe torc is an astonishing ï ¬  nd. But someone knows exactly what the torc means. And he will do anything to get his hands on the Tear of the Gods. When the dig is compromised and innocent archaeologists are slain, even Annja herself is left for dead. Now she is ï ¬ ‚ eeing for her life, not knowing the terrifying truth about the relic she risks everything to protector the devastating consequences should it fall into the wrong hands .	318	July 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10315529-tear-of-the-gods
