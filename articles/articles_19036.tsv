Flutter		Olivia Evans	4.21	497	162	Dylan Walker has spent six years trying to move on from the loss of his girlfriend, Presley Cooper. Motivated by grief and the desire to do for others what he couldn’t do for her, he burns the candle at both ends to make it through medical school. After graduation he moves west, putting as much distance as possible between his past and his present. Or so he thought. Unknowingly, Dylan has been set on a path that will destroy everything he thought he knew. All the pain, all the grief, was all for nothing. With the help of an unexpected ally, Dylan must find the answers and save the girl he loves before it’s too late. Deceit. Betrayal. Revenge. A second chance at love. But first, he must find a way to make her remember her past. Remember him. Remember everything.	448	July 24th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35083833-flutter
