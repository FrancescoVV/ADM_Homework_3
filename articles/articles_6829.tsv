Wildefire	Wildefire #1	Karsten Knight	3.73	8387	896	EVERY FLAME BEGINS WITH A SPARK. Blackwood Academy was supposed to be a fresh start for Ashline Wilde. A secluded boarding school deep in the heart of California's redwood forests, three thousand miles from her old life - it sounded like the new beginning she needed after an act of unspeakable violence left a girl in her hometown dead. But Blackwood is far from the peaceful haven Ashline was searching for. Because terrifying, supernatural beasts roam the forests around campus. Because the murderer from Ashline's hometown - her own sister - has followed her across the country. Because a group of reincarnated gods and goddesses has been mysteriously summoned to Blackwood... ...and Ashline's one of them.	394	July 26th 2011	Ashline Wilde, Eve Wilde, Elizabeth Jacobs, Richard Lesley, Reggie Butler, Christian Marsh, Jackie Cutter, Rich Lesley, Bobby Jones, Darren Puget		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11478365-wildefire
