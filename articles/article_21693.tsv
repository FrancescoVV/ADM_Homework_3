Sentenced to Prism	Humanx Commonwealth #12	Alan Dean Foster	3.96	1584	70	The company had a big problem, it was illegally exploiting a fabulously rich planet maned Prism, a world where even the tiniest creatures were living jewels. But somehow, all contact had been lost with the scientist of the survey team. The Company didn't want to draw attention to itself by sending in a rescue mission so they assigned Evan Orgell, a self-confident problem-solver, to investigate. He was smart, he was good. He was backed up by the Commonwealth' s best equipment. What could possibly go wrong?	273	August 12th 1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35136.Sentenced_to_Prism
