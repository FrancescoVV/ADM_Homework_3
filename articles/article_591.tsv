Interpreter of Maladies		Jhumpa Lahiri	4.15	160595	10749	Navigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling new world, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant, touching stories seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In "A Temporary Matter," published in The New Yorker , a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant.	198	April 20th 1999	Dev, Elliot, Miranda, Shobha, Lilia, Shukumar, Mr. Pirzada, Mr. Das, Mrs. Das, Mr. Kapasi, Boori Maa, Mrs. Dalal, Laxmi, Mrs. Sen, Sanjeev, Twinkle	Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Kolkata (India), Odisha (India), Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies
