MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors	M*A*S*H #1	Richard Hooker	3.97	6214	640	Before the movie, this is the novel that gave life to Hawkeye Pierce, Trapper John, Hot Lips Houlihan, Frank Burns, Radar O'Reilly, and the rest of the gang that made the 4077th MASH like no other place in Korea or on earth. The doctors who worked in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) during the Korean War were well trained but, like most soldiers sent to fight a war, too young for the job. In the words of the author, "a few flipped their lids, but most of them just raised hell, in a variety of ways and degrees." For fans of the movie and the series alike, here is the original version of that perfectly corrupt football game, those martini-laced mornings and sexual escapades, and that unforgettable foray into assisted if incompleted suicide--all as funny and poignant now as they were before they became a part of America's culture and heart.	219	1968	Captain Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce, Captain "Trapper" John Francis Xavier McIntyre, Captain Augustus Bedford "Duke" Forrest, Radar O'Reilly, Brigadier General Hamilton Hartington Hammond, Captain Walter "Painless" Koskuisko Waldowski, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake, Major Jonathan Hobson, Captain Ugly John Black, Father John Patrick "Dago Red" Mulcahy, Shaking Sammy, Corporal Jones, Sergeant Mother Divine, Captain Frank Burns, Private Lorenzo Boone, Major Margaret "Hot-Lips" Houlihan, Ho-Jon, Dr. James Lodge, Benjamin Franklin "Big Benjy" Pierce, Sr., Joe Pierce, Major George Adams, Colonel Ruxton P.
