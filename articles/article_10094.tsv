Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy	Arthurian Saga #1-3	Mary  Stewart	4.39	4545	204	The prophetic voice of Merlin, the mysterious enchanter of Arthurian legend, has completed his story. Written over a period of ten years, Mary Stewart's three best-selling novels now stand together in one volume - the finest work of her distinguished career. Hers is the most extended portrait in all literature in this compelling figure of Dark Age myth and history. Merlin, the protector and tutor of Arthur, has usually been portrayed as an old man. But The Crystal Cave begins the trilogy with the story of his perilous childhood as the bastard son of a Welsh king's daughter and the secret discovery of the magic arts that will set him apart from other men. With the birth of Arthur, Merlin's guardianship began and the ancient legend continues in The Hollow Hills with the dramatic immediacy that is Mary Stewart's special gift.	928	January 1st 1978	Arthur Pendragon, Merlin	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27689.Mary_Stewart_s_Merlin_Trilogy
