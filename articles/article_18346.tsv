Hives in the City: Keeping Honey Bees Alive in an Urban World		Alison Gillespie	4.38	16	5	Hives in the City tells the story of urban beekeepers working in the cities of the Mid-Atlantic region of the US. They keep their bees in surprising locations -- sometimes with surprisingly good results. But just as in other locations, bees in the cities often struggle. This book includes anecdotes about urban beekeeping, urban honey, research on Colony Collapse Disorder, and information for those who want to help the bees. "This book offers an intriguing look at how city beekeepers cope with landscapes, laws, and attitudes that are often antagonistic to the notion of stinging insects. In straightforward prose that sometimes touches on the lyrical, Gillespie provides a fair and unbiased look at the urban side of beekeeping and an especially good portrait of the personalities behind city hives. If you are interested in urban beekeeping or the people who do it, the book offers a comprehensive peek into a very different—and sometimes strange—world." -Rusty Burlew, Director of the Native Bee Conservancy and blogger at www.honeybeesuite.com .	321	March 21st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21857473-hives-in-the-city
