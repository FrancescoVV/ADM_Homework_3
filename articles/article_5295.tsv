Beauty Queens		Libba Bray	3.62	50417	7768	The 50 contestants in the Miss Teen Dream pageant thought this was going to be a fun trip to the beach, where they could parade in their state-appropriate costumes and compete in front of the cameras. But sadly, their airplane had another idea, crashing on a desert island and leaving the survivors stranded with little food, little water, and practically no eyeliner. Whatâ€™s a beauty queen to do? Continue to practice for the talent portion of the program - or wrestle snakes to the ground? Get a perfect tan - or learn to run wild? And what should happen when the sexy pirates show up? Welcome to the heart of non-exfoliated darkness.	396	May 24th 2011	Taylor (Miss Texas), Adina (Miss New Hampshire)	an island in the middle of nowhere	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9464733-beauty-queens
