Big Fish		Daniel Wallace	3.67	18131	1770	He could outrun anybody, and he never missed a day of school. He saved lives, tamed giants. Animals loved him. People loved him. Women loved him (and he loved them back). And he knew more jokes than any man alive. Now, as he lies dying, Edward Bloom can't seem to stop telling jokes -or the tall tales that have made him, in his son's eyes, an extraordinary man. Big Fish is the story of this man's life, told as a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts his son, William, knows. Through these tales -hilarious and wrenching, tender and outrageous- William begins to understand his elusive father's great feats, and his great failings.	192	1998	William Bloom, Edward Bloom, Sandra Kay Templeton, Jenny Hill		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129984.Big_Fish
