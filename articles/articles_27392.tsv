The Infinity Concerto	Songs of Earth and Power #1	Greg Bear	3.89	1066	64	There is a song you dare not sing - a melody that you dare not play, a concerto that you dare not hear: It is called a Song of Power. It is a gateway to another world - a gate that will lock behind you as you pass, barring you from the Earth forever. Resist at all cost. For it is a world of great danger and great beauty - and it is not good to be human in the Realm of the Sidhe.	352	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/340810.The_Infinity_Concerto
