Sa Femme or the Other Woman		Emmanu√®le Bernheim	3.38	242	35	Sa Femme is a classic and elegant tale of adultery. A woman meets a married man and they begin to have a clandestine affair. She becomes obsessed both with the paraphernalia of their affair (collecting her lover's condom wrappers, sugar-cube papers and cocktail sticks) and with his unknown wife, 'sa femme'. A consummate tale of emotional manipulation, observed with the precision of a surgeon and written in luminous prose, Sa Femme makes of its simple story a powerful and clear-headed insight into adultery and the relationships between men and women.	128	1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1833042.Sa_femme
