Point Counter Point		Aldous Huxley	3.86	10611	326	Aldous Huxley's lifelong concern with the dichotomy between passion and reason finds its fullest expression both thematically and formally in his masterpiece Point Counter Point . By presenting a vision of life in which diverse aspects of experience are observed simultaneously, Huxley characterizes the symptoms of "the disease of the modern man" in the manner of a composer--themes and characters are repeated, altered slightly, and played off one another in a tone that is at once critical and sympathetic. First published in 1928, Huxley's satiric view of intellectual life in the '20s is populated with characters based on such celebrities as D.H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murry, as well as Huxley himself.	432	1928	Marjorie Carling, Walter Bidlake, John Bidlake, Hilda Tantamount, Philip Quarles, Edward Tantamount, Lucy Tantamount, Frank Illidge, Everard Webley, Denis Burlap, Elinor Bidlake, Molly d'Exergillod, Mark Rampion, Mary Rampion, Maurice Spandrell, Beatrice Gilray, Sidney Quarles	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5135.Point_Counter_Point
