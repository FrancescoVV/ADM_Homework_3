Harris and Me	Tales to Tickle the Funnybone #2	Gary Paulsen	4.20	4948	778	A young boy spends his tenth summer on his aunt and uncle’s farm, where he is constantly involved in crazy escapades with his cousin Harris. “On the Larson farm, readers will experience hearts as large as farmers’ appetites, humor as broad as the country landscape and adventures as wild as boyhood imaginations. All this adds up to a hearty helping of old-fashioned, rip-roaring entertainment.”-- Publishers Weekly	176	October 29th 1993		Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/570633.Harris_and_Me
