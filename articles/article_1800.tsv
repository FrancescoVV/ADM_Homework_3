The Body Finder	The Body Finder #1	Kimberly Derting	3.94	51060	3987	Violet Ambrose is grappling with two major issues: Jay Heaton and her morbid secret ability. While the sixteen-year-old is confused by her new feelings for her best friend since childhood, she is more disturbed by her "power" to sense dead bodies—or at least those that have been murdered. Since she was a little girl, she has felt the echoes that the dead leave behind in the world... and the imprints that attach to their killers. Violet has never considered her strange talent to be a gift; it mostly just led her to find the dead birds her cat left for her. But now that a serial killer is terrorizing her small town, and the echoes of the local girls he's claimed haunt her daily, she realizes she might be the only person who can stop him. Despite his fierce protectiveness over her, Jay reluctantly agrees to help Violet on her quest to find the murderer—and Violet is unnerved by her hope that Jay's intentions are much more than friendly. But even as she's falling intensely in love, Violet is getting closer and closer to discovering a killer... and becoming his prey herself.	327	March 16th 2010	Violet Ambrose, Jules, Jay Heaton, Claire Amadeus, Chelsea Morrison, Lissie Adams, Maggie Ambrose, Stephen Ambrose, Kathryn Ambrose, Joshua Ambrose, Cassidy Ambrose	Washington (state) (United States), Buckley, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261522-the-body-finder
