Ky has been taken and she will sacrifice everything to find him. And when Cassia discovers Ky has escaped to the wild frontiers beyond the Society there is hope. But on the edge of society nothing is as it seems... A rebellion is rising. And a tangled web of lies and double-crosses could destroy everything.	367	November 1st 2011	Cassia Reyes, Ky Markham, Xander Carrow		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15812814-crossed
