Reflections on the Self		Jiddu Krishnamurti, Raymond Martin	4.27	221	25	Described by the Dalai Lama as "one of the greatest thinkers of the age", Jiddu Krishnamurti has influenced millions throughout the twentieth century -- including such notables as Joseph Campbell, Dr. Jonas Salk, Aldous Huxley, Van Morrison, Bertrand Russell, Henry Miller, and Bruce Lee -- and his work continues to inspire even a decade after his death. Born of middle-class Brahmin parents in 1895, Krishnamurti was recognized at age fourteen by Theosophists Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater as the anticipated world teacher and proclaimed to be the vehicle for the reincarnation of Christ in the West and of Buddha in the East. In 1929 he repudiated these claims and traveled the world, sharing his philosophical insights and establishing schools and foundations.Because Krishnamurti had no interest in presenting theories, his thought is far removed from academic philosophy in the analytic tradition, yet his insights remain extremely relevant to contemporary philosophical theories and to people who are passionately interested in understanding themselves and the world. Rather than a theorist, Krishnamurti was a seer and a teacher. He saw inherently distorting psychological structures that bring about a division in every person's consciousness between "the observer" and "the observed". This division, he believed, is a potent source of conflict -- both internally for the individual and through the individual externalized for society as a whole. Krishnamurti envisioned a radical transformation in human consciousness and offered a way to transcend these harmful structures. Krishnamurti: Reflections on the Self is a collection of Krishnamurti's writings and lectures about the individual inrelation to society. In Reflections, he examines the importance of inquiry, the role of emotions, the relation between experience and the self, the observer/observed distinction, the nature of freedom, and other philosophical ideas. "In my own life Krishnamurti influenced me profoundly and helped me personally break through the confines of my own restrictions to my freedom". -- Deepak Chopra, M.D.	234	December 30th 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355267.Reflections_on_the_Self
