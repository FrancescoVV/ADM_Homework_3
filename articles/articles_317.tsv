Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe	Whistle Stop, AL #1	Fannie Flagg	4.28	266726	6653	It's first the story of two women in the 1980s, of gray-headed Mrs. Threadgoode telling her life story to Evelyn, who is in the sad slump of middle age. The tale she tells is also of two women-of the irrepressibly daredevilish tomboy Idgie and her friend Ruth, who back in the thirties ran a little place in Whistle Stop, Alabama, a Southern kind of Cafe Wobegon offering good barbecue and good coffee and all kinds of love and laughter, even an occasional murder.	416	1987	Ruth, Mrs. Ninny Threadgoode, Evelyn Couch, Idgie	Davenport, Iowa (United States), Troutville, Alabama (United States), Birmingham, Alabama (United States), Whistle Stop, Alabama (United States) Alabama (United States), Whistle Stop, Alabama (United States), Alabama (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9375.Fried_Green_Tomatoes_at_the_Whistle_Stop_Cafe
