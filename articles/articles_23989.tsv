DOCTOR MARI TEACHES ABOUT A HEALTHY FEELING HEART (Psychological Wholeness Series, #2)		Denise Marie Mari	5.00	1	0	The world is filled with adults and children being referred by medical doctors to mental health providers because their symptoms do not have physical causes. Yet, even though the roots of their symptoms are emotional, common psychological “treatments” lack the key ingredients of loving attention to human feeling and remedies for emotional malfunctions. Health professional Denise Marie Mari, Ph.D. creatively explains the nature and workings of a well-formed and balanced emotional life. Making friends with our emotions provides strength for the journey to psychological wholeness. All proceeds from this book go to support clergy/religious programs of the House of Hope International. www.Lulu.com/spotlight/DoctorMari	12	November 20th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23705985-doctor-mari-teaches-about-a-healthy-feeling-heart
