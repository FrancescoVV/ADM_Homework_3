The Star Rover		Jack London, Lorenzo Carcaterra	4.25	5489	447	The Star Rover , in the UK published as The Jacket , is a collection of short stories revolves around the concept of reincarnation. It tells the story of San Quentin death-row inmate Darrell Standing, who escapes the horror of prison life —and long stretches in a straitjacket— by withdrawing into vivid dreams of past lives, including incarnations as a French nobleman and an Englishman in medieval Korea. Based on the life and imprisonment of Jack London’s friend Ed Morrell, this is one of the author’s most complex and original works.	266	1914	Darrell Standing	San Quentin State Prison, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/862311.The_Star_Rover
