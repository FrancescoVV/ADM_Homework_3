The Invention of Morel		Adolfo Bioy Casares, Ruth L.C. Simms, Jorge Luis Borges, Suzanne Jill Levine, Norah Borges de Torre	4.06	16710	1466	Jorge Luis Borges declared The Invention of Morel a masterpiece of plotting, comparable to The Turn of The Screw and Journey to the Center of the Earth . Set on a mysterious island, Bioy’s novella is a story of suspense and exploration, as well as a wonderfully unlikely romance, in which every detail is at once crystal clear and deeply mysterious. Inspired by Bioy Casares’s fascination with the movie star Louise Brooks, The Invention of Morel has gone on to live a secret life of its own. Greatly admired by Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, and Octavio Paz, the novella helped to usher in Latin American fiction’s now famous postwar boom. As the model for Alain Resnais and Alain Robbe-Grillet’s Last Year at Marienbad , it also changed the history of film.	103	1940	Dora, Irene, El fugitivo, Faustine, Morel, Dalmacio Ombrellieri, La mujer vieja, Haynes, Stoever		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94486.The_Invention_of_Morel
