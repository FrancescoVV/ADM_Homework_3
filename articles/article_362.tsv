Beautiful Creatures	Beautiful Creatures #1	Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl	3.76	542010	22016	Lena Duchannes is unlike anyone the small Southern town of Gatlin has ever seen, and she's struggling to conceal her power, and a curse that has haunted her family for generations. But even within the overgrown gardens, murky swamps and crumbling graveyards of the forgotten South, a secret cannot stay hidden forever. Ethan Wate, who has been counting the months until he can escape from Gatlin, is haunted by dreams of a beautiful girl he has never met. When Lena moves into the town's oldest and most infamous plantation, Ethan is inexplicably drawn to her and determined to uncover the connection between them. In a town with no surprises, one secret could change everything.	563	December 1st 2009	Ethan Wate, Lena Duchannes, Wesley "Link" Lincoln, Amma Treadeau, Macon Ravenwood	Gatlin, South Carolina (United States), South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6304335-beautiful-creatures
