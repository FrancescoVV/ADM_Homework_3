Child Witch London	Child Witch #2	Mike Ormsby	4.52	23	7	What happens when a journalist meets an exorcist? Frank Kean found out the hard way, in Child Witch Kinshasa. In Child Witch London, the second part of this two-volume novel, friendship and fear collide in the peaceful setting of suburban UK. Frank returns to England from Congo. His cosy routine spins out of control, family life implodes, and tragedy strikes. Is it bad luck? Or black magic, retribution by sorcery for betraying Dudu, the homeless street kid he befriended in Kinshasa? Child Witch London - just because you want to help, it doesn't mean you can.	426	February 27th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20962083-child-witch-london
