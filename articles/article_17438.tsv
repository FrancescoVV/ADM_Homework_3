Courage of Fear		Barbara Boyer	4.31	49	27	"An inspirational writer must put her teachings to work when her husband leaves, ruining the wonderful life she has built." Angela Hearly-Peterson had it all - a beautiful, adoring husband, a mansion in the Hollywood Hills, even a Pulitzer Prize for her bestselling inspirational memoir... it's all about to come crumbling down. Her Husband Jackson--the beloved 'moon to her sea' - has a secret gambling problem... In debt to Las Vegas casinos, he commits an almost unspeakable act that will send Angela's life into a downward spiral. She flees the West Coast for her family compound on Nantucket, where she plans to end the miserable charade that her life has become. The island remains home to people who still love Angela and remember the little girl she used to be before fame and fortune struck. One man in particular has been waiting for her return... Slowly, the motley group of islanders bands together to coax Angela back from the edge. "Riveting until the end..."
