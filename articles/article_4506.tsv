The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories		Tim Burton	4.13	33467	2195	From breathtaking stop-action animation to bittersweet modern fairy tales, filmmaker Tim Burton has become known for his unique visual brilliance – witty and macabre at once. Now he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic children – misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the sweetness and the tragedy of these dark yet simple beings – hopeful, hapless heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world we have long left behind (mostly anyway).	115	1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519112.The_Melancholy_Death_of_Oyster_Boy_and_Other_Stories
