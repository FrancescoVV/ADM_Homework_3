Christmas in Camelot	Magic Tree House "Merlin Missions" #1	Mary Pope Osborne, Salvatore Murdocca	4.04	8969	328	The Magic Tree House series has become a staple for inspiring kids to read. Christmas in Camelot is a very special Magic Tree House book. Here, author Mary Pope Osborne uses the literary skills for which she's known to create a longer, more in-depth story featuring the characters kids have come to love. The result is magical: a fast-paced but detailed, easy-to-read story. Jack and Annie go on a quest to save Camelot, a quest that will prove to a beleaguered King Arthur that children and imagination really can make a difference.	128	October 23rd 2001		Frog Creek, Pennsylvania (United States), Camelot	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262436.Christmas_in_Camelot
