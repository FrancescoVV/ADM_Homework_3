Girl Online	Girl Online #1	Zoe Sugg, Siobhan Curham	3.71	54042	5919	I had no idea GirlOnline would take off the way it has - I can't believe I now have 5432 followers, thanks so much! - and the thought of opening up to you all about this is terrifying, but here goes... Penny has a secret. Under the alias GirlOnline, she blogs about school dramas, boys, her mad, whirlwind family - and the panic attacks she's suffered from lately. When things go from bad to worse, her family whisks her away to New York, where she meets the gorgeous, guitar-strumming Noah. Suddenly Penny is falling in love - and capturing every moment of it on her blog. But Noah has a secret too. One that threatens to ruin Penny's cover - and her closest friendship - forever.	352	November 25th 2014	Penny Shoelace, Noah Flynn	Brighton, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22510983-girl-online
