The Wild One	The de Montforte Brothers #1	Danelle Harmon	3.93	7320	517	England, 1776: Lord Gareth de Montforte is known as an irresponsible rake with a heart of gold. When he takes a bullet for boldly thwarting a stagecoach robbery, he is stunned to discover that the beautiful young woman he has heroically rescued, Juliet Paige, is his deceased brother’s American fiancée, accompanied by her infant daughter. Despite his brother the duke's refusal to acknowledge Juliet, Gareth is determined to do right by the courageous woman who crossed an ocean to give her baby her rightful name. But Juliet is wary of marrying this black sheep aristocrat, even while she is hopelessly charmed by the dashing devil. Never has she met anyone who embraces life so thoroughly, who makes her laugh, who loves her so well. And, even when it seems the odds are against them, Juliet has absolute faith that Gareth will go beyond the call of duty, risking his life itself to give her and her daughter a home — and a love that will last a lifetime.	373	December 26th 1997	Gareth de Montforte, Juliet Paige, Charles de Montforte, Andrew de Montforte, Lucien de Montforte, Jonathan Snelling, Jon Cokeham, Lavinia Bottomley, Neil Chilcot, Hugh Rochester, Nails Fleming, Lady Brookhampton, Tom Audlett, Woodford, Bull O'Rourke, Jim Lumford, Tom Houghton, Mrs. Fleming, Lady Nerissa	Berkshire, England, London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30814690-the-wild-one
