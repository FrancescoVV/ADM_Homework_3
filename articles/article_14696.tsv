The Darkest Seduction	Lords of the Underworld #9	Gena Showalter	4.33	25622	1259	At long last, New York Times bestselling author Gena Showalter unveils the story of Paris, the darkest and most tormented Lord of the Underworld. Possessed by the demon of Promiscuity, immortal warrior Paris is irresistibly seductive — but his potent allure comes at a terrible price. Every night he must bed someone new, or weaken and die. And the woman he craves above all others is the one woman he'd thought was forever beyond his reach... until now. Newly possessed by the demon of Wrath, Sienna Blackstone is racked by a ruthless need to punish those around her. Yet in Paris's arms, the vulnerable beauty finds soul-searing passion and incredible peace. Until a blood feud between ancient enemies heats up. Will the battle against gods, angels and creatures of the night bind them eternally — or tear them apart?	504	February 28th 2012	Ashlyn Darrow, Maddox / Violence, Sienna Blackstone, Paris / Promiscuity, William (Lords of the Underworld), Legion (Lords of the Underworld), Gilly (Lords of the Underworld)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9995135-the-darkest-seduction
