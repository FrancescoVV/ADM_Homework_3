Touch of Frost	Mythos Academy #1	Jennifer Estep	3.95	29572	2104	My name is Gwen Frost, and I go to Mythos Academy; a school of myths, magic and warrior whiz kids, where even the lowliest geek knows how to chop off somebody's head with a sword and Logan Quinn, the hottest Spartan guy in school, also happens to be the deadliest. But lately, things have been weird, even for Mythos. First, mean girl Jasmine Ashton was murdered in the Library of Antiquities. Then, someone stole the Bowl of Tears, a magical artifact that can be used to bring about the second Chaos War. You know, death, destruction and lots of other bad, bad things. Freaky stuff like this goes on all the time at Mythos, but I'm determined to find out who killed Jasmine and why; especially since I should have been the one who died...	350	August 1st 2011	Gwen Frost, Daphne Cruz, Logan Quinn, Carson Callahan, Oliver Hector	Asheville, North Carolina (United States), North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9439989-touch-of-frost
