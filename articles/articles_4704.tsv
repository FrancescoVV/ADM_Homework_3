The Happy Prince		Oscar Wilde	4.23	26145	910	More than a hundred years ago, Oscar Wilde created this moving story for his children. Now shimmering illustrations, as bejeweled and golden as the Prince himself, give glowing life to the many dimensions of his tale. His story of friendship, love, and a willingness to part with one's own riches may be more important today than ever before. Full color.	32	May 1888			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79121.The_Happy_Prince
