Twelfth Grade Kills	The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod #5	Heather Brewer, Z Brewer	4.34	15722	733	It all comes down to this. Vlad’s running out of time. The Elysian Council has given him weeks to live, and that’s if the Slayer Society doesn’t kill him – along with all the citizens of Bathory – first. Then there’s the issue of Vlad’s father, who may or may not still be alive after all these years, and oh yeah, that tiny little detail in the Pravus prophecy about Vlad enslaving Vampirekind and the human race. So much for college applications. In this epic finale to Heather Brewer’s heart-stopping Chronicles of Vladimir Tod, dark secrets will be revealed, old friends will become enemies, and warm blood will run cold. Just be careful it isn’t yours.	325	September 21st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7818881-twelfth-grade-kills
