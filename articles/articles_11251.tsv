The Financier	Trilogy of Desire #1	Theodore Dreiser	4.28	5333	218	Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780452008250 A master of literary naturalism, Dreiser is known for his great intensity and keen journalistic eye as he examines real-life subjects. This powerful novel explores the dynamics of the financial world during the Civil War and after the stock-market panic caused by the Great Chicago Fire. The first in a ''trilogy of desire,'' The Financier tells the story of the ruthlessly dominating broker Frank Cowperwood as he climbs the ladder of success, his adoring mistress championing his every move. Based on the life of financier C. T. Yerkes, Dreiser's cutting portrayal of the corrupt magnate Cowperwood illustrates the idea that wealth is often obtained by less than reputable means.	460	1912	Frank Cowperwood	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/381364.The_Financier
