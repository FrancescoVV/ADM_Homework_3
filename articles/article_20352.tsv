Love and Other Subjects		Kathleen Shoop	3.65	223	76	For every woman who thought she chose the wrong career… In Love and Other Subjects Carolyn Jenkins strives for two things—to be the greatest teacher ever and to find true love. She’s as skilled at both as an infant chowing down with a fork. Carolyn’s suburban upbringing and genuine compassion for people who don’t fit effortlessly into society are no match for weapon-wielding, struggling students, drug-using colleagues, and a wicked principal. Meanwhile, her budding relationship with a mystery man is thwarted by his gaggle of eccentric sisters. Carolyn depends on her friends to get her through the hard times, but with poverty-stricken children at her feet and a wealthy man at her side, she must define who she is. The reality of life after college can be daunting—the road to full-fledged adulthood is long and unscripted. Can Carolyn take control and craft the life she’s always wanted?	256	December 11th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16849951-love-and-other-subjects
