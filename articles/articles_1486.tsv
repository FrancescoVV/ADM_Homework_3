The Bridge on the Drina	Bosnian Trilogy #1	Ivo Andrić, Lovett F. Edwards, William H. McNeill	4.33	14747	1083	A vivid depiction of the suffering history has imposed upon the people of Bosnia from the late sixteenth century to the beginning of World War I, The Bridge on the Drina earned Ivo Andric the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961. A great stone bridge built three centuries ago in the heart of the Balkans by a Grand Vezir of the Ottoman Empire dominates the setting of Andric's stunning novel. Spanning generations, nationalities, and creeds, the bridge stands witness to the countless lives played out upon it: Radisav, the workman, who tries to hinder its construction and is impaled on its highest point; to the lovely Fata, who throws herself from its parapet to escape a loveless marriage; to Milan, the gambler, who risks everything in one last game on the bridge with the devil his opponent; to Fedun, the young soldier, who pays for a moment of spring forgetfulness with his life. War finally destroys the span, and with it the last descendant of that family to which the Grand Vezir confided the care of his pious bequest - the bridge.	314	1945	Franz Ferdinand, Karađorđe Petrović, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, Abidaga, Fata Avdagina, Radisav, Alihodja Mutevelić, Osman Effendi Karamanli, the man from Plvelje, Pop Nikola, Mula Ibrahim, Arif Beg, Shemsibeg Branković, Milan Glasinčanin, Lotte Apfelmaier, Gregor Fedun, Janko Stiković, Fehim Bhatijarević, Nikola Glasičanin, Zorka	Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia, Ottoman Empire	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3140.The_Bridge_on_the_Drina
