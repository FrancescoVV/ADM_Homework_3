Skinhead... The Life I Chose: Memoirs of a Real Skin		Spike Pitt	4.01	81	8	This is a true account of the skinhead cult, told by a man who was really there and still is. It is NOT about Nazism, or Neo-Nazism, and definitely not about politics; it is the story of how the ebullience of youth can be corrupted and misinterpreted by propaganda and the media. Warning This story contains a lot of strong language, British slang and outspoken opinions that may be offensive to some; it is nevertheless the truth.	193	December 18th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23955580-skinhead-the-life-i-chose
