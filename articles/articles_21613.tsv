In The Faery Reel , acclaimed anthologists Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling have asked some of today's finest writers of fantastic fiction for short stories and poems that draw on the great wealth of world faery lore and classic faery literature. These authors, including Neil Gaiman ( American Gods; Coraline ), Gregory Maguire ( Mirror Mirror ), Patricia A. McKillip ( Ombria in Shadow ), Charles de Lint ( The Blue Girl ), Holly Black ( The Spiderwick Chronicles ), and Kelly Link ( Stranger Things Happen ), have contributed stories and poems that are varied, unexpected, and wonderfully absorbing reading. Charles Vess's lovely decorations bring each piece to life; as an added bonus, Terri Windling provides a fascinating, thoughtful essay on the history of faery literature. This companion to the World Fantasy Award-winner and Locus best-seller The Green Man is edgy, provocative, and thoroughly magical. Like the faeries themselves.	528	August 3rd 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81042.The_Faery_Reel
