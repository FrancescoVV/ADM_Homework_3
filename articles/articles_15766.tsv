Key of Valor	Key Trilogy #3	Nora Roberts	4.12	33484	813	What happens when the very gods depend on mortals for help? That's what three very different young women find out when they are invited to Warrior's Peak. Light and Knowledge have succeeded in their quest, and two of the keys have been found. The final, and last, test goes to Zoe McCourt—Valor. Zoe has the courage to raise her young son alone, and to face all the adversity life has thrown at them. But will she have the courage to face a foe determined to do anything to stop the third key from being found—even destroying everything and everyone she loves? An unabridged recording (10 hours, 31 minutes).	352	December 30th 2003	Malory Price, Michael Flynn Hennessy, Dana Steele, Jordan Hawke, Zoe McCourt, Bradley "Brad" Charles Vane IV	Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114206.Key_of_Valor
