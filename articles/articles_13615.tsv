Duncan's Bride	Patterson-Cannon Family #1	Linda Howard, Lesa Lockford	3.97	7427	407	Reese wanted a wife. Someone to have children with, someone to help rebuild his ranch, someone uncomplicated, and very different from his first wife, the woman who'd destroyed his life. Now he had Madelyn--sophisticated, citified, willing to herd cattle, keep house and start a family. The only thing she asked for in return was love--one thing Reese couldn't guarantee.	251	August 1st 1990	Reese Duncan, Madelyn Patterson	Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420736.Duncan_s_Bride
