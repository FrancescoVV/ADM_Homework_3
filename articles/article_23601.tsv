Ring for Jeeves	Jeeves #10	P.G. Wodehouse	4.01	3855	322	Ring for Jeeves features one of Wodehouse's best-known characters, Jeeves. It is the only Jeeves novel in which his employer, Bertie Wooster, does not appear (though he is mentioned). Wodehouse adapted the story from a play, Come On, Jeeves, that he had written with his lifelong friend and collaborator Guy Bolton. The story opens with Jeeves's employer, Bertie Wooster, having enrolled in a school that teaches the idle rich how to fend for themselves. In his absence he has allowed Jeeves to offer his services to William "Bill" Rowcester, the impoverished 9th Earl of Rowcester, whose stately home, Rowcester Abbey, is an encumbrance for which the Earl is seeking a buyer. Jeeves becomes embroiled in a complicated affair involving 'fake' bookies, stolen gems, a wealthy American widow and a big game hunter, but, as in all Jeeves novels, the imperturbable valet succeeds in resolving matters to the satisfaction of all parties.	208	April 22nd 1953	Reginald Jeeves, Cuthbert Gervase Brabazon-Biggar, Bill Rowcester, Jill Wyvern, William Egerton Bamfylde Ossingham Belfry, Rosalinda Banks Bessemer Spottsworth, Monica Belfry Carmoyle, Roderick Carmoyle, Ellen Tallulah French, Aubrey Wyvern, Bulstrode, Evangeline Trelawny, Mary Jane Piggott, Clifton Bessemer, Augustus Frobisher, Subadar, Beau Sycamore, Percy Wellbeloved, Oscar Wopple	Southmoltonshire (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18029.Ring_for_Jeeves
