The Broken Wings		Kahlil Gibran, جبران خليل جبران, Anthony Rizcallah Ferris	3.93	16972	2070	This is the exquisitely tender story of love that beats desperately against the taboos of Oriental tradition. With great sensitivity, Gibran describes his passion as a youth for Selma Karamy, the girl of Beirut who first unfolded to him the secrets of love. But it is a love that is doomed by a social convention which forces Selma into marriage with another man. Portraying the happiness and infinite sorrow of his relationship with Selma, Gibran at the same time probes the spiritual meaning of human existence with profound compassion. **Lightning Print On Demand Title	132	1912		Beirut (Lebanon)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/291.The_Broken_Wings
