Infinite Days	Vampire Queen #1	Rebecca Maizel	3.91	9254	1176	“Throughout all my histories, I found no one I loved more than you... no one.” Those were some of Rhode’s last words to me. The last time he would pronounce his love. The last time I would see his face. It was the first time in 592 years I could take a breath. Lay in the sun. Taste. Rhode sacrificed himself so I, Lenah Beaudonte, could be human again. So I could stop the blood lust. I never expected to fall in love with someone else that wasn’t Rhode. But Justin was... daring. Exciting. More beautiful than I could dream. I never expected to be sixteen again... then again, I never expected my past to come back and haunt me...	308	August 3rd 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7744064-infinite-days
