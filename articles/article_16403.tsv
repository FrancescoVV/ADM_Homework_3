Tartuffe		Molière, Martin Sorrell	3.67	30454	795	Condemned and banned for five years in Molière’s day, Tartuffe is a satire on religious hypocrisy. Tartuffe worms his way into Orgon’s household, blinding the master of the house with his religious "devotion," and almost succeeds in his attempts to seduce his wife and disinherit his children before the final unmasking.	180	1664	Tartuffe		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52823.Tartuffe
