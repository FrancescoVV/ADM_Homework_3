The Witch's Boy		Michael Gruber	3.73	1370	211	This critically acclaimed tale of a witch and her goblin-child is wholly original, and the legendary characters of old who touch their story -- Cinderella, Rapunzel, Rumplestiltskin -- are made new through Michael Gruber's imaginative lens. Gruber's literary voice is as magical as his imagination. With The Witch's Boy he has created a wondrous journey through the realms of magic.	377	March 29th 2005	Lump, Ysul, Falance		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123578.The_Witch_s_Boy
