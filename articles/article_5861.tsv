Martin Swans Diary: Black Water Crossing		Kyle Keyes	4.43	2871	16	Martin Swan was not a terrorist, nor a truck driver. He only replied to the want-ad because the wording linked Florida with Washington DC and wanted someone who could speak Arabic. The year was 2008. Jobs were scarce, gas prices high. The back page ad called for a big rig driver with a clean record, who could be at Black Water Crossing the day before Halloween. As fate would have it, a quirky satellite blackout occurred before the government agent could complete the overseas agreement. A follow-up call led nowhere. Thus, the mid-east connection never fell victim to a federal communications dragnet â€“ nor could Martin Swan detail the pending threat against Washington, or where the explosives would come ashore.	306	January 9th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11424443-martin-swans-diary
