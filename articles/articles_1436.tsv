Silent Spring		Rachel Carson, Linda Lear, Edward O. Wilson	3.98	36182	2255	Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was first published in three serialized excerpts in the New Yorker in June of 1962. The book appeared in September of that year and the outcry that followed its publication forced the banning of DDT and spurred revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water. Carson’s passionate concern for the future of our planet reverberated powerfully throughout the world, and her eloquent book was instrumental in launching the environmental movement. It is without question one of the landmark books of the twentieth century.	378	September 27th 1962			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27333.Silent_Spring
