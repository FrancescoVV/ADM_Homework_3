Hunter	Hunting Her #1	Eden Summers	4.16	1746	321	I wasn't looking for his kind of trouble. It found me anyway. Tall. Dark. Addictive. He unravels me with his kisses. Melts me with his touch. But he has secrets. A hidden agenda, beyond his craving for me. A desire for more than tangled silk sheets and our sweat-slicked skin. I need to run. From him. From the lies. But running from the hunter means I've now become the prey. From bestselling author, Eden Summers, comes a seductively thrilling standalone destined to leave you breathless.	266	February 6th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38752034-hunter
