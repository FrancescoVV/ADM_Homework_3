Five Years - The Meeting		Leonard Belmont	4.43	44	8	Do you remember when you knew you were falling in love? What starts with a lucky encounter during their college years turns out to be a moment that will forever define their futures. That breathless, electric feeling in the air; giddy with the excitement of a new day. We have all experienced it in some way. Through the recollection of friends & family, through tender embraces between mother and child, but the most poignant is that of the writings of a love struck man who has already seen the end. In this contemporary romance, author Leonard Belmont takes us on an unhindered emotional journey into the lives of a young couple from the moment they lay eyes on one another. Beginning with the end of their life together, these unhindered thoughts open us up to what love is like in its earliest moments. “It did not take long to understand what I was living in that moment. Love at first sight. My soul mate”	114	May 17th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23126678-five-years---the-meeting
