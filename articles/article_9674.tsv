Carry On, Jeeves	Jeeves #3	P.G. Wodehouse	4.27	19430	1190	Meet the inimitable gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves... From the moment Jeeves glides into Bertie Wooster's life and provides him with a magical hangover cure, Bertie begins to wonder how he's ever managed without him. Jeeves makes himself totally indispensable in every way, disentangling the hapless Bertie from scrapes with formidable aunts, madcap girls and unbidden guests. His ability to dig assorted fellows out of sundry holes is nothing short of miraculous. In short, the man is a paragon.	273	1925	Reginald Jeeves, Dahlia Travers, Bertram Wilberforce Wooster, Mabel, Roderick Glossop, Richard P.
