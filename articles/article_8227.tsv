The Way the Crow Flies		Ann-Marie MacDonald	4.10	12860	1191	The optimism of the early sixties, infused with the excitement of the space race and the menace of the Cold War, is filtered through the rich imagination of high-spirited, eight-year-old Madeleine, who welcomes her family's posting to a quiet Air Force base near the Canadian border. Secure in the love of her beautiful mother, she is unaware that her father, Jack, is caught up in a web of secrets. When a very local murder intersects with global forces, Jack must decide where his loyalties lie, and Madeleine will be forced to learn a lesson about the ambiguity of human morality -- one she will only begin to understand when she carries her quest for the truth, and the killer, into adulthood twenty years later.	848	2003		Centralia (Canada), Toronto, Ontario (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7199.The_Way_the_Crow_Flies
