The Sparrow	The Sparrow #1	Mary Doria Russell	4.13	64077	7276	In 2019, humanity finally finds proof of extraterrestrial life when a listening post in Puerto Rico picks up exquisite singing from a planet that will come to be known as Rakhat. While United Nations diplomats endlessly debate a possible first contact mission, the Society of Jesus quietly organizes an eight-person scientific expedition of its own. What the Jesuits find is a world so beyond comprehension that it will lead them to question what it means to be "human".	516	1996	Emilio Sandoz, Jimmy Quinn, Vincenzo Giuliani, John Candotti, Johannes Voelker, Edward Behr, Sofia Mendez, Anne Edwards, George Edwards, Alan Pace, Felipe Reyes, D.W.
