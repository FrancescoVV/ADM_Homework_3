Kiss of Frost	Mythos Academy #2	Jennifer Estep	4.03	23048	1232	I’m Gwen Frost, a second-year warrior-in-training at Mythos Acad­emy, and I have no idea how I’m going to sur­vive the rest of the semes­ter. One day, I’m get­ting schooled in sword­play by the guy who broke my heart—the drop-dead gor­geous Logan who slays me every time. Then, an invis­i­ble archer in the Library of Antiq­ui­ties decides to use me for tar­get prac­tice. And now, I find out that some­one at the acad­emy is really a Reaper bad guy who wants me dead. I’m afraid if I don’t learn how to live by the sword—with Logan’s help—I just might die by the sword...	337	November 29th 2011	Gwen Frost, Daphne Cruz, Logan Quinn, Carson Callahan, Oliver Hector	Asheville, North Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10421530-kiss-of-frost
