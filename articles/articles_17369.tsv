The French Mathematician		Tom Petsinis	3.27	143	19	While growing up in revolutionary France, Evariste Galois immersed himself in the study of mathematics, a pursuit that allowed him a welcome glimpse of order at a time when chaos consumed his country. Arrogant, ambitious, and brilliant, Galois dreamed of solving the quintic, a complex equation that had baffled many talented mathematicians before him -- but after his father's mysterious death, he devoted himself to Republican politics with the same fervent energy he had applied to his mathematical studies. Rich in historical detail and bursting with intellectual passion, this captivating novel describes a genius's valiant quest for truth -- in a turbulent and uncertain era that in many ways mirrors the one in which we live today.	426	January 1st 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/405510.The_French_Mathematician
