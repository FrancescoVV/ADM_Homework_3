Shadow Mountain: A Memoir of Wolves, a Woman, and the Wild		Renee Askins	4.18	544	77	After forming an intense bond with Natasha, a wolf cub she raised as part of her undergraduate research, Renee Askins was inspired to found the Wolf Fund. As head of this grassroots organization, she made it her goal to restore wolves to Yellowstone National Park, where they had been eradicated by man over seventy years before. In this intimate account, Askins recounts her courageous fifteen-year campaign, wrangling along the way with Western ranchers and their political allies in Washington, enduring death threats, and surviving the anguish of illegal wolf slayings to ensure that her dream of restoring Yellowstone's ecological balance would one day be realized. Told in powerful, first-person narrative, Shadow Mountain is the awe-inspiring story of her mission and her impassioned meditation on our connection to the wild.	336	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201287.Shadow_Mountain
