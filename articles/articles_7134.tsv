Soulstice	The Devouring #2	Simon Holt	4.15	3023	272	The Vours: Evil, demonic beings that inhabit human bodies on Sorry Night, the darkest hours of the winter solstice. Six month... Since Reggie first discovered the existence of the Vours in a tattered journal. Since she learned to overcome her fear and destroyed a Vour to save Henry. Now as the summer solstice approaches, the Vours still haunt Reggie, but only in her dreams - until one night, when an unexpected visitor turns her nightmares into reality. Terrifying, nail-biting, and grossly intriguing, Solstice , Book 2 in the Devouring series, will haunt you until the very end.	266	August 19th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6303859-soulstice
