The Rise of Ren Crown: Volume 3	Ren Crown  #3	Anne Zoelle	4.58	384	42	Reeling from what the students at Excelsine University are calling "Bloody Tuesday," Ren is determined to regather her magical family. But the events of the attack were not without multiple costs. Magically broken and exposed, Ren is ripe pickings for multiple factions that want to use and chain her, and the Department is the scariest of the pack. With only a limited amount of time to save her friend, and confined with the rest of the student body awaiting their fate, Ren stands a mere hairsbreadth from losing her freedom completely with each and every decision she makes.	370	July 28th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25768593-the-rise-of-ren-crown
