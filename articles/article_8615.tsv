Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within		Natalie Goldberg	4.19	25866	1887	For more than twenty years Natalie Goldberg has been challenging and cheering on writers with her books and workshops. In her groundbreaking first book, she brings together Zen meditation and writing in a new way. Writing practice, as she calls it, is no different from other forms of Zen practice--"it is backed by two thousand years of studying the mind." This edition includes a new preface and an interview with the author.	312	October 12th 1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44905.Writing_Down_the_Bones
