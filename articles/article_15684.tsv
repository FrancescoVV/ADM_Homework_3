The Bell		Iris Murdoch, A.S. Byatt	3.89	6354	540	A lay community of thoroughly mixed-up people is encamped outside Imber Abbey, home of an enclosed order of nuns. A new bell, legendary symbol of religion and magic, is rediscovered. Dora Greenfield, erring wife, returns to her husband. Michael Mead, leader of the community, is confronted by Nick Fawley, with whom he had disastrous homosexual relations, while the wise old Abbess watches and prays and exercises discreet authority. And everyone, or almost everyone, hopes to be saved, whatever that may mean....Iris Murdoch's funny and sad novel has themes of religion, the fight between good and evil, and the terrible accidents of human frailty.	296	1958	Dora Greenfield, Paul Greenfield, Peter Topglass, Toby Gashe, Catherine Fawley, Nick Fawley, James Tayper Pace, Mark Stafford, Margaret Stafford, Patchway, Father Bob Joyce, Sister Ursula, Mother Clare, Noel Spens, Michael Meade	Imber Court, Gloucestershire, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230.The_Bell
