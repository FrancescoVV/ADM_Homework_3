Wings	Wings #1	Aprilynne Pike	3.75	74782	5101	Laurel was mesmerized, staring at the pale things with wide eyes. They were terrifyingly beautifulâ€”too beautiful for words. Laurel turned to the mirror again, her eyes on the hovering petals that floated beside her head. They looked almost like wings.
