Delta of Venus		Anaïs Nin	3.62	18798	1179	In Delta of Venus Anaïs Nin penned a lush, magical world where the characters of her imagination possess the most universal of desires and exceptional of talents. Among these provocative stories, a Hungarian adventurer seduces wealthy women then vanishes with their money; a veiled woman selects strangers from a chic restaurant for private trysts; and a Parisian hatmaker named Mathilde leaves her husband for the opium dens of Peru. Delta of Venus is an extraordinarily rich and exotic collection from the master of erotic writing.	271	1969	Mariecke, Mary, Viviane, Marianne, Jean, Pierre Comte, Ethel, Elena Kyler, Evelyn, Sylvia, Lilith, Louise, Madeleine, Fred, Mary Anne, Antonio, Brown, Fatima, Donald, Madeline, Mathilde, Michel, Yvonne, Mabel, Mollie, Dalvedo, Martinez, Dobo, Millard Nullings, Mafouka, Kay, Leila, Bijou, Maman, Melie, Manuel, Jacque, Gisele, Gustavo, Kazimir, Marcel, Roger, Martha, Linda, Andre, George Kirrin, John --		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11041.Delta_of_Venus
