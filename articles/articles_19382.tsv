Through Love and Sorrow: Poems and Short Stories (Wendy's Writings Book 1)		Virginia Sullinger, Virginia Sullinger King	5.00	1	1	Poems Through Love and Sorrow is part of a collection of poems and short stories that I had written over the last forty years before my children were born, and when they were little and all of them faced serious medical conditions. At one point I was in a bad relationship that caused turmoil in our lives. I prayed and wrote poems about the situations going on around me to help me deal with stress. Through Love and Sorrow is book 1 from Wendy's Writings. I pledge to annually donate ten percent of all proceeds to battered women and children's resources. Thank you for interest and bless you and your family and friends.	60	October 31st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50700748-through-love-and-sorrow
