The Wish	The Devil's Lover #1	Dahlia Lu	3.81	355	29	"An eternity is such a long time to rule alone. Will you join me in Hell?" The Archangel Lucifer, Sovereign of Hell, was awakened ahead of his time by the blood of a teenage girl. To satisfy his curiosity, he revived her from her untimely death and granted her a final wish worth dying for. Kali's life has been one tragedy after another. Orphaned since the day she was born, Kali was brought up by her unfeeling grandmother. She too passed away shortly after Kali turned fourteen. The world was too big of a place for a small soul like her to survive on her own. Kali had no choice, but to rely on her childhood friend, Chevalier, for financial support. The two clung to each other, and together they tried to survive the undercurrent beneath the murky water in the sea of life. But that is only the beginning. Weeks before her sixteenth birthday, Kali will meet a man who will ruthlessly tear the sheer fabric of her life and thrust her into a world far more dangerous than anything she could fathom. A fast-paced novel.	184	July 21st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12148528-the-wish
