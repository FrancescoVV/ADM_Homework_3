Claim Me	Stark Saga #2	J. Kenner	4.21	50401	1814	For Damien, our obsession is a game. For me, it is fiercely, blindingly, real. Damien Stark’s need is palpable—his need for pleasure, his need for control, his need for me. Beautiful and brilliant yet tortured at his core, he is in every way my match. I have agreed to be his alone, and now I want him to be fully mine. I want us to possess each other beyond the sweetest edge of our ecstasy, into the deepest desires of our souls. To let the fire that burns between us consume us both. But there are dark places within Damien that not even our wildest passion can touch. I yearn to know his secrets, yearn for him to surrender to me as I have surrendered to him. But our troubled pasts will either bind us close . . . or shatter us completely. Claim Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.	371	April 23rd 2013	Damien Stark, Nikki Fairchild		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16099159-claim-me
