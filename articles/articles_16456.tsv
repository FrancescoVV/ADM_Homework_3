The Choirboys		Joseph Wambaugh	4.06	4938	182	Partners in the Los Angeles Police Department, they’re haunted by terrifying dark secrets of the nightwatch–shared predawn drink and sex sessions they call choir practice. Each wears his cynicism like a bulletproof jockstrap–each has his horror story, his bad dream, his night shriek. He is afraid of his friends–he is afraid of himself.	368	August 4th 1976	American Law Enforcement	Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21491.The_Choirboys
