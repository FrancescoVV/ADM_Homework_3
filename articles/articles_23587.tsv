You Are Special To, Not Forsaken By, God		Dianne Michelle Rankin Taylor	5.00	1	0	This book was written to encourage every "special parent" who is carrying or has carried the weight of rearing a child or children - seemingly - alone. Whether your challenge relates to your child or children, finances, a relationship or the lack thereof, your career or educational dreams, or all of the above, this book was written for you.

"Impossible" is what many thought - and said. BUT GOD has turned Dianne's mess into a message of hope with evidence of His love and the unlimited possibilities in Him. Dianne graduated (pregnant) with her high school class - with honors - and has since earned four degrees including a Master's in Educational Leadership and a Doctorate in Biblical Studies.
