Everything Is Illuminated		Jonathan Safran Foer	3.89	164901	7885	With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man -- also named Jonathan Safran Foer -- sets out to find the woman who may or may not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war; an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior; and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.	276	April 16th 2002	Alexander Perchov, Jonathan Safran Foer	Ukraine, Trochenbrod (Ukraine), Odessa (Ukraine), Lviv (Ukraine)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256566.Everything_Is_Illuminated
