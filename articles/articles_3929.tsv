Drowning Ruth		Christina Schwarz	3.74	79648	2552	In the winter of 1919, a young mother named Mathilda Neumann drowns beneath the ice of a rural Wisconsin lake. The shock of her death dramatically changes the lives of her daughter, troubled sister, and husband. . . . Told in the voices of several of the main characters and skipping back and forth in time, the narrative gradually and tantalizingly reveals the dark family secrets and the unsettling discoveries that lead to the truth of what actually happened the night of the drowning. . . .	368	2000		Wisconsin (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5171.Drowning_Ruth
