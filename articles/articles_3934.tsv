The Will	Magdalene #1	Kristen Ashley	4.29	27517	2961	Early in her life, Josephine Malone learned the hard way that there was only one person she could love and trust: her grandmother, Lydia Malone. Out of necessity, unconsciously and very successfully, Josephine donned a disguise to keep all others at bay. She led a globetrotting lifestyle on the fringes of the fashion and music elite, but she kept herself distant. While Josephine was trotting the globe, retired boxer Jake Spear was living in the same small town as Lydia. There was nothing disguised about Jake. Including the fact he made a habit of making very bad decisions about who to give his love. But for Josephine and Jake, there was one person who adored them. One person who knew how to lead them to happiness. And one person who was intent on doing it. Even if she had to do it as her final wish on this earth.	595	April 8th 2014	Josephine Malone, Jake Spear, Conner Spear, Amber Spear, Ethan Spear	Magdalene, Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20603820-the-will
