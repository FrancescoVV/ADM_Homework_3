Accidental Love		Gary Soto	3.45	1170	241	It all starts when Marisa picks up the wrong cell phone. When she goes to return it, she feels something she's never felt before, something a bit like . . . love. But Marisa and Rene aren't exactly a match made in heaven. For one thing, Marisa is a chola , and she isn't petite; she's a lot of girl, and she's not ashamed of it. Skinny Rene, however, gangles like a sackful of elbows and wears a calculator on his belt. In other words, he's a geek. So why can't Marisa stay away from him? Award-winning author Gary Soto deftly captures all the angst, expectation, and humor that comes with first love in this swift, lighthearted romance.	192	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222007.Accidental_Love
