The Revolt of the Angels		Anatole France, Wilfrid Jackson	4.03	1330	115	As in Paradise Lost, the angels are in revolt against God. On this occasion, their ringleader is inspired to rebellion after reading some books on philosophy and science. Anatole France's 1914 satire of war, government, and religion offers an ever-resonant protest against violence and tyranny.	282	1914			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2251777.The_Revolt_of_the_Angels
