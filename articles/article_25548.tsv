Sebastian	Ephemera #1	Anne Bishop	3.88	9441	410	A world of shifting lands connected only by bridges, Ephemera has been kept stable by the magic of the Landscapers. In one land where night reigns and demons dwell, the half-incubus Sebastian revels in dark delights. But then in dreams she calls to him: a woman who wants only to be safe and loved-a woman he hungers for while knowing he may destroy her. But a more devastating destiny awaits Sebastian, for in the quiet gardens of the Landscapers' school, evil is stirring. The nearly forgotten Eater of the World has escaped its prison-and Sebastian's realm may be the first to fall.	436	February 7th 2006	Sebastian, Lynnea, Glorianna Belladonna, Lee, Koltak, Eater of the World		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47952.Sebastian
