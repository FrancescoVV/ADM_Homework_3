Steppenwolf		Hermann Hesse, Basil Creighton	4.13	136587	4907	Steppenwolf is a poetical self-portrait of a man who felt himself to be half-human and half-wolf. This Faust-like and magical story is evidence of Hesse's searching philosophy and extraordinary sense of humanity as he tells of the humanization of a middle-aged misanthrope. Yet his novel can also be seen as a plea for rigorous self-examination and an indictment of the intellectual hypocrisy of the period. As Hesse himself remarked, "Of all my books Steppenwolf is the one that was more often and more violently misunderstood than any of the others".	256	1927	Mariecke, Harry Haller, Pablo Soler, Hermine		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf
