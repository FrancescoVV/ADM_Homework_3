In the form of wolf, he meets a young human child who he is instantly drawn to in a fierce way he doesn’t quite understand. Sonia Arlington has lived a lonely life. She has certain abilities that make her strange and she has a rare disease that, if untreated, could kill her. Her father makes her vow that she will never let others discover her abilities.

He’s forced to claim his mate and integrate Sonia into a world that is strange and frightening. As Sonia attempts to adjust, Callum attempts to cope with the knowledge that his mate is mortal.
