A Mermaid's Kiss	Daughters of Arianne #1	Joey W. Hill	3.84	1400	158	The angelic Jonah has been battling the Dark Ones for centuries. But his noble spirit has begun to tire with the weight of war - allowing a Dark One to strike a blow that severs his wings and knocks him into the sea. Anna is a Daughter of Arianne - a direct descendant of the mermaid of legend. Anna's longing for love compels her to risk her very life to protect and hide the fallen Jonah. And the longer Jonah delays his return to the heavens, the more Anna's secret passions are tempted. But as she falls more in love with him, Anna wonders if she's destined to lose her heart and her dreams to save Jonah's soul?	374	October 30th 2008	Micah, Anna (Joey W.
