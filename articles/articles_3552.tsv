Wonderstruck		Brian Selznick	4.16	52622	6739	Ben and Rose secretly wish for better lives. Ben longs for the father he has never known. Rose dreams of a mysterious actress whose life she chronicles in a scrapbook. When Ben discovers a puzzling clue in his mother's room and Rose reads an enticing headline in the newspaper, both children set out alone on desperate quests to find what they are missing. Set fifty years apart, these two independent stories - Ben's told in words, Rose's in pictures - weave back and forth in symmetry.	640	September 13th 2011	Ben Wilson, Rose Kincaid, Walter Kincaid	Hoboken, New Jersey (United States), New York City, New York (United States), Gunflint Lake, Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10128428-wonderstruck
