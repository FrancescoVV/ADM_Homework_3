Reservation Blues		Sherman Alexie	3.98	12636	907	The life of Spokane Indian Thomas Builds-the-Fire irrevocably changes when blues legend Robert Johnson miraculously appears on his reservation and passes the misfit storyteller his enchanted guitar. Inspired by this gift, Thomas forms Coyote Springs, an all-Indian Catholic band who find themselves on a magical tour that leads from reservation bars to Seattle and New York--and deep within their own souls.	306	January 1st 1995		Wellpinit, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6159.Reservation_Blues
