Just Around The Bend: Más o Menos		Renée Paule	4.50	62	26	Apparently, just around the bend is everything we’ve been looking forward to including world peace, winning the lottery and a blissful retirement. Regrettably, the energy and drive most of us need to enjoy them, should they materialise, have been left way behind us. The buzz word is ‘Now’ but somehow we always seem to be either side of it. Perhaps we’re too busy with the rituals of daily life to consider what homilies like ‘Know Thyself’, and ‘Who am I?’ really mean. Maybe we missed something along the way, or prefer to live with the mystery of it all - contenting ourselves with ‘poster’ philosophy. However, if ‘poster’ philosophy leaves you feeling dissatisfied, then this book, which covers a range of mind-stretching topics, might be just what you’re looking for.	168	October 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52661800-just-around-the-bend
