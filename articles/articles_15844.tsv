Understood Betsy		Dorothy Canfield Fisher	4.16	11694	739	For all of her nine years, fragile Elizabeth Ann has heard her Aunt Frances refer in whispers to her "horrid Putney cousins." But when her aunt can no longer care for her, Elizabeth Ann must leave her sheltered life to live in the wilds of Vermont with those distant relatives. In the beginning, Elizabeth Ann is shocked by country living--pets are allowed to sleep in the house and children are expected to do chores! But with country living comes independence and responsibility, and in time, Elizabeth Ann finds herself making friends and enjoying her new family. When the year is up and Aunt Frances comes to get her niece, she finds a healthier, prouder girl with a new name--Betsy--and a new outlook on life. Understood Betsy has delighted generations of young readers since it was first published by Henry Holt and Company in 1917.	176	1916	Elizabeth Ann, Aunt Harriet, Cousin Frances, Abigail Putney, Henry Putney, Ann Putney	Pennsylvania (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347151.Understood_Betsy
