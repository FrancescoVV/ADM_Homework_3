What Ho! The Best of P.G. Wodehouse		P.G. Wodehouse	4.44	1130	73	Published to mark the 25th anniversary of PG Wodehouse's death, this is the first major new selection of his work to be published for a generation. This anthology of stories, novel-extracts, working drafts, articles, letters and poems gives a fresh angle on the twentieth century's greatest humourist. In his introduction, Stephen Fry writes: "What a very, very lucky person you are. Spread out before you are the finest and funniest words from the finest and funniest writer the past century ever knew... Without Wodehouse I am not sure that I would be a tenth of what I am today... He taught me something about good nature. It IS enough to be benign, to be gentle, to be funny, to be kind."	712	February 3rd 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317460.What_Ho_The_Best_of_P_G_Wodehouse
