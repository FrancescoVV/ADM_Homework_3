Talisman Of El	Arcadia Saga #1	Alecia Stone, Al   Stone	3.94	524	202	WHAT IF YOUR WHOLE LIFE WAS A LIE? One Planet. Two Worlds. Population: Human ... 7 billion. Others ... unknown. When 14-year-old Charlie Blake wakes up sweating and gasping for air in the middle of the night, he knows it is happening again. This time he witnesses a brutal murder. He's afraid to tell anyone. No one would believe him ... because it was a dream. Just like the one he had four years ago - the day before his dad died. Charlie doesn't know why this is happening. He would give anything to have an ordinary life. The problem: he doesn't belong in the world he knows as home. He belongs with the others.	398	2012	Candra, Charlie Blake, Alex Dench, Derkein Odessa, Richmond Kerd, Jacob Willoughby	West Sussex, England (United Kingdom), New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54954419-talisman-of-el
