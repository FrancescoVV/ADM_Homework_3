Realmgolds	The Gryphon Clerks #1	Mike Reeves-McMillan	3.97	72	15	A reluctant, inexperienced and ineffectual ruler must become the leader his people need when an old rival's hate-filled rhetoric foments rebellion. The young ruler has an ally and mentor, a competent woman who rules the realm to the south. Unfortunately, an ancient magical treaty between their realms means she canâ€™t send in her troops, her skyboats or her pressure guns. What she can do, though, is share a new magical communications technology and her elite corps of Gryphon Clerks.	272	March 1st 2013	Victory, Master-Mage Amiable, Grace Carter, Determined, Reliable Chandler, Admirable Silverstones		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33991467-realmgolds
