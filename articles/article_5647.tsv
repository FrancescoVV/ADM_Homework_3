The Rape of Nanking		Iris Chang	4.12	26911	2010	In December 1937, the Japanese army invaded the ancient city of Nanking, systematically raping, torturing, and murdering more than 300,000 Chinese civilians. This book tells the story from three perspectives: of the Japanese soldiers who performed it, of the Chinese civilians who endured it, and of a group of Europeans and Americans who refused to abandon the city and were able to create a safety zone that saved many.	290	October 14th 1997		Nanjing (China)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95784.The_Rape_of_Nanking
