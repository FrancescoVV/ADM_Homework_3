From Lukov with Love		Mariana Zapata	4.33	31070	3799	If someone were to ask Jasmine Santos to describe the last few years of her life with a single word, it would definitely be a four-letter one. After seventeen years—and countless broken bones and broken promises—she knows her window to compete in figure skating is coming to a close. But when the offer of a lifetime comes in from an arrogant idiot she’s spent the last decade dreaming about pushing in the way of a moving bus, Jasmine might have to reconsider everything. Including Ivan Lukov.	493	February 1st 2018	Jasmine Santos, Ivan Lukov		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37683751-from-lukov-with-love
