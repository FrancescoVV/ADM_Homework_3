The Butterfly Man		Heather     Rose	4.06	375	46	Winner of the Davitt Award – Crime Fiction Novel of the Year 2006 In November 1974 a young English nanny named Sandra Rivett was murdered in London's West End. Her employer, Lord Lucan, was named as her attacker. It was widely assumed he had mistaken her for his wife. Lord Lucan disappeared the night Sandra Rivett died and has never been seen since. Henry Kennedy lives on a mountain on the other side of the world. He is not who he says he is. Is he a murderer or a man who can never clear his name? And is he the only one with something to hide? Set in Tasmania, Africa and London's Belgravia, The Butterfly Man is an absorbing novel about transformation and deception, and the lengths to which we will go to protect the ones we love.	317	January 1st 2005	Lili, Lord Lucan, Henry Kennedy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1585765.The_Butterfly_Man
