Crave	Crave #1	Laura J. Burns, Melinda Metz	3.88	3518	329	Shay could never do the things her friends could--never try out for sports, never go to parties, never fall in love. Because of the mysterious and incurable blood disorder she was born with, she can barely make it through three days of school a week. But now, her doctor-turned-stepfather has a brand-new treatment that he thinks will change everything. And it does. As soon as the new blood starts pumping into Shay's veins, she has visions of a different life...Gabriel's life. She sees an orphanage, loss, fangs, blood, and lust that she can't explain. Is Gabriel real? And if he is, could he really be what she thinks he is?	278	March 1st 2003	Shay		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7242757-crave
