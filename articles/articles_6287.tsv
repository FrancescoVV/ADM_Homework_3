Coming Up for Air		George Orwell	3.79	12222	836	George Bowling, the hero of Orwell's comic novel, is a middle-aged insurance salesman who lives in an average English suburban row house with a wife and two children. One day, after winning some money from a bet, he goes back to the village where he grew up, to fish for carp in a pool he remembers from thirty years before. The pool, alas, is gone, the village has changed beyond recognition, and the principal event of his holiday is an accidental bombing by the RAF.	278	June 12th 1939	George Bowling, Hilda Bowling, Joe Bowling, Porteus, Elsie Waters, George Bowling, Hilda Bowling, Joe Bowling, Porteus, Elsie Waters	London, England (United Kingdom), Charing Cross, London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509080.Coming_Up_for_Air
