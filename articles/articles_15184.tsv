Love Only Once	Malory-Anderson Families #1	Johanna Lindsey	4.06	17511	719	The exquisite niece of Lord Edward and Lady Charlotte Malory, Regina Ashton is outraged over her abduction by the arrogant, devilishly handsome Nicholas Eden - and is determined to make the rogue pay with his heart. A golden-haired seducer, Nicholas has been hardened by a painful secret in his past. And now that he has besmirched Reggie's good name, the hot-tempered lady has vowed to wed him. Her fiery beauty stirs Nicholas as no woman ever has - and the rake arouses Reggie's passion to an unendurable level. Such uncontrolled desires can lead only to dangerous misunderstandings and, perhaps, to a love that can live only once in a lifetime.	344	1985	Regina Ashton, Nicholas Eden, Viscount of Montieth	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/891813.Love_Only_Once
