Louder Than a Whisper: Clearer Than a Bell		Renée Paule	4.71	35	16	This book challenges the status quo of humanity by inviting us to look at the morass of confusion, despair and uncertainty that pervade our society. Through this series of heartfelt essays Renée examines topics such as ‘Pride’, ‘Desire’, ‘Responsibility’, ‘Betrayal’ and ‘Loneliness’ - what are they and how do they affect our lives? These topics - and many more - delve into the human psyche to places many are reticent to visit, but need to if we are ever to change our world. This ‘journey’ begins with us, and only through this journey can we discover our true nature. Fear creates the roadblock that prevents us from taking that first bold step to changing our world - fear of the unknown. Our challenge is to overcome that fear, and the inertia that prevents us from getting started.	174	September 21st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52661901-louder-than-a-whisper
