Darkfall	The Legendsong #1	Isobelle Carmody	4.21	2086	57	Book one of The Legendsong is set in a mysterious, uncertain world that only Carmody could create. After the death of her parents and her beloved instructor, Wind, Glynn devotes herself to the care of her sick twin sister, feeling her own life to be unimportant. One night, during a midnight swim, she is swept across the Void to the troubled watery world of Keltor, through a portal created to summon the mythical Unraveller. What is the mysterious connection between Glynn's world and Keltor? And why does the man who rescued her from the waves bear an eerie resemblance to Wind? While it stands on its own as an absorbing, seductive and powerful novel, the sequels to Darkfall will be eagerly awaited.	616	July 1st 1997	Ember Flanders, Glynn Flanders, Solen, Alene, Bleyd, Tarsin, Coralyn	Keltor	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198581.Darkfall
