Every Heart a Doorway	Wayward Children #1	Seanan McGuire	3.81	69908	12982	Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children No Solicitations No Visitors No Quests Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else. But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children. Nancy tumbled once, but now she’s back. The things she’s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West’s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world. But Nancy’s arrival marks a change at the Home. There’s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it’s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter. No matter the cost.	173	April 5th 2016	Nancy, Jack, Jill, Loreli, Kade, Lundy, Eleanor West		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25526296-every-heart-a-doorway
