Fear is the Key		Alistair MacLean	3.93	3999	116	A classic novel of ruthless revenge set in the steel jungle of an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico – and on the sea bed below it. Now reissued in a new cover style. A sunken DC-3 lying on the Caribbean floor. Its cargo: ten million, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in gold ingots, emeralds and uncut diamonds guarded by the remains of two men, one woman and a very small boy. The fortune was there for the taking, and ready to grab it were a blue-blooded oilman with his own offshore rig, a gangster so cold and independent that even the Mafia couldn’t do business with him and a psychopathic hired assassin. Against them stood one man, and those were his people, those skeletons in their watery coffin. His name was Talbot, and he would bury his dead – but only after he had avenged their murders.	372	1961	John Montagu Talbot, Mary Blair Ruthven, General Blair Ruthven, Herman Jablonsky, Captain John Zaimis, Simon Kennedy, Bryson Vyland, Royale, Larry Fletcher, Al Gunther, Andrew, Sheriff Bill Hickock, Policeman Conelly, Cibatti, Judge Mollison	Florida (United States), Gulf of Mexico (United States), Marble Springs (fiktive), Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149612.Fear_is_the_Key
