Terror and Liberalism		Paul Berman	3.86	549	49	One of our most brilliant public intellectuals, Paul Berman has spent his career writing on revolutionary movements and their totalitarian aspects. Here he argues that, in the terror war, we are not facing a battle of the West against Islama clash of civilizations. We are facing, instead, the same battle that tore apart Europe during most of the twentieth century, only in a new version. It is the clash of liberalism and its enemiesthe battle between freedom and totalitarianism that arose in Europe many years ago and spread to the Muslim world. The author considers the wars against fascism and communism from the past, and draws cautionary lessons. But he also draws from those past experiences a liberal program for the presenta program that departs in fundamental respects from the policies of the Bush administration. "A fluid and lucid essay by one of America's best exponents of recent intellectual history." The Economist	240	April 1st 2003	Noam Chomsky		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156873.Terror_and_Liberalism
