The Dancers at the End of Time (Eternal Champion, #10)		Michael Moorcock	3.89	142	6	The Dancers at the End of Time is a series of science fiction novels and short stories written by Michael Moorcock, the setting of which is the End of Time, an era "where entropy is king and the universe has begun collapsing upon itself". The inhabitants of this era are immortal decadents, creating flights of fancy using power rings which draw on energy devised and stored by their ancestors millions of years prior. Time travel is possible, and throughout the series various points in time are visited and revisited. space travelers are also common, but most residents of the End of Time find leaving the planet distasteful and clich√©d. The title of the series is itself taken from a poem by a fictitious 19th Century poet, Ernest Wheldrake, which Mrs. Amelia Underwood quotes in The End of All Songs.	530	June 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1442263.The_Dancers_at_the_End_of_Time
