The Gunslinger	The Dark Tower #1	Stephen King	3.95	517567	19099	In the first book of this brilliant series, Stephen King introduces readers to one of his most enigmatic heroes, Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In his desolate world, which frighteningly mirrors our own, Roland pursues The Man in Black, encounters an alluring woman named Alice, and begins a friendship with the Kid from Earth called Jake. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, The Gunslinger leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter.	231	June 1st 1982	Jake Chambers, Roland Deschain		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger
