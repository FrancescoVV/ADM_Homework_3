Once Upon a Frog	Whatever After #8	Sarah Mlynowski	4.25	1436	84	Ribbit ribbit! Siblings Abby and Jonah are in for a surprise when the magic mirror in their basement pulls them into the classic story of The Frog Prince. Abby knows how the tale goes: the princess kisses the frog, and he transforms into a handsome prince. Right? WRONG. Turns out the princess is spoiled and mean, and wants nothing to do with the kindly little frog. It's up to Abby and Jonah to help their new friend, the frog, while also making sure the story doesn't spin out of control. But things are never easy when you're fracturing fairy tales!	181	December 22nd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25726634-once-upon-a-frog
