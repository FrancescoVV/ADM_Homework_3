Bang	Black Lotus #1	E.K. Blair	4.20	10308	1767	They say when you take revenge against another you lose a part of your innocence. But I’m not innocent. I haven’t been for a very long time. My innocence was stolen from me. Taken was the life I was supposed to have. The soul I was born with. The ruby heart embedded in a life full of hopes and dreams. Gone. Vanished. I never even had a choice. I mourn that life. Mourn the what-ifs. Until now. I’m ready to take back what was always meant to be mine. But every plan has a fatal flaw. Sometimes it’s the heart. **Due to the dark and explicit nature of this book, it is recommended for mature audiences only as some scenes may be particularly disturbing.**	418	May 9th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21459365-bang
