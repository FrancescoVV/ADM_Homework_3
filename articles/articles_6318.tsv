Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay	L'amica geniale #3	Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein, Helin√§ Kangas, Erja Manto	4.31	89219	5453	In this third Neapolitan novel, Elena and Lila, the two girls whom readers first met in My Brilliant Friend, have become women. Lila married at sixteen and has a young son; she has left her abusive husband and now works as a common laborer. Elena has left the neighborhood, earned her college degree, and published a successful novel, all of which have opened the doors to a world of learned interlocutors and richly furnished salons. Both women have pushed against the walls of a prison that would have seen them living a life of misery, ignorance, and submission. They are afloat on the great sea of opportunities that opened up during the nineteen-seventies. Yet they are still very much bound to each other by a strong, unbreakable bond.	418	October 30th 2013	Raffaella Cerullo (Lila), Elena Greco (Lenuccia), Stefano Carracci, Pasquale Peluso, Carmela Peluso, Ada Cappuccio, Antonio Cappuccio, Nino Sarratore, Enzo Scanno, Marcello Solara, Michele Solara, Pietro Airota, Gigliola Spagnuolo, Alfonso Carracci, Pinuccia Carracci, Rino Cerullo	Naples (Italy), Campania (Italy), Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23156040-those-who-leave-and-those-who-stay
