Present Perfect	Perfect #1	Alison G. Bailey	4.03	14309	2108	He was my first friend, my best friend, and my first love. Noah Stewart was my everything. Standing tall with his dark handsome features, he was as beautiful on the inside as he was on the outside. Noah was perfect in every sense of the word. He wanted us to be together, and we should have been together. Except I wasn’t good enough. I knew if I dared to cross that line with him, I’d do something to screw things up and lose him forever. I couldn’t take that chance. I wouldn’t take that chance. A life without Noah was not a life I wanted to live. So, I kept my feelings in check and didn’t allow them to ruin us. But sometimes life slaps you in the face, forcing you to pay attention, and stop wasting what time you have left. The only thing in life that’s perfect is the present, because it’s our only guarantee.	422	August 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22887477-present-perfect
