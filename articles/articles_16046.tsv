To Command and Collar	Masters of the Shadowlands #6	Cherise Sinclair	4.40	13111	646	Determined to find the human traffickers preying on Shadowlands’ submissives, Master Raoul gets himself invited to a small slave auction. Once informed, the FBI orders him to reject the limited choices so the slavers will invite him to the big auction. To Raoul’s shock, one of the slaves is the kidnapped friend of a Shadowlands sub. She has a scarred body…and an unbroken spirit. He can’t leave her behind. Ruining the FBI’s carefully laid plans, he buys her. Kimberly’s freedom has come at a devastating price: the other women are still slaves. An FBI raid is their only hope for rescue. Desperate to help the Feds locate the big auction, she agrees to pose as Master Raoul’s slave. Wearing a collar again is terrifying, but under the powerful dominant’s care, Kim starts to heal and then to blossom. This is what she’s been drawn to—and fled from—her entire life. She escaped the slavers who captured her body—can she escape the master who’s captured her heart?	341	November 28th 2011		Florida (United States), Savannah, Georgia (United States), Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28525728-to-command-and-collar
