It's Not About Him	Second Glances #2	Michelle Sutton	4.42	48	21	After passing out at Jeff's party, Susie becomes pregnant. Because she has no idea who the father is, she considers having an abortion, but decides to place her baby for adoption instead. Everyone seems to have a strong opinion about what she should do, but it's her decision to make, and hers alone. Following through ends up being more heart-wrenching than she'd imagined, but she's determined to do the right thing for her baby. She's not ready to be a mother. Jeff feels guilty about what happened at his party, and he offers to marry Susie so she won't have to give up her baby like his birth mother had done with him. But Susie refuses, insisting he should marry someone he loves and not marry to rescue her from her painful situation. After Susie places her baby with a couple she trusts, she expects to be abandoned, but Jeff sticks with her despite her attempts to discourage him. They grow close as Jeff tries to comfort Susie while she grieves the separation. Will Jeff see the good in Susie's decision and see that what she did is not about him, but what is best for her child?	321	September 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6555412-it-s-not-about-him
