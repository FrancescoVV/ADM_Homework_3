Soon it becomes clear that Daine's talent, as much as she struggles to hide it, is downright magical. Horses and other animals not only obey, but listen to her words. Daine, though, will have to learn to trust humans before she can come to terms with her powers, her past, and herself.	362	December 1st 1992	Veralidaine Sarrasri, Numair Salmal√≠n, Alanna of Trebond, George Cooper, Jonathan of Conte, Onua Chamtong	Tortall	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13836.Wild_Magic
