Mortal Coils	Mortal Coils #1	Eric S. Nylund	4.06	1921	160	"Nothing interesting had ever happened" to orphans Eliot and Fiona for 15 years with strict Grandmother and well-meaning great gran Cee. But unintended offspring of a goddess and Lucifer can break a long truce. Rather than kill the pair, Immortals create three Trials; Infernals add three Temptations. The pair must stick together; adult allegiances are uncertain.	608	February 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5178537-mortal-coils
