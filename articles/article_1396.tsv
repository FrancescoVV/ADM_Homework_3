Martin Eden		Jack London, Andrew Sinclair	4.44	25843	1464	Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780140187724 The semiautobiographical Martin Eden is the most vital and original character Jack London ever created. Set in San Francisco, this is the story of Martin Eden, an impoverished seaman who pursues, obsessively and aggressively, dreams of education and literary fame. London, dissatisfied with the rewards of his own success, intended Martin Eden as an attack on individualism and a criticism of ambition; however, much of its status as a classic has been conferred by admirers of its ambitious protagonist. Andrew Sinclair's wide-ranging introduction discusses the conflict between London's support of socialism and his powerful self-will. Sinclair also explores the parallels and divergences between the life of Martin Eden and that of his creator, focusing on London's mental depressions and how they affected his depiction of Eden.	480	September 1909	Martin Eden, Ruth Morse, Lizzie Connolly, Joe Dawson, Russ Brissenden	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/929782.Martin_Eden
