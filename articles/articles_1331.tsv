Bone Crossed	Mercy Thompson #4	Patricia Briggs	4.34	96732	3043	By day, Mercy is a car mechanic in the sprawling Tri-Cities of Eastern Washington. By night, she explores her preternatural side. As a shapeshifter with some unique talents, Mercy has often found herself having to maintain a tenuous harmony between the human and the not so human. This time she may get more than she bargained for. Marsilia, the local Vampire Queen, has learned that Mercy crossed her by slaying a member of her clanâ€”and she's out for blood. But since Mercy is protected from direct reprisal by the werewolf pack (and her close relationship with its sexy Alpha), it won't be Mercy's blood Marsilia is after. It'll be her friends'.	300	February 3rd 2009	Adam Hauptman, Samuel Cornick, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Wulfe, Kyle Brooks, Stefan Uccello, Marsilia, Elizaveta Arkadyevna Vyshnevetskaya, Uncle Mike, Tony Montenegro, Margi Thompson, Ben Shaw	United States of America, Washington (state) (United States), Tri-Cities, Washington (United States), Spokane, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3128411-bone-crossed
