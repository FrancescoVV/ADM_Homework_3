What Happened to Lani Garver		Carol Plum-Ucci	4.03	3456	258	The close-knit residents of Hackett Island have never seen anyone quite like Lani Garver. Everything about this new kid is a mystery: Where does Lani come from? How old is Lani? And most disturbing of all, is Lani a boy or a girl? Claire McKenzie isn't up to tormenting Lani with the rest of the high school elite. Instead, she befriends the intriguing outcast. But within days of Lani's arrival, tragedy strikes and Claire must deal with shattered friendships and personal demons--and the possibility that angels may exist on earth.	336	September 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347639.What_Happened_to_Lani_Garver
