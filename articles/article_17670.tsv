The Hollow Heart	The Heartfelt Series #1	Adrienne Vaughan	3.70	102	26	Marianne Coltrane is a feisty, award-winning journalist who is far from lucky in love. Taking herself off to the wilds of the west of Ireland to recuperate, she literally runs into Ryan O'Gorman, the most conceited, infuriating man in the world. He's an actor who's just landed the biggest role in movie history and he loathes journalists. One thing they do have in common is they both think their chance of true love has passed them by...but fate has other ideas! Sexy, moving and funny, this heart-warming duo and cast of colourful characters will stay with you, long after the last page leaves you smiling.	439	October 29th 2012		Ireland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16301205-the-hollow-heart
