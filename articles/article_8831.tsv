Contempt		Alberto Moravia, Angus Davidson, Tim Parks	3.92	3608	354	Contempt is a brilliant and unsettling work by one of the revolutionary masters of modern European literature. All the qualities for which Alberto Moravia is justly famous ~~ his cool clarity of expression, his exacting attention to psychological complexity and social pretension, his still-striking openness about sex—are evident in this story of a failing marriage. Contempt (which was to inspire Jean-Luc Godard’s no-less-celebrated film) is an unflinching examination of desperation and self-deception in the emotional vacuum of modern consumer society.	251	1954	Ricarrdo Molteni, Emilia Molteni	Rome (Italy), Capri (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67141.Contempt
