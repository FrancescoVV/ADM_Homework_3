The Pigman	The Pigman #1	Paul Zindel	3.59	26009	1436	When sophomores John and Lorraine played a practical joke a few months ago on a stranger named Angelo Pignati, they had no idea what they were starting. Virtually overnight, almost against their will, the two befriended the lonely old man; it wasn't long before they were more comfortable in his house than their own. But now Mr. Pignati is dead. And for John and Lorraine, the only way to find peace is to write down their friend's story - the story of the Pigman.	166	October 29th 1968	John Conlan, Lorraine Jensen, Angelo "Pigman" Pignati	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128092.The_Pigman
