Mademoiselle de Maupin		Théophile Gautier, Helen Constantine, Patricia Duncker	3.93	1025	82	A woman uses her incredible beauty to captivate both d'Albert, a young poet, and disguised as a man, his mistress, Rosette. In this shocking tale of sexual deception, Gautier draws readers into the bedrooms and boudoirs of a French château in a compelling exploration of desire and sexual intrigue, and gives voice to a longing which is larger in scope, namely, the wish for completeness in oneself.	363	1835			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253878.Mademoiselle_de_Maupin
