The Shrinking Man		Richard Matheson	3.80	6830	489	While on holiday, Scott Carey is exposed to a cloud of radioactive spray shortly after he accidentally ingests insecticide. The radioactivity acts as a catalyst for the bug spray, causing his body to shrink at a rate of approximately 1/7 of an inch per day. A few weeks later, Carey can no longer deny the truth: not only is he losing weight, he is also shorter than he was and deduces, to his dismay, that his body will continue to shrink.	201	1956	Scott Carey		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33549.The_Shrinking_Man
