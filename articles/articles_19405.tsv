Don't Cry, Dance: A memoir of war, love and forgiveness		Nina Angelo	5.00	2	0	Don’t Cry, Dance is a memoir spanning four generations - through war, horror and loss, to peace, calm and love - from Auschwitz-Birkenow to Paris, London, Athens and ultimately to Sydney, Australia. Janka was a Polish Jewish girl, and Alberto, a Spanish Greek Jewish man. This tale reveals how love and hearts of kindness came out of the horrors of the concentration camps. In 1949, they came to Australia, bringing two cultures, 13 languages and their toddler Nina, to forge a new beginning. These two people would never have met and fallen in love, if they hadn’t survived the attempted extermination of a race in the death chambers of Europe. They knew and taught their children, that we cannot move on without forgiveness. Nina always knew she came from their legacy of resilience, generosity, hospitality, love and their acceptance of all people. As a storyteller and community artist, it was time for her to add her story to theirs and weave a lasting memory and tale of forgiveness for future generations.
