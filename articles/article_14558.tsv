Libriomancer	Magic Ex Libris #1	Jim C. Hines	3.80	11994	1781	Isaac Vainio is a Libriomancer, a member of the secret organization founded five centuries ago by Johannes Gutenberg. Libriomancers are gifted with the ability to magically reach into books and draw forth objects. When Isaac is attacked by vampires that leaked from the pages of books into our world, he barely manages to escape. To his horror he discovers that vampires have been attacking other magic-users as well, and Gutenberg has been kidnapped. With the help of a motorcycle-riding dryad who packs a pair of oak cudgels, Isaac finds himself hunting the unknown dark power that has been manipulating humans and vampires alike. And his search will uncover dangerous secrets about Libriomancy, Gutenberg, and the history of magic. . . .	308	August 7th 2012	Isaac Vainio, Smudge, Johannes Gutenberg, Lena Greenwood, Deb DeGeorge, Nidhi Shah, Nicola Pallas, Alice Granach	Michigan (United States), Upper Peninsula, Michigan (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12844699-libriomancer
