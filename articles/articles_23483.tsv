Undeadly	The Reaper Diaries #1	Michele Vail	3.64	2814	393	The day I turned 16, my boyfriend-to-be died. I brought him back to life. Then things got a little weird... Molly Bartolucci wants to blend in, date hottie Rick and keep her zombie-raising abilities on the down-low. Then the god Anubis chooses her to become a reaper—and she accidentally undoes the work of another reaper, Rath. Within days, she's shipped off to the Nekyia Academy, an elite boarding school that trains the best necromancers in the world. And her personal reaping tutor? Rath. Life at Nekyia has its plusses. Molly has her own personal ghoul, for one. Rick follows her there out of the blue, for another...except, there's something a little off about him. When students at the academy start to die and Rath disappears, Molly starts to wonder if anything is as it seems. Only one thing is certain—-Molly's got an undeadly knack for finding trouble....	272	November 20th 2012	Demetrius, Rath, Henry, Myra, Molly Inez Bartolucci, Rick Widdenstock, Rebecca “Becks” Fortwith, Gena, Ally Bartolucci, Alfonso Bartolucci, Cynthia Bartolucci, Lelia Briarstock, Nonna Gina, Derek Briarstock, Sandra Briarstock, Medusa Chiles, Macintosh Jacobs, Clarissa Jacobs, Autumn Star Lebowski, Rennie, Daniel Moorehead, Barbie Madison, Trina Molina, Irina Derinski, Mitzy Neuberg		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12394032-undeadly
