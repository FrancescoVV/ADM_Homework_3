Flower Feud	Petal Pushers #2	Catherine R. Daly	4.07	140	9	Four sisters. One family-owned flower shop. Endless opportunities for fun...or disaster! This fresh new series is full of girl--and flower--power. A rival florist has set up shop in town, and the Bloom family's store--Petal Pushers--is in trouble! The new flower shop is all sleek and modern, while Petal Pushers is more classic and homespun. Plus, it's prom season, so that means the race is on to get the best corsages, bouquets, and boutonnieres. It's an all-out flower war! When Del finds out that the son of the rival florist is the cute boy in her class, she's torn. Can she stay true to her family while still being friends with her maybe-crush?	192	March 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9305694-flower-feud
