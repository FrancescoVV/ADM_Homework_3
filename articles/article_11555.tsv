The Collected Ghost Stories of E.F. Benson		E.F. Benson, Richard Dalby	4.18	1326	86	United by a perfect chilling atmosphere and graceful literary style, these ghostly stories range from the horror of vampires, homicidal ghosts and monstrous spectral worms and slugs (appearing in the classic "Negotium Perambulans" and "And No Bird Sings") to the satire of humorous tales that poke fun at charlatan mediums and fake seances ("Spinach" and "Mr Tilly's Seance"). This new edition brings together E.F. Benson's greatest stories, making this the one book that no fan of Benson's or of things spectral can afford to miss.	672	January 1st 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60075.The_Collected_Ghost_Stories_of_E_F_Benson
