Ararat (Ararat, #1)		Lajos Zilahy	4.57	53	2	A family pulled apart as tradition meets the changing values and politics of the 20th century. Count Dukay's castles and thousands of acres aren't enough to stem the tides of Nazism, fascism and communism while his sons and daughters are forced to find their way in the strange new world. Historically accurate, filled with universal truths, written with a European flair, The Dukays documents that critical moment in history when power changes hands.	348	1965			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12530162-ararat
