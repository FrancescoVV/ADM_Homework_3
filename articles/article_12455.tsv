The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories		Susanna Clarke, Charles Vess	3.87	16893	1466	Following the enormous success of 2004 bestseller and critics' favorite "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell", Susanna Clarke delivers a delicious collection of ten stories set in the same fairy-crossed world of 19th-century England. With Clarke's characteristic historical detail and diction, these dark, enchanting tales unfold in a slightly distorted version of our own world, where people are bedeviled by mischievous interventions from the fairies. With appearances from beloved characters from her novel, including Jonathan Strange and Childermass, and an entirely new spin on certain historical figures, including Mary, Queen of Scots, this is a must-have for fans of Susanna Clarke's and an enticing introduction to her work for new readers. Some of these stories have never before been published; others have appeared in the "New York Times" or in highly regarded anthologies."" In this collection, they come together to expand the reach of Clarke's land of enchantment--and anticipate her next novel (Fall 2008).	235	October 31st 2004	Jonathan Strange, Gilbert Norrell, John Uskglass (The Raven King)	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15161.The_Ladies_of_Grace_Adieu_and_Other_Stories
