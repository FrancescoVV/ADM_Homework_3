Warrior's Cross		Madeleine Urban, Abigail Roux	3.96	8055	794	Cameron Jacobs is an open book. He considers himself a common waiter with normal friends, boring hobbies, harmless dogs, and nothing even resembling a secret... except a crush on a tall, dark, devastatingly handsome man who dines alone at his restaurant on Tuesday nights. All it takes is one passionate night with Julian Cross to turn Cameronâ€™s world on its head. Julian's love and devotion are all Cameron could have hoped for and more. But when his ordinary life meets and clashes with Julian's extraordinary lifestyle, Cameron discovers that trust and fear can go hand in hand, and love is just a step away from danger.	316	August 1st 2009	Cameron Jacobs, Julian Cross, Preston	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6782412-warrior-s-cross
