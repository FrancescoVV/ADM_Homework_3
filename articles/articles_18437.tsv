The Zombie Chronicles	The Zombie Chronicles #1	Chrissy Peebles	3.52	1759	166	Three siblings fight to survive in a zombie infested world. When they get caught in a flood during a rainstorm, the group is forced to take refuge. They are thrust into a mystery they can't explain, and when things slowly begin to unravel, they learn they have to play by a new set of rules. IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a warning to those readers who are looking for a more violent read with gruesome descriptions of blood and gore. This is NOT that type of book. There is lots of zombie action, but this particular story is based more on the action, drama, and survival aspects. word count = 61,805	287	July 30th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15832350-the-zombie-chronicles
