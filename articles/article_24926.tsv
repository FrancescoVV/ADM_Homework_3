All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono		David Sheff, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, G. Barry Golson	4.27	720	53	Twenty years ago David Sheff climbed the back steps of the Dakota into the personal thoughts and dreams of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. From the kitchen to the studio and up those fateful Dakota steps, Sheff recorded 20 hours of tape, discussing everything from childhood to the Beatles. Sheff gives a rare and last glimpse of John and Yoko, one that seemed to look beyond the kitchen table to the future of the world with startling premonitions of what was to come.	192	August 13th 1957			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233933.All_We_Are_Saying
