Then We Came to the End		Joshua Ferris	3.46	31877	4789	This wickedly funny, big-hearted novel about life in the office signals the arrival of a gloriously talented new writer. The characters in Then We Came To The End cope with a business downturn in the time-honored way: through gossip, secret romance, elaborate pranks, and increasingly frequent coffee breaks. By day they compete for the best office furniture left behind and try to make sense of the mysterious pro-bono ad campaign that is their only remaining "work."	387	2007		Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97782.Then_We_Came_to_the_End
