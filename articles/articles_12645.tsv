Conversations With the Fat Girl		Liza Palmer	3.68	6602	469	Everyone seems to be getting on with their lives except Maggie. At 26, she's still serving coffee at The Beanery Coffee House, while her friends are getting married, having babies, and having real careers. Even Olivia, Maggie's best friend from childhood, is getting married to the doctor with whom she lives. Maggie's roommate? Her dog Solo (his name says it all). The man in Maggie's life? Well there isn't one, except the guy she has a crush on, Domenic, who works with her at the coffee shop as a bus boy.	319	September 1st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345474.Conversations_With_the_Fat_Girl
