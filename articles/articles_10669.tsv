Tyed		L.J. Shen	3.95	13012	1081	Rock bottom has built way more champions than privilege ever has. Blaire, an underachieving college student with zero prospects and a ton of issues (hey, being the less-successful twin of a gorgeous supermodel would totally do that to you) needs something from Ty. Mixed Martial artist Ty, a soon-to-be Welterweight champion of the Xtreme Warrior League and the hottest guy in the Bay Area, wants something from Blaire. But Ty has a secret. And Blaire can barely even handle his truths. Life is about to throw a few knockout punches at both of them. Can they handle the pain?	222	July 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138412-tyed
