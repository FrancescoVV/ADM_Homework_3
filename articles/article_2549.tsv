The Largesse of the Sea Maiden		Denis Johnson	3.79	7101	879	The Largesse of the Sea Maiden is the long-awaited new story collection from Denis Johnson. It follows the groundbreaking, highly acclaimed Jesus’ Son . Written in the same luminous prose, this collection finds Johnson in new territory, contemplating old age, mortality, the ghosts of the past, and the elusive and unexpected ways the mysteries of the universe assert themselves. Finished shortly before Johnson’s death in May 2017, this collection is the last word from a writer whose work will live on for many years to come.	207	January 16th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35135343-the-largesse-of-the-sea-maiden
