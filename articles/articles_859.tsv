The Murder of Roger Ackroyd	Hercule Poirot #4	Agatha Christie	4.24	155360	10931	Considered to be one of Agatha Christie's most controversial mysteries, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd breaks all the rules of traditional mystery writing. The peaceful English village of King’s Abbot is stunned. First, the attractive widow Ferrars dies from an overdose of veronal. Not twenty-four hours later, Roger Ackroyd—the man she had planned to marry—is murdered. It is a baffling, complex case involving blackmail, suicide, and violent death, a cast that taxes Hercule Poirot’s “little grey cells” before he reaches one of the most startling conclusions of his fabled career.	288	June 1926	Hercule Poirot, Dr James Sheppard, Caroline Sheppard, Roger Ackroyd, Flora Ackroyd, Mrs. Ackroyd, Hector Blunt, Ralph Paton, Geoffrey Raymond (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd), Parker (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd), Elizabeth Russell (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd), Mrs. Ferrars, Charles Kent, Inspector Raglan, Mr. Hammond	King's Abbot, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16328.The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd
