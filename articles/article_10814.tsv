Relatively Famous	Famous  #1	Heather C. Leigh	3.85	2933	208	Sydney Tannen seems to have it all. As the daughter of Hollywood royalty, she grew up with money, looks, and fame. But with that also came stalkers breaking into her bedroom, paparazzi running her dad’s car off the road, and multiple kidnapping attempts. Her seemingly glamorous childhood was far from perfect. At age twelve, her mom quits acting and moves Sydney to New York City, changing her last name to hide her from the craziness and danger. Now twenty-four, Sydney still keeps her identity a secret, not getting close enough to anyone for them to figure out who she is. Yet when she meets the gorgeous Drew Forrester in a chance encounter, she has to decide if it’s time to let someone in or if it’s better to stay alone forever. ***Relatively Famous is book 1 in the Famous Series***	330	January 18th 2014		New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22465510-relatively-famous
