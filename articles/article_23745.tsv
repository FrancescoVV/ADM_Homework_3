A House Like a Lotus	O'Keefe Family #3	Madeleine L'Engle	3.75	4407	227	When sixteen-year-old Polly O'Keefe journeys to Athens, she feels confused and betrayed. The past eight months at home were different from any other time in her life. She met the brilliant, wealthy Maximiliana Horne, who gave her encouragement and made her feel self-confident. Polly idolized Max, until she learned a startling truth that left her wounded and angry. Now on a trip to Greece arranged by Max, Polly finds romance, danger, and unique friendships. But can she find a way to forgive Max and remember her as more than a painful memory?	307	November 1st 1984	Poly O'Keefe		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2811.A_House_Like_a_Lotus
