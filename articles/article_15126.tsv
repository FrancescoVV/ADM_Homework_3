Her Mad Hatter	Kingdom #1	Marie Hall	3.78	7750	968	Alice is all grown up. Running the Mad Hatter's Cupcakery and Tea Shoppe is a delicious job, until fate--and a fairy godmother with a weakness for bad boys--throws her a curveball. Now, Alice is the newest resident of Wonderland, where the Mad Hatter fuels her fantasies and thrills her body with his dark touch. The Mad Hatter may have a voice and a body made for sex, but he takes no lovers. Ever. But a determined fairy godmother has forced Alice into Wonderland--and his arms. Now, as desire and madness converge, the Hatter must decide if he will fight the fairy godmother's mating--or fight for Alice. 39,500 words	137	July 7th 2012	Alice Hu, 'Mad' Hatter, 'fairy godmother' Danika		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17413115-her-mad-hatter
