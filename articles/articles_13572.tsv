The Indian Bride	Konrad Sejer #5	Karin Fossum, Charlotte Barslund	3.80	6532	629	When perpetual bachelor Gunder Jomann goes to India for two weeks and comes home married, the town of Elvestad is stunned. On the day the Indian bride is supposed to arrive, the battered body of a woman is found in a meadow on the outskirts of town. None of the "good people of Elvestad" can believe that anyone among them would be capable of such a brutal murder. But in his quiet, formal way, Inspector Konrad Sejer understands that good people can commit atrocious deeds, and that no one is altogether innocent—including the café owner who knows too much, the girl who wants to be a chief witness, and the bodybuilder with no outlet for his terrible strength. Another brilliantly conceived, dark novel from one of Europe’s most successful crime writers.	297	2000	Konrad Sejer, Jacob Skarre, Gunder Jomann, Poona Bai	Norway, India	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/280352.The_Indian_Bride
