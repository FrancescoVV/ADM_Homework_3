The Year I Turned Sixteen	The Year I Turned Sixteen #1-4	Diane Schwemm	4.15	2070	196	Turning sixteen is an unforgettable milestone, and each of these four sisters has her own story to tell. Rose, the oldest, feels like she has the most responsibility when her father dies, and yearns to be true to herself. Daisy wants to break free from her family, but trouble arises when she falls for a bad boy. Laurel struggles with the loss of a close relative and finds herself drawn to a boy who may actually understand. And Lily, the youngest sister, feels like nothing could be more difficult than actually being herself. These four books in one special bind-up make for a great valueâ€”and an even better read.	720	January 4th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6620479-the-year-i-turned-sixteen
