Fracture Me	Shatter Me #2.5	Tahereh Mafi	3.71	38241	3965	As Omega Point prepares to launch an all-out assault on The Reestablishment soldiers stationed in Sector 45, Adam's focus couldn't be further from the upcoming battle. He's reeling from his breakup with Juliette, scared for his best friend's life, and as concerned as ever for his brother James's safety. And just as Adam begins to wonder if this life is really for him, the alarms sound. It's time for war. On the battlefield, it seems like the odds are in their favorâ€”but taking down Warner, Adam's newly discovered half brother, won't be that easy. The Reestablishment can't tolerate a rebellion, and they'll do anything to crush the resistance... including killing everyone Adam has ever cared about. Fracture Me sets the stage for Ignite Me , the explosive finale in Tahereh Mafi's epic dystopian series. Set during and soon after the final moments of Unravel Me , Fracture Me is told from Adam's perspective.	72	December 17th 2013	Aaron Warner Anderson, James Kent		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17331518-fracture-me
