He finds himself teaching students in a small town who are completely different than any students he has ever taught . He also finds himself alone as an American.He quickly becomes immersed in a culture whose people are the friendliest he has ever seen. He soon meets and falls in love with an Indian girl who lives two hundred miles away in Muscat. His sense of humor and his writing style make My Year in Oman, and Another Year in Oman, two of the best books you will ever read.	538	September 21st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931598-my-year-in-oman
