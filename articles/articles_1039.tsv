Destined for an Early Grave	Night Huntress #4	Jeaniene Frost	4.33	79202	2680	Her dreams leave her in grave danger… Since half-vampire Cat Crawfield and her undead lover Bones met six years ago, they’ve fought against the rogue undead, battled a vengeful Master vampire, and pledged their devotion with a blood bond. Now it’s time for a vacation. But their hopes for a perfect Paris holiday are dashed when Cat awakes one night in terror. She’s having visions of a vampire named Gregor who’s more powerful than Bones and has ties to her past that even Cat herself didn’t know about. Gregor believes Cat is his and he won’t stop until he has her. As the battle begins between the vamp who haunts her nightmares and the one who has her heart, only Cat can break Gregor’s hold over her. She’ll need all the power she can summon in order to bring down the baddest bloodsucker she’s ever faced … even if getting that power will result in an early grave.	355	July 15th 2009	Denise MacGregor, Bones (Night Huntress series), Catherine Crawfield-Russell, Spade (Night Huntress series), Mencheres, Tate Bradley, Vlad Tepesh	Paris (France), Bavaria (Germany), Austria, French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana (United States) London, England (United Kingdom) Orlando, Florida (United States) Richmond, Virginia (United States) Tennessee (United States), French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), London, England (United Kingdom), Orlando, Florida (United States), Richmond, Virginia (United States), Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5604848-destined-for-an-early-grave
