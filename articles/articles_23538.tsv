The Breeds Of Man		F.M. Busby	3.67	86	9	The Mark Twos were a breed apart, similar to other humans in every way but one: a survival adaptation different from any seen before. When it was discovered how remarkable that adaptation was, the implications were staggering...Because in a world where fear and suspicion reigned, where disease limited population growth, and where survival of the human race depended on a cure for that disease, the Mark Twos were the answer: not a cure, but a new kind of humanity. Here is the extraordinary story of Humanity Mark Two's struggle for survival in the fearful, suspicious world. With vivid, fast-moving prose, F.M. Busby unfolds the adventure of Humanity's confrontation with its own startling future.	294	February 1st 1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1082318.The_Breeds_Of_Man
