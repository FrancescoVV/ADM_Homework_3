The Iron Queen	The Iron Fey #3	Julie Kagawa	4.21	97424	4932	My name is Meghan Chase. I thought it was over. That my time with the fey, the impossible choices I had to make, the sacrifices of those I loved, was behind me. But a storm is approaching, an army of Iron fey that will drag me back, kicking and screaming. Drag me away from the banished prince who's sworn to stand by my side. Drag me into the core of conflict so powerful, I'm not sure anyone can survive it. This time, there will be no turning back.	384	January 25th 2011	Puck, Meghan Chase, Grimalkin, Ash - Ashallayn' Darkmyr Tallyn, Queen Mab, King Oberon	Nimmernie	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8685612-the-iron-queen
