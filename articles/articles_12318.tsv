Mockingbird		Walter Tevis	4.14	5145	556	Mockingbird is a powerful novel of a future world where humans are dying. Those that survive spend their days in a narcotic bliss or choose a quick suicide rather than slow extinction. Humanity's salvation rests with an android who has no desire to live, and a man and a woman who must discover love, hope, and dreams of a world reborn.	288	1980		New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/323172.Mockingbird
