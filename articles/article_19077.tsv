Dragonkyn		Nathan Smith Jones	4.18	78	37	In his very pores, a new relationship was forming with the gaseous alien called fire that ate and breathed as he did, and somehow he knew this relationship would change his life forever. Marc Mondragon is just an average teenager who’s always getting in trouble or crushing on the pretty girl in school. When strange things begin happening to him, Marc is thrust into a new world where dragons are no longer just in fairy tales. Suddenly, with new friends and new enemies, his very survival depends on his ability to use a new source of power that gives magic to and connects all dragons—the invisible fire within him.	212	February 1st 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32560839-dragonkyn
