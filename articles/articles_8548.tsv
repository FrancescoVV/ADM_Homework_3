Red Sorghum		Mo Yan, Howard Goldblatt	3.76	5613	691	Spanning three generations, this novel of family and myth is told through a series of flashbacks that depict events of staggering horror set against a landscape of gemlike beauty, as the Chinese battle both Japanese invaders and each other in the turbulent 1930s. A legend in China, where it won major literary awards and inspired an Oscar-nominated film, Red Sorghum is a book in which fable and history collide to produce fiction that is entirely new and unforgettable.	359	May 1987	余占鳌, 豆官, 奶奶, 我	China	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/894154.Red_Sorghum
