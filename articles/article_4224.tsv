Rules of Prey	Lucas Davenport #1	John Sandford	4.11	75831	2237	The "maddog" murderer who is terrorizing the Twin Cities is two things: insane and extremely intelligent. He kills for the pleasure of it and thoroughly enjoys placing elaborate obstacles to keep police befuddled. Each clever move he makes is another point of pride. But when the brilliant Lieutenant Lucas Davenport--a dedicated cop and a serial killer's worst nightmare--is brought in to take up the investigation, the maddog suddenly has an adversary worthy of his genius.	479	1989	Lucas Davenport, Jennifer Carey, Quentin Daniel, Sister Mary Joseph, Carla Ruiz, maddog, Annie McGowan, Harmon Anderson, Jennie Lewis, Frank Lester, Lyle Wullfolk, Harold Roe, Mary Rice, Detective Sloan, Jimmy Smithe, Heather Brown	Minneapolis, Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37301.Rules_of_Prey
