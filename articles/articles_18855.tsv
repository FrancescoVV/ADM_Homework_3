The Book of Houdini		Harry Houdini, Nevetz Azraz	4.67	3	0	The Book of Houdini contains three publications, all focusing on magic, and the great work of Harry Houdini. The first volume was authored in 1922, and is titled 'Houdini, The Adventurous Life of a Versatile Artist', and is a glance at just that. The second installment was written in 1908 by Houdini, who penned a work on 'The Unmasking of Robert Houdin', a study of Robert Houdin's alleged magical abilities. Book III, written in 1920, and the final volume in The Book of Houdini, is called 'Miracle Mongers & Thier Methods', where Harry again analyzes and exposes the tricks behind magic, while sharing the secrets behind some of his own.	466	May 13th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35132746-the-book-of-houdini
