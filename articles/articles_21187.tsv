Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge		Karl Popper, Giuliano Pancaldi	4.16	1414	60	Conjectures and Refutations is one of Karl Popper's most wide-ranging and popular works, notable not only for its acute insight into the way scientific knowledge grows, but also for applying those insights to politics and to history. It provides one of the clearest and most accessible statements of the fundamental idea that guided his work: not only our knowledge, but our aims and our standards, grow through an unending process of trial and error.	582	1963			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61554.Conjectures_and_Refutations
