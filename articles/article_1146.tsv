Old Yeller	Old Yeller #1	Fred Gipson	4.08	86341	2214	At first, Travis couldn't stand the sight of Old Yeller. The stray dog was ugly, and a thieving rascal, too. But he sure was clever, and a smart dog could be a big help on the wild Texas frontier, especially with Papa away on a long cattle drive up to Abilene. Strong and courageous, Old Yeller proved that he could protect Travis's family from any sort of danger. But can Travis do the same for Old Yeller?	132	January 1st 1958	Old Yeller (Dog)	Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130580.Old_Yeller
