Savannah Blues	Weezie and Bebe Mysteries #1	Mary Kay Andrews	3.99	19408	1300	Meet Weezie (aka Eloise) Foley, a feisty antiques “picker,” banished by her spiteful ex-husband from the house she herself restored in Savannah’s historic district, who must come to terms with a life that has suddenly changed…and not, it seems, for the better. In Mary Kay Andrews’s delectable New York Times bestseller, Savannah Blues, readers will feel the sultry Georgia breezes and taste sea salt in the air, as they lose themselves in a wonderful, witty tale brimming with sass and peopled by a richly endearing cast of delightfully eccentric characters. Revenge is sweeter than sweet in Mary Kay’s capable hands, and readers of Fannie Flagg, Adriana Trigiani, Emily Giffin, Rebecca Wells, and Jill Conner Browne will definitely want to spend some quality time in Savannah.	404	2002	Talmadge Evans III, Eloise "Weezie" Foley, Caroline DeSantos, Uncle James, Daniel Stipanek	Savannah, Georgia (United States), Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38030.Savannah_Blues
