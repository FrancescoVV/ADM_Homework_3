Shelley: Poems		Percy Bysshe Shelley	4.24	349	20	Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), perhaps the most intellectually adventurous of the great Romantic poets, personified the richly various- and contradictory- energies of his time. A classicist, a headlong visionary, a social radical, and a poet of serene artistry with a lyric touch second to none, Shelley gave voice to English romanticism's deepest aspirations.	256	November 2nd 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/573346.Shelley
