Closer		Patrick Marber	3.99	4339	131	In Closer, Patrick Marber has created a brilliant exploration into the brutal anatomy of modern romance, where a quartet of strangers meet, fall in love, and become caught up in a web of sexual desire and betrayal. Closer is hailed as one of the best plays of the nineties, and as the London Observer noted, it "has wired itself into the cultural vocabulary in a way that few plays have ever done."	120	November 3rd 1997		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51670.Closer
