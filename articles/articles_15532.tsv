Wards of Faerie	The Dark Legacy of Shannara #1	Terry Brooks	4.05	7338	547	Tumultuous times are upon the world now known as the Four Lands. Users of magic are in conflict with proponents of science. The dwindling Druid order is threatened with extinction. A sinister politician has used treachery and murder to rise as prime minister of the mighty Federation. Meanwhile, poring through a long-forgotten diary, the young Druid Aphenglow Elessedil has stumbled upon the secret account of an Elven girl’s heartbreak and the shocking truth about the vanished Elfstones, which once warded the lands and kept evil at bay. But never has a little knowledge been so very dangerous—as Aphenglow quickly learns when she’s set upon by assassins. Yet there can be no turning back from the road to which fate has steered her. Whoever captures the Elfstones and their untold powers will surely hold the advantage in the devastating clash to come.	366	August 21st 2012	Aphenglow Elessedil, Drust Chazhul, Stoon, Khyber Elessedil, Ard Rhys, Railing Ohmsford, Redden Ohmsford, Oriantha		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13265092-wards-of-faerie
