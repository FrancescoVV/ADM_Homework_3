Descent into Hell		Charles  Williams	3.97	1921	188	The key to Williams' mystically oriented theological thought, Descent into Hell (arguably Williams' greatest novel) is a multidimensional story about human beings who shut themselves up in their own narcissistic projections, so that they are no longer able to love, to 'co-inhere.' The result is a veritable hell.	222	January 1st 1937			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/960493.Descent_into_Hell
