Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Close Up		Bob Colacello	3.96	602	41	From Library Journal The former editor of Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Colacello has an insider's story to tell. This book is as bitchy and packed with names as its readers could want. The Andy Warhol Factory is described (not surprisingly) as an exploitative place where Andy got richer and richer while his drones worked harder and harder. Colacello's straightforward chronology of working and partying in Warhol's circle is tinged by his bitterness over a heavy workload and little pay at the Factory. His tone captures perfectly the self-obsessed philosophy that drove Warhol, his hangers-on, and the subculture of sex, drugs, parties, discos, and the New York art scene of the 1970s and early 1980s. Recommended for academic, art, and public libraries. Photos not seen.
