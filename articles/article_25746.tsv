The Lost Clue		Mrs. O.F. Walton	4.38	218	27	In this intriguing mystery, Captain Fortesque finds himself torn between two loyalties. Having been educated in the finest schools of England, he enjoyed acceptance in high society, but kept his true upbringing a secret. Then the day came that changed the course of his life. It all started with the mysterious note that could only be read after his father’s death. Will he be able to endure the dramatic challenges he will now face? In the meantime, everything in Daisy Bank seemed crooked and out of shape. Across stretches of dark stagnant water, Marjorie wandered over the wilderness of ashes, wondering how anything could grow in such poor and barren soil. But she learns that even in the midst of that bleak, coal-mining region, she can be ‘a tree of the Lord’s planting,’ bringing sunshine and growth to the dark, dreary world in which she finds herself.	288	1907	Kenneth Fortescue, Marjorie Douglas	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2045705.The_Lost_Clue
