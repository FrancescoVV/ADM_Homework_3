The Book of Counted Sorrows		Dean Koontz	4.25	2382	41	The Book of Counted Sorrows being the mind=bending, heart-stopping, bowel-freezing, spleen-tickling history of the most dangerous book of poetry ever written, including the text of that cursed book itself, with the prayer that God will protect you from a spontaneous head explosion (and even worse potential fates) if you dare read it.
