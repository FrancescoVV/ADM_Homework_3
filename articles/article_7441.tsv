Venus in Furs		Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Larry Wolff, Joachim Neugroschel	3.65	10597	806	'Venus in Furs' describes the obsessions of Severin von Kusiemski, a European nobleman who desires to be enslaved to a woman. Severin finds his ideal of voluptuous cruelty in the merciless Wanda von Dunajew. This is a passionate and powerful portrayal of one man's struggle to enlighten and instruct himself and others in the realm of desire. Published in 1870, the novel gained notoriety and a degree of immortality for its author when the word "masochism" - derived from his name - entered the vocabulary of psychiatry. This remains a classic literary statement on sexual submission and control.	160	1870	Severin von Kusiemski, Wanda von Dunajew	Florence (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/427354.Venus_in_Furs
