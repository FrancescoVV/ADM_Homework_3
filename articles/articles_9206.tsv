Joy in the Morning	Jeeves #8	P.G. Wodehouse	4.34	8459	663	Trapped in rural Steeple Bumpleigh, a man less stalwart than Bertie Wooster would probably give way at the knees, for among those present were Florence Craye, to whom Bertie had once been engaged; her new fiance "Stilton" Cheesewright, who sees Bertie as a snake in the grass; and that biggest blot on the landscape, Edwin the Boy Scout, who is busy doing acts of kindness out of sheer malevolence. All of Bertie's forebodings are fully justified, for in his efforts to oil the wheels of commerce, promote the course of true love, and avoid the consequences of a vendetta, he becomes the prey of all and sundry. In fact only Jeeves can save him.	272	1947	Reginald Jeeves, Bertram Wilberforce Wooster, Agatha Wooster, Percival Craye, Stilton Cheesewright, Florence Craye, George Webster Fittleworth, Cyril Fotheringay-Phipps, Frederick Fotheringay Widgeon, Zenobia Hopwood, J.
