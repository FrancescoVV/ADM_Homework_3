Manners & Mutiny	Finishing School #4	Gail Carriger	4.23	13668	1654	If one must flirt...flirt with danger. Lessons in the art of espionage aboard Mademoiselle Geraldine's floating dirigible have become tedious without Sophronia's sootie Soap nearby. She would rather thwart dastardly Picklemen, yet her concerns about their wicked intentions are ignored. Who can she trust? Royal werewolf dewan? Stylish vampire Lord Akeldama? Only one thing is certain: a large-scale plot is under way. Sophronia must be ready to save her friends, her school, and all of London from disaster.	326	November 3rd 2015	Sophronia Temminnick, Dimity Plumleigh-Teignmott, Pillover Plumleigh-Teignmott, Monique de Pelouse, Lady Linette de Limmone, Aloysius Braithwope, Lord Akeldama, Genevieve Lefoux		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18725742-manners-mutiny
