Laid Bare	Brown Family #1	Lauren Dane	3.90	13138	814	Unexpected Desire... It's been ten years since clean-cut, sexy-as-hell police officer Todd Keenan had a white-hot fling with Erin Brown, the provocative, wild rocker chick next door. Their power exchange in the bedroom got under his skin. But love wasn't in the cards just yet... Now, life has thrown the pair back together. But picking up where they left off is tough, in light of a painful event from Erin's past. As Todd struggles to earn her trust, their relationship takes an unexpected and exciting turn when Todd's best friend, Ben, ends up in their bed--and all three are quite satisfied in this relationship without a name. As the passion they share transforms Erin, will it be enough to help her face the evil she thought she had left behind?	336	2009	Erin Brown, Todd Keenan, Ben Copeland, Brody Brown, Ella Tipton, Andrew Copeland, Adrian Brown	Seattle, Washington (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6100797-laid-bare
