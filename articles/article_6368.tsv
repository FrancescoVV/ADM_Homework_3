The Twelve Caesars	The Lives of the Twelve Caesars #1-12	Suetonius, Michael Grant, Robert Graves	4.00	17193	604	As private secretary to the Emperor Hadrian, Suetonius gained access to the imperial archives and used them (along with eye-witness accounts) to produce one of the most colorful biographical works in history. The Twelve Caesars chronicles the public careers and private lives of the men who wielded absolute power over Rome, from the foundation of the empire under Julius Caesar and Augustus, to the decline into depravity and civil war under Nero, and the recovery that came with his successors. A masterpiece of anecdote, wry observation and detailed physical description, The Twelve Caesars presents us with a gallery of vividly drawn — and all too human — individuals. Robert Graves's celebrated translation, sensitively revised by Michael Grant, captures all the wit and immediacy of Suetonius' original.	363	121	Nero (emperor), Caligula, Lucius Livius Ocella Servius Sulpicius Galba, Titus Flavius Domitianus, Marcus Salvius Otho, Tiberius Claudius Caesar, Titus (emperor), Titus Flavius Vespasianus, Aulus Vitellius, Augustus, Julius Caesar		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29022.The_Twelve_Caesars
