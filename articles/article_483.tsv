Chosen	House of Night #3	P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast	3.91	222881	4404	Dark forces are at work at the House of Night and Zoey Redbird’s adventures at the school take a mysterious turn. Her best friend, Stevie Rae, is undead and struggling to maintain a grip on her humanity. Zoey finds herself in the very unexpected and rare situation of having three boyfriends. Mix a little bloodlust into the equation and the situation has the potential to spell social disaster. Just when it seems things couldn’t get any tougher, vampyres start turning up dead. Really dead. It looks like the People of Faith are tired of living side-by-side with vampyres. But, as Zoey and her friends so often find out, how things appear rarely affects the truth…	307	March 4th 2008	Zoey Redbird, Nyx (House of Night), Erik Night, Stevie Rae Johnson, Neferet, Heath Luck, Aphrodite LaFont, Sylvia Redbird, Loren Blake, Erin Bates, Shaunee Cole, Damien Maslin, Jack Twist, Darius Langley	Tulsa, Oklahoma (United States), Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1326258.Chosen
