The Opal Deception	Artemis Fowl #4	Eoin Colfer	4.04	128871	2070	The evil pixie Opal Koboi has spent the last year in a self-induced coma, plotting her revenge on all those who foiled her attempt to destroy the LEPrecon fairy police. And Artemis Fowl is at the top of her list. After his last run-in with the fairies, Artemis had his mind wiped of his memories of the world belowground. But they have not forgotten about him. Once again, he must stop the human and fairy worlds from colliding—only this time, Artemis faces an enemy who may have finally outsmarted him.	416	April 30th 2005	Artemis Fowl II, Domovoi Butler, Captain Holly Short, Commander Julius Root, Foaly, Mulch Diggums, Angeline Fowl, Opal Koboi, Artemis Fowl Sr., Captain Trouble Kelp, Ark Sool, Wing Commander Vinyáya, Corporal Grub Kelp, Dr Jerbal Argon, Chix Verbil, Brill Brothers, Giovanni Zito		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114954.The_Opal_Deception
