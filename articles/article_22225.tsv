Once Is Not Enough		Jacqueline Susann	3.72	7740	184	Once upon a time, the entertainment industry was a world that never slept. Magazine editors, models, pop stars, and all the rest visited "vitamin doctors" to get the shots that would allow them to stay up all night and then work all day--in offices decorated with beanbag chairs and Calderesque mobiles. In this world, January Wayne goes from poor-little-rich-girl to grown-up swinger, as she searches New York and Los Angeles for a guy just like Mike Wayne, the glamorous movie producer, who also just happens to be her father.	467	1973			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131155.Once_Is_Not_Enough
