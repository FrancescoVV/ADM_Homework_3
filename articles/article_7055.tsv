Daja's Book	Circle of Magic #3	Tamora Pierce	4.10	27595	443	Outcast Trader Daja, along with her fellow mages-in-training, journeys from Winding Circle to the Gold Ridge Mountains, where drought threatens widespread famine. There, Daja creates an astonishing object: a living metal vine, and Daja's dealings with her former people reawaken a longing for familiar ways. Daja must choose - should she return to the Traders or remain with the Winding Circle folk who have become her family?	232	October 1st 1998	Rosethorn, Sandrilene fa Toren, Trisana Chandler, Briar Moss, Daja Kisubo, Niklaren Goldeye, Frostpine, Lark		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58894.Daja_s_Book
