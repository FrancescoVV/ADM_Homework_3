Resurrection	Wicked #5	Nancy Holder, Debbie Vigui√©	3.96	10500	218	Who is Alex Carruthers? That is the question Wicked fans have been asking for nearly six years. Spellbound , the fourth and seemingly final book in the Wicked series, originally published in 2003, left readers on the edge of their seats with a classic cliffhanger ending. But now, as new fans of the bind-up editions of the series begin to ask the same question, the true and final conclusion to the Wicked series will emerge. And all their questions will be answered in this heart-stopping, magical adventure about witches, destiny, and the beyond.	402	June 30th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5989059-resurrection
