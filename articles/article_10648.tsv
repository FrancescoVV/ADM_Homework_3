It is a voluminous text of 1430 pages, compiled and composed during the period of Sikh gurus, from 1469 to 1708. The text remains the holy scripture of the Sikhs, regarded as the teachings of the Ten Gurus. The role of Guru Granth Sahib, as a source or guide of prayer, is pivotal in Sikh worship. It is written in the Gurmukhī script, in various dialects – including Lehndi Punjabi, Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Sanskrit and Persian – often coalesced under the generic title of Sant Bhasha.	1430	October 1708			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3263334-sri-guru-granth-sahib
