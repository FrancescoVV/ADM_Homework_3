Cambodia and the Year of UNTAC (Essential Essays Book 67)		Tom Riddle	4.00	4	2	This is the untold story of what went on behind the scenes when the UN tried to manage free elections in Cambodia in the early 90s. Told with insight, humor, and a dash of romance, Cambodia and the Year of UNTAC staggers from adventure to adventure as the UN seeks to bring hope to a country reeling from war. With deep feelings for the Cambodian people, this true-life tale -- now in a new edition with additional photos and a special afterword -- brings to life what it was like to be part of the team that ended Cambodia's civil war and helped bring stability to that beautiful country.	268	September 1st 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36443556-cambodia-and-the-year-of-untac
