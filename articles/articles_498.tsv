North and South		Elizabeth Gaskell	4.13	144700	7388	When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the north of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In North and South , Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fuses individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale creates one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.	521	January 1855	Margaret Hale, Frederick Hale, Mr. Hale, Mrs. Hale, Mr. Bell, Dixon, Mrs. Hannah Thornton, Fanny Thornton, Bessy Higgins, Nicholas Higgins, John Thornton	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156538.North_and_South
