The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.		Martin Luther King Jr., Clayborne Carson	4.30	17959	703	Using Stanford University's voluminous collection of archival material, including previously unpublished writings, interviews, recordings, and correspondence, King scholar Clayborne Carson has constructed a remarkable first-person account of Dr. King's extraordinary life. Beginning with his boyhood, the book portrays King's education as a minister, his ascendancy as a leader of the Montgomery bus boycott, his pivotal role in the civil rights demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and his complex relationship with the Kennedy brothers, LBJ, Malcolm X, and numerous other leading figures of the day.	400	August 1986	Martin Luther King		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42547.The_Autobiography_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr_
