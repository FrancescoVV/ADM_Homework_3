Forever & The Power of One	Forever #1-2	Eve Newton	3.77	1211	148	I would die for my family, if only I could die. After a thousand years of being a Vampire, I have seen and done everything, twice. And then a third time for good measure. I am demanding, a tad selfish, and a teeny bit vain. But at least I know my faults. I love the men in my life, each in different ways. Together we must solve the puzzle of the mysterious prophecy that has been thrust upon us, but at what cost? The journey just might bring us closer together, not only in my dreams but in reality. Will I get to have everything that I want? Or will the truth only serve to complicate my already confusing life? Who knows? This is my story. Expect trouble. It's my middle name.
