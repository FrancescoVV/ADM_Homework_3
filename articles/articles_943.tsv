Lover Enshrined	Black Dagger Brotherhood #6	J.R. Ward	4.12	106528	4297	In this "frighteningly addictive" paranormal romance saga there's a war raging between vampires and their slayers. Here are the stories of a secret band of brothers like no otherâ€”six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. And now a dutiful twin must choose between two lives... Fiercely loyal to the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Phury has sacrificed himself for the good of the race, becoming the male responsible for keeping the Brotherhood's bloodlines alive. As Primale of the Chosen, he is obligated to father the sons and daughters who will ensure that the traditions of the race survive, and that there are warriors to fight those who want all vampires extinguished. As his first mate, the Chosen Cormia wants to win not only his body, but his heart for herself. She is drawn to the noble responsibility behind the emotionally scarred male. But Phury has never allowed himself to know pleasure or joy. As the war with the Lessening Society grows grim, tragedy looms over the Brotherhood's mansion, and Phury must decide between duty and love....	560	June 3rd 2008	Zsadist, Bella Soang, Phury, Cormia, John Matthew, Xhexania, Qhuinn, Blaylock, Tohrment, Rehvenge, Lash, The Scribe Virgin, Mr. D, Nalla, Wrath (Blind King)	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1240662.Lover_Enshrined
