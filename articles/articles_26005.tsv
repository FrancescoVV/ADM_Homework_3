Say You Love Me	Malory-Anderson Families #5	Johanna Lindsey	4.11	12896	439	Left penniless and in dire straits, Kelsey Langton realizes that only by allowing herself to be sold at auction can she rescue her sister's future. So the proud, desperate lady enters the infamous House of Eros, resigned to becoming some well-heeled gentleman's plaything -- and Lord Derek Malory is the highest bidder for Kelsey's charms. A handsome and irredeemable scoundrel, Derek soon draws the sensuous, unsuspecting maiden into a world of unparalleled pleasures and dangerous rivalries. But Kelsey knows she must always guard the secret of her highborn past -- even as her grace, spirit, and beauty entice her new "master" to renounce his scandalous ways and take a gamble on true love.	413	1996	Regina Ashton, Nicholas Eden, Viscount of Montieth, Anthony Malory, Roslynn Chadwick, Jeremy Malory, Georgina Anderson, James Malory, Amy Malory, Warren Anderson, Derek Malory, Kelsey Longton	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301823.Say_You_Love_Me
