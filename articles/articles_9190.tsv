The Book of Lost Tales, Part One	The History of Middle-Earth #1	J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien	3.84	12920	336	The Book of Lost Tales 1 stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor. Embedded in English legend and English association, they were set in the narratve frame of a great westward voyage over the Ocean by a mariner named Eriol (or Ælfwine) to Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle, where Elves dwelt; from them he learned their true story, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse . In the Tales are found the earliest accounts and original ideas of Gods and Elves; Dwarves and Orcs; the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; Nargothrond and Gondolin; and the geography and cosmology of the invented world.	367	1984	Eriol, Rúmil		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7347.The_Book_of_Lost_Tales_Part_One
