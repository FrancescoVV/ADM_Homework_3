Long Day's Journey into Night		Eugene O'Neill, Harold Bloom	4.07	35066	971	Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night is regarded as his finest work. First published by Yale University Press in 1956, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 and has since sold more than one million copies. This edition includes a new foreword by Harold Bloom. The action covers a fateful, heart-rending day from around 8:30 am to midnight, in August 1912 at the seaside Connecticut home of the Tyrones - the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents at their home, Monte Cristo Cottage. One theme of the play is addiction and the resulting dysfunction of the family. All three males are alcoholics and Mary is addicted to morphine. They all constantly conceal, blame, resent, regret, accuse and deny in an escalating cycle of conflict with occasional desperate and half-sincere attempts at affection, encouragement and consolation.	179	July 1st 1956	Edmund Tyrone, Mary Tyrone, James Tyrone, Jamie Tyrone	Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12083.Long_Day_s_Journey_into_Night
