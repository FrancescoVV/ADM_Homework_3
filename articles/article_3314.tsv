Death Masks	The Dresden Files #5	Jim Butcher	4.29	118619	3407	Harry Dresden, Chicago's only practicing professional wizard, should be happy that business is pretty good for a change. But now he's getting more than he bargained for: A duel with the Red Court of Vampires' champion, who must kill Harry to end the war between vampires and wizards... Professional hit men using Harry for target practice... The missing Shroud of Turin... A handless and headless corpse the Chicago police need identified... Not to mention the return of Harry's ex-girlfriend Susan, who's still struggling with her semi-vampiric nature. And who seems to have a new man in her life. Some days, it just doesn't pay to get out of bed. No matter how much you're charging.	432	August 1st 2003	Thomas Raith, Molly Carpenter, Susan Rodriguez, Michael Carpenter, Ebenezer McCoy, "Gentleman" John Marcone, Charity Carpenter, Jared Kincaid, Sanya, Karrin Murphy, Harry Dresden, Father Anthony Forthill	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91479.Death_Masks
