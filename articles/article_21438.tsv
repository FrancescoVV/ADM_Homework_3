Missing		Kelley Armstrong	3.90	2682	435	From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Kelley Armstrong comes a new romantic thriller that will leave fans trembling for more. The only thing Winter Crane likes about Reeve's End is that soon she'll leave it. Like her best friend did. Like her sister did. Like most of the teens born in town have done. There's nothing for them there but abandoned mines and empty futures. They're better off taking a chance elsewhere. The only thing Winter will miss is the woods. Her only refuge. At least it was. Until the day she found Lennon left for dead, bleeding in a tree. But now Lennon is gone too. And he has Winter questioning what she once thought was true. What if nobody left at all? What if they're all missing? "Like Stephen King, who manages an under-the-covers, flashlight-in-face kind of storytelling without sounding ridiculous, Armstrong not only writes interesting page-turners, she has also achieved that unlikely goal, what all writers strive for: a genre of her own." â€” The Walrus	384	April 18th 2017	Edie Greene, Winter Crane, Tanner Robson, Lennon Bishop, Jude Bishop, Peter Bishop		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25487124-missing
