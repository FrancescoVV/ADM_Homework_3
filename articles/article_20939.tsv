No One To Trust (No Way Out Book 3)		Olivia Hauvuy, Jane McNulty	5.00	2	0	In the final installment of the riveting No Way Out series, death lurks around every corner. And while bonds are broken and put back together, Lanaya, Cara, and friends know that they can’t keep narrowly escaping--there won’t always be a way out for them. Confusion takes over, but one thing is for sure: not everyone will make it out of this alive.	120	November 13th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27871551-no-one-to-trust
