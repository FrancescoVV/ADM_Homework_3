In "Reckless Little 15" she went from being an insecure, naive girl, to being an abused, frightened, and angry teen. Finally working up the courage to try to get her life back, Carleigh is determined to escape from a life of lies and abuse. She does anything she can think of to get rid of her husband, Richard. Plunging into depths she never envisioned. Unfortunately, the most major attempt backfires, resulting in the death of an innocent child. Carleigh finds herself on the wrong side of the law, and feeling worse about herself and life - something she never thought possible. A victim herself, she cannot see what she is doing to those who love her until the damage has already been inflicted. When all is said and done, will there be anybody left to catch her when she falls? All books in the Carleigh's Confessions series are based on actual events. Names, places and professions have been changed to protect the parties involved.	248	September 8th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18581480-sacrificing-16-part-1
