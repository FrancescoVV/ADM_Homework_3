Holidays on Ice		David Sedaris	3.92	109761	5668	David Sedaris's beloved holiday collection is new again with six more pieces, including a never before published story. Along with such favorites as the diaries of a Macy's elf and the annals of two very competitive families, are Sedaris's tales of tardy trick-or-treaters ( Us and Them ); the difficulties of explaining the Easter Bunny to the French ( Jesus Shaves ); what to do when you've been locked out in a snowstorm ( Let It Snow ); the puzzling Christmas traditions of other nations ( Six to Eight Black Men ); what Halloween at the medical examiner's looks like ( The Monster Mash ); and a barnyard secret Santa scheme gone awry ( Cow and Turkey ).	176	December 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4136.Holidays_on_Ice
