Terrifying Freedom		Linda Anne Smith, Erik Mohr	4.41	44	24	Truth can be illusive, choices disconcerting; the promise of moral certitude, irresistible. In the Midwestern offices of Secure Star Insurance, Rebecca, efficient and distant, seeks only to survive another day. Sally, earnest and devout, views the workplace as a fertile mission field. Into the agency comes a new employee, Gladys, gregarious, unorthodox and twice divorced. When an intuitive HR manager arrives, veneers begin to crack. To move beyond her smouldering estrangement Rebecca must come to terms with her past. Four years earlier she was Sr. Rebecca Marise, living in a convent replete with younger members and garnering the support of an increasing number of bishops and conservative Catholics. When an older nun has a heart attack, Rebecca is abruptly sent to a backwater mission in Appalachia. Distanced from the enclave of the motherhouse and embedded in social realities of the missionary outpost, Rebecca is thrust into uncharted waters.	500	October 28th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27434295-terrifying-freedom
