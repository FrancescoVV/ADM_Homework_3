Princess in Training	The Princess Diaries #6	Meg Cabot	3.72	29349	780	Princess FOR PRESIDENT! Student body president, that is - nominated by her power-mad best friend, Lilly. This is not how Mia imagined kicking off her sophomore year, but as usual, she has bigger problems to worry about, like Geometry. And now that Mia's one true love, Michael, is uptown at college, what's the point of even getting up for school in the morning? But the last straw is what Lana whispers to her on the lunch line about what college boys expect of their girlfriends. . . . Really, it's almost more than a princess in training can bear!	294	2006	Mia Thermopolis, Lilly Moscovitz, Michael Moscovitz, Boris Pelkowski, Tina Hakim Baba, Lana Weinberger		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93726.Princess_in_Training
