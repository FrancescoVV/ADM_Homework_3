The Painted Veil		W. Somerset Maugham	3.93	35645	3527	Set in England and Hong Kong in the 1920s, The Painted Veil is the story of the beautiful, but love-starved Kitty Fane. When her husband discovers her adulterous affair, he forces her to accompany him to the heart of a cholera epidemic. Stripped of the British society of her youth and the small but effective society she fought so hard to attain in Hong Kong, she is compelled by her awakening conscience to reassess her life and learn how to love. The Painted Veil is a beautifully written affirmation of the human capacity to grow, to change, and to forgive.	246	April 1925	Kitty Garstin, Charlie Townsend, Dorothy Townsend	Hong Kong, China, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99664.The_Painted_Veil
