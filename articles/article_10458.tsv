14,000 Things to Be Happy About: The Happy Book		Barbara Ann Kipfer, Pierre Le-Tan	4.04	2702	218	Flannel sheets. Strawberry ice cream. Making faces at monkeys in the zoo. Dog dishes that say "Good Dog." Carolers singing around a Norwegian spruce. Sun burning off the morning fog. Cabanas. It's the little things that make life worth living, and they can be found by the dozens in this obsessive, quirky, and utterly captivating compendium with over 950,000 copies in print. A pure, unadulterated listing, it offers not a single explanation, aside, or footnote, but reading it is as irresistible as eating popcorn. Randomly selected and catalogued over the course of twenty years-and illustrated with joyous and jewel-like precision by the gifted artist Pierre Le-Tan-14,000 THINGS is Barbara Ann Kipfer's perfect antidote to the all-too-frequently-mentioned things we should be unhappy about. It's a celebration of almost everything that's ever made us smile. And that itself is reason number 14,001.	610	January 4th 1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/667416.14_000_Things_to_Be_Happy_About
