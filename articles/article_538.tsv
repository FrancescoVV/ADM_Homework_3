Acheron	Dark-Hunter #14	Sherrilyn Kenyon	4.57	54872	3652	Eleven thousand years ago a god was born. Cursed into the body of a human, Acheron endured a lifetime of hatred. His human death unleashed an unspeakable horror that almost destroyed the earth. Brought back against his will, he became the sole defender of mankind. Only it was never that simple… For centuries, he has fought for our survival and hidden a past he never wants revealed. Now his survival, and ours, hinges on the very woman who threatens him. Old enemies reawaken and unite to kill them both. War has never been deadlier… or more fun.	728	August 5th 2008	Styxx of Didymos, Apollymi, Strykerius, Artemis Agrotera, Soteria "Tory" Eleni Athena Kafieri, Ryssa of Didymos, Jaden (Acheron), Apollo (Styxx), Acheron "Ash" Parthenopaeus	Greece, Atlantis, New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Nashville, Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2299110.Acheron
