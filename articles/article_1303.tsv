Masquerade	Blue Bloods #2	Melissa de la Cruz	3.91	86980	2166	Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions. A trip to Italy in search of her grandfather only serves to make things more confusing. What secrets are the leaders of The Committee hiding? Meanwhile, back in New York, preparations are feverishly underway for the famous Four Hundred Ball. In true Blue Blood fashion, the ball is totally fab, complete with masksâ€”and hidden behind this masquerade is a revelation that will change the course of a young vampireâ€™s destiny. The thrilling sequel in Melissa de la Cruzâ€™s vampire mythology has all the glamour, attitude, and vampire lore that made the first book a hit.	307	May 1st 2007	Schuyler Van Alen, Mimi Force, Bliss Llewellyn, Jack Force, Oliver Hazard-Perry		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106085.Masquerade
