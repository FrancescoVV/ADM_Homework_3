The Extraordinaries	The Extraordinaries #1	T.J. Klune	4.20	3288	1226	Some people are extraordinary. Some are just extra. TJ Klune's YA debut, The Extraordinaries, is a queer coming-of-age story about a fanboy with ADHD and the heroes he loves. Nick Bell? Not extraordinary. But being the most popular fanfiction writer in the Extraordinaries fandom is a superpower, right? After a chance encounter with Shadow Star, Nova City’s mightiest hero (and Nick’s biggest crush), Nick sets out to make himself extraordinary. And he’ll do it with or without the reluctant help of Seth Gray, Nick's best friend (and maybe the love of his life). Rainbow Rowell's Fangirl meets Marissa Meyer's Renegades in TJ Klune's YA debut.	405	July 14th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52380340-the-extraordinaries
