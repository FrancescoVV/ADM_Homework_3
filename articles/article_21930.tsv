A Damsel in Distress		P.G. Wodehouse	4.09	5300	567	When Maud Marsh flings herself into George Bevan’s cab in Piccadilly, he starts believing in damsels in distress. George traces his mysterious traveling companion to Belpher Castle, home of Lord Marshmoreton, where things become severely muddled. Maud’s aunt, Lady Caroline Byng, wants Maud to marry Reggie, her stepson. Maud, meanwhile, is known to be in love with an unknown American she met in Wales. So when George turns up speaking American, a nasty case of mistaken identity breaks out. In fact, the scene is set for the perfect Wodehouse comedy of errors.	216	October 4th 1919	John Marshmoreton, Percy Wilbraham Marsh, Patricia Maud Marsh, Caroline Byng, Keggs, Albert, Alice Faraday, MacPherson, Geoffrey Raymond, Mac, George Bevan, Billie Dore, Babe Sinclair, Spencer Gray, Rogers, Mrs. Digby, Cyril Ferguson, Edwin Plummer, Millie Plummer		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18057.A_Damsel_in_Distress
