The Shop on Blossom Street	Blossom Street #1	Debbie Macomber	4.05	29383	2020	Bestselling romance author and ardent knitter Debbie Macomber combines both her skills in this novel about a newly opened Seattle yarn shop and the knitting class that brings four women together to make baby blankets. The owner of the shop and her three students produce more than blankets, knitting together bonds of solidarity, friendship, love, hope, and renewal. The book even includes the pattern for the blanket, which was created by premier knitting designer Ann Norling. When Lydia Hoffman, a cancer survivor and owner of A Good Yarn, starts a knitting class for her patrons, she forms a special friendship and bond with three extraordinary women--Jacqueline, Carol, and Alix--and together they share laughter, heartbreak, and dreams.	416	April 27th 2003	Jacqueline Donovan, Lydia Hoffman, Carol Girard, Alix Townsend	Seattle, Washington (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233044.The_Shop_on_Blossom_Street
