A Clockwork Orange		Anthony Burgess	3.99	603440	13908	In Anthony Burgess's influential nightmare vision of the future, criminals take over after dark. Teen gang leader Alex narrates in fantastically inventive slang that echoes the violent intensity of youth rebelling against society. Dazzling and transgressive, A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil and the meaning of human freedom. This edition includes the controversial last chapter not published in the first edition, and Burgess’s introduction, “A Clockwork Orange Resucked.”	240	1962	Pete, Alex Jacobi, Georgie, Dim	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41817486-a-clockwork-orange
