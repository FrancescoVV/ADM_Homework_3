Metamorphosis	Book Boyfriend #1	Erin Noelle	4.14	12555	1156	Re-releasing on Jan 19, 2020 with new covers and edits Scarlett MacGregor has lived a very sheltered life courtesy of her over-the-top controlling parents. Having never been to a co-ed party, much less on a date, Scarlett has relied on her books, her music, and living vicariously through her best friend Evie to keep her sanity as she's patiently awaited her freedom from their rule. When Scarlett and Evie go away to college, Scarlett quickly meets Ashton, Dylan, and later, Mason, and is thrown into a crash course of like, love, and lust. With Evie's help, she must figure out the difference in the three and which one she wants before she ends up without any of them. **Recommended for readers 17+ due to sexual content and harsh language.**	254	January 18th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50405208-metamorphosis
