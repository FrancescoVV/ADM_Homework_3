On the Banks of Plum Creek	Little House #4	Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams	4.20	91568	1802	The adventures of Laura Ingalls and her family continue as they leave their little house on the prairie and travel in their covered wagon to Minnesota. They settle into a house made of sod on the banks of beautiful Plum Creek. Soon Pa builds them a sturdier house, with real glass windows and a hinged door. Laura and Mary go to school, help with the chores around the house, and fish in the creek. Pa’s fiddle lulls them all to sleep at the end of the day. But then disaster strikes—on top of a terrible blizzard, a grasshopper infestation devours their wheat crop. Now the family must work harder than ever to overcome these challenges.	358	1937	Laura Ingalls Wilder, Caroline Quiner Ingalls, Charles Ingalls, Mary Ingalls, Carrie Ingalls, Nellie Oleson, Eva Beadle	Walnut Grove, Minnesota (United States), Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7882.On_the_Banks_of_Plum_Creek
