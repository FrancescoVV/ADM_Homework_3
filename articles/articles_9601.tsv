Lola Rose		Jacqueline Wilson, Poppy D. Chusfani	3.85	8620	371	When life with Jayni's violent-tempered father becomes too frightening to cope with, Jayni, her mum and her little brother Kenny are forced to escape in the middle of the night. Slipping out of the house unseen, travelling up to London by train and checking into a hotel - it's almost like playing an elaborate game. They even make up false identities to protect their secret, and Jayni becomes the glamorous-sounding Lola Rose. But when money runs out and reality bites, what will they do next?	304	March 6th 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1482396.Lola_Rose
