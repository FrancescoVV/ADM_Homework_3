Where'd You Go, Bernadette		Maria Semple	3.89	482795	43146	Bernadette Fox has vanished. When her daughter Bee claims a family trip to Antarctica as a reward for perfect grades, Bernadette, a fiercely intelligent shut-in, throws herself into preparations for the trip. But worn down by years of trying to live the Seattle life she never wanted, Ms. Fox is on the brink of a meltdown. And after a school fundraiser goes disastrously awry at her hands, she disappears, leaving her family to pick up the pieces--which is exactly what Bee does, weaving together an elaborate web of emails, invoices, and school memos that reveals a secret past Bernadette has been hiding for decades. Where'd You Go Bernadette is an ingenious and unabashedly entertaining novel about a family coming to terms with who they are and the power of a daughter's love for her mother.	330	August 14th 2012	Bee Branch, Bernadette Fox, Elgin Branch, Manjula Kapoor, Audrey Griffin (Where'd You Go, Bernadette?), Soo-Lin Lee-Segal, Gwen Goodyear, Ollie Ordway, Kyle Griffin, Kennedy, Bee's friend, Dr. Janelle Kurtz, Warren Griffin	Seattle, Washington (United States), Antarctica	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13526165-where-d-you-go-bernadette
