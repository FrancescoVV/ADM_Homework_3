Pleasure Unbound	Demonica #1	Larissa Ione	4.05	50361	2560	In a place where ecstasy can cost you your life . . . She's a demon-slayer who hungers for sensual pleasure-but fears it will always be denied her. Until Tayla Mancuso lands in a hospital run by demons in disguise, and the head doctor, Eidolon, makes her body burn with unslakable desire. But to prove her ultimate loyalty to her peers, she must betray the surgeon who saved her life. Two lovers will dare to risk all. Eidolon cannot resist this fiery, dangerous woman who fills him with both rage and passion. Not only is she his avowed enemy, but she could very well be the hunter who has been preying upon his people. Torn between his need for the truth and his quest to find his perfect mate before a horrific transformation claims him forever, Eidolon will dare the unthinkable-and let Tayla possess him, body and soul . . .	389	July 1st 2008	Shade, Tayla Mancuso, Eidolon, Wraith (Demonica series), Kynan Morgan, Gemella Endri, Luc, Nancy Allen	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2679633-pleasure-unbound
