Messenger	The Giver  #3	Lois Lowry	3.91	112855	8022	Messenger is the masterful third novel in the Giver Quartet, which began with the dystopian bestseller The Giver, now a major motion picture. Matty has lived in Village and flourished under the guidance of Seer, a blind man known for his special sight. Village once welcomed newcomers, but something sinister has seeped into Village and the people have voted to close it to outsiders. Matty has been invaluable as a messenger. Now he must risk everything to make one last journey through the treacherous forest with his only weapon, a power he unexpectedly discovers within himself.	169	April 26th 2004	Jonas (Lois Lowry)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12930.Messenger
