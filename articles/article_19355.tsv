The Meghan O'Byrne Chronicle (Fall From Grace, #1)		F. Scott Andison	4.25	20	3	This remarkable story is about a girl - a singularly extraordinary girl - named Meghan O'Byrne. Meghan O'Byrne is special - very special - a healer and prophet in a world that does not believe in such things. Meghan's story unfolds the way it happened - not the way it should have happened or the way someone wished it would have happened. There are pleasant bits, but nasty, jarring parts as well. And things we don't like to think happen, but happen just the same. Book One â€“ Fall From Grace tells Meghan's story - from her beginning to her fall - a long and complicated tale full of loss and love, cruelty and kindness.	296	July 22nd 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43189596-the-meghan-o-byrne-chronicle
