A Time to Kill	Jake Brigance #1	John Grisham	4.08	706428	5362	Before "The Firm" and "The Pelican Brief" made him a superstar, John Grisham wrote this riveting story of retribution and justice. In this searing courtroom drama, best-selling author John Grisham probes the savage depths of racial violence, as he delivers a compelling tale of uncertain justice in a small southern town, Clanton, Mississippi. The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. Until her black father acquires an assault rifle and takes matters into his hands. For ten days, as burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life, and then his own.	515	1989	Jake Brigance, Carl Lee Hailey, Lucien Wilbanks, Harry Rex Vonner, Tonya Hailey, James Willard, Billy Ray Cobb, Ellen Roark, Ozzie Walls, Judge Omar Noose, Rufus Buckley, Ethel Twitty, Freddy Cobb, Stump Sisson, Mickey Mouse (A Time to Kill), Ollie Agee, Mack Loyd Crowell, Bo Marsharfsky, Dr. W.T.
