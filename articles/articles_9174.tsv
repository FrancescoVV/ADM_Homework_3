The First Chronicles of Druss the Legend	The Drenai Saga #6	David Gemmell	4.34	10448	200	He was known as Druss. The Deathwalker. Though the blood of merciless butchers coursed through his veins, he had found a fragile peace through his love for beautiful, mystical Rowena. Then came the day when Druss returned to their village and found everyone dead--massacred by slavers who had stolen the women to sell for gold. Rowena was among the missing. Armed with only his powerful double-bladed ax, Snaga, Druss went after Rowena. His journey would carry him from the highest thrones of power to the deepest dungeons of depravity. Along the way, he would battle savage monsters and descend into terrifying lands of black magic and demons. Yet one thing was certain. Druss would have victory . . . or death.	334	1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/526071.The_First_Chronicles_of_Druss_the_Legend
