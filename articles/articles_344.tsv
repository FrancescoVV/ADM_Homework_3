If I Stay	If I Stay #1	Gayle Forman	3.94	715343	38477	Just listen, Adam says with a voice that sounds like shrapnel. I open my eyes wide now. I sit up as much as I can. And I listen. Stay, he says. Choices. Seventeen-year-old Mia is faced with some tough ones: Stay true to her first love—music—even if it means losing her boyfriend and leaving her family and friends behind? Then one February morning Mia goes for a drive with her family, and in an instant, everything changes. Suddenly, all the choices are gone, except one. And it's the only one that matters. If I Stay is a heartachingly beautiful book about the power of love, the true meaning of family, and the choices we all make.	201	April 2nd 2009	Teddy Hall, Kim Schein, Adam Wilde, Mia Hall	United States of America, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4374400-if-i-stay
