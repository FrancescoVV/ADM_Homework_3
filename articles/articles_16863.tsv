Tempest's Legacy	Jane True #3	Nicole Peeler	4.06	4780	281	After a peaceful hiatus at home in Rockabill, Jane True thinks that her worst problem is that she still throws like a girl -- at least while throwing fireballs. Her peace of mind ends, however, when Anyan arrives one night with terrible news . . . news that will rock Jane's world to its very core. After demanding to help investigate a series of gruesome attacks on females -- supernatural, halfling, and human -- Jane quickly finds herself forced to confront her darkest nightmares as well as her deepest desires. And she's not sure which she finds more frightening.	344	December 28th 2010		Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8434922-tempest-s-legacy
