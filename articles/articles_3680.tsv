The Crippled God	Malazan Book of the Fallen #10	Steven Erikson	4.48	23116	1030	The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore. This woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, will challenge the gods - if her own mutinous troops don't kill her first. Her enemy, the Forkrul Assail, seek to cleanse the world, to annihilate everything. In the realm of Kurald Galain, home to the long lost city of Kharkanas, a refugees commanded by Yedan Derryg, the Watch, await the breaching of Lightfall, and the coming of the Tiste Liosan. In this war they cannot win, they will die in the name of an empty city and a queen with no subjects. Elsewhere, the three Elder Gods, Kilmandaros, Errastas and Sechul Lath, work to shatter the chains binding Korabas, the Otataral Dragon. Against her force of utter devastation, no mortal can stand. At the Gates of Starvald Demelain, the Azath House sealing the portal is dying. Soon will come the Eleint, dragons, and a final cataclysm.	921	February 15th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8447255-the-crippled-god
