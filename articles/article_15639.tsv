Years ago, she and Sam Logan shared an incredible bond built on passion, legend, and fate.

The new owner of the island's only hotel, Sam has returned to Three Sisters with hopes of winning back Mia's affections. He is puzzled when she greets him with icy indifference—for the chemistry between them is still sizzling and true. Angry, hurt and deeply confused, Mia refuses to admit that a passion for Sam still burns in her heart. But she'll need his help—and his powers—to face her greatest, most terrifying challenge. And as the deadline for breaking a centuries-old curse draws near, they must take the first steps toward destiny—and come together to turn back the dark....	358	May 1st 2002	Mia Devlin, Sam Logan	United States of America, Three Sisters Island (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59822.Face_the_Fire
