When I died two months ago, my killer told my twin sister to become me - or else. Now Emma has it down to a T. She tosses her hair with the signature Sutton Mercer flip and can lead a Lying Game prank with the best of them. She's even repairing my relationship with my adoptive family. The only thing she hasn't done is solve my murder. Then our birth mother, the woman who abandoned us, showed up in Tucson.
