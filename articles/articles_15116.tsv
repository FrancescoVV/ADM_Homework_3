Speechless		Hannah Harrington	3.97	11151	1412	Everyone knows that Chelsea Knot can't keep a secret Until now. Because the last secret she shared turned her into a social outcast—and nearly got someone killed. Now Chelsea has taken a vow of silence—to learn to keep her mouth shut, and to stop hurting anyone else. And if she thinks keeping secrets is hard, not speaking up when she's ignored, ridiculed and even attacked is worse. But there's strength in silence, and in the new friends who are, shockingly, coming her way—people she never noticed before; a boy she might even fall for. If only her new friends can forgive what she's done. If only she can forgive herself.	288	August 28th 2012	Asha, Sam Turner, Chelsea Knot, Kristen Courteau, Noah Beckett		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13069681-speechless
