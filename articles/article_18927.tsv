Spill Zone	Spill Zone #1	Scott Westerfeld, Alex Puvilland, Hilary Sycamore	4.02	4913	1130	Nobody's ever really explained the Spill. Was it an angelic visitation? A nanotech accident? A porthole opening from another world? Whatever it was, no one's allowed in the Spill Zone these days except government scientists and hazmat teams. But a few intrepid explorers know how to sneak through the patrols and steer clear of the dangers inside the Zone. Addison Merrick is one such explorer, dedicated to finding out what happened that night and to unraveling the events that took her parents and left her little sister mute and disconnected from the world.	224	May 2nd 2017	Addison Merritt, Lexa Merritt, Tan'ea Vandersloot, Wiley, Don Jae, Marty	Poughkeepsie, New York (United States), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23532871-spill-zone
