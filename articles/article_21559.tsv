Killing the Story	Isabel Long Mystery  #4	Joan Livingston	4.52	52	11	An accidental death that was no accident… For the record, Estelle Crane, the gutsy editor of The Observer newspaper, died after a hard fall on ice. But years later, her son discovers a cryptic note hinting her death might not have been an accident after all. Was Estelle pursuing a big story that put her life in danger? That’s what Isabel Long — along with her 93-year-old mother, Maria, her ‘Watson’ — agrees to investigate in Dillard, a town whose best days are in the past. A former journalist, Isabel follows leads and interviews sources, new and familiar. She quickly finds a formidable threat in Police Chief James Hawthorne, who makes it clear Isabel is not welcome in his town — and who warns her against poking her nose into Estelle’s death. Of course, that’s after Isabel has discovered the chief’s questionable policing and a troubled history with Estelle that goes way back. Killing the story means dropping it because there aren’t enough facts to back it up. But Isabel won’t make that mistake. She’ll see this one through to the very end. Can she uncover the plot that led to Estelle’s murder?	221	August 26th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54326092-killing-the-story
