Allison's Secret	Allison's Secret #1	D. Stalter	4.26	693	102	Allison has a secret. Like any farm wife, she is prepared for bad storms, bad times, and bad luck. But, even her husband is unaware that she is more prepared than the average farm wife. (But don't ever call Allison a prepper!) Riley and Will are motorcycle buddies on a mission to rescue Riley's nephew who's been kidnapped by his father. When a solar flare throws them all together, there's going to be problems. Allison's Secret offers a different approach to the post apocalyptic fiction genre. Follow a woman who has a will to survive as she works to build a community that offers hope for a new future.	304	June 30th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40689984-allison-s-secret
