Sins & Shadows	Shadows Inquiries #1	Lyn Benedict	3.36	1060	101	Sylvie Lightner is no ordinary P.I. She specializes in cases involving the unusual, in a world where magic is real-and where death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. But when an employee is murdered in front of her, Sylvie has had enough. After years of confounding the dark forces of the Magicus Mundi, she's closing up shop-until a man claiming to be the God of Justice wants Sylvie to find his lost lover. And he won't take no for an answer.	357	March 9th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6091497-sins-shadows
