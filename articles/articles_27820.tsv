The Larks: Wars are fought by ordinary people		Jem Shaw, Martin Shaw	4.13	40	3	Andy Palmer is a few days shy of his eighteenth birthday when he joins his squadron in Northern France. It is June 1916 and the great slaughter of the Somme approaches. In the desperate humour and visceral fear of the weeks that follow we see the effect of daily madness on ordinary, civilised people. With a strong eye for accuracy, "The Larks" is moving, often lewdly funny and occasionally shockingly brutal.	392	January 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19083248-the-larks
