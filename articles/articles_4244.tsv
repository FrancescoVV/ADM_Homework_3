Belonging	Temptation #2	Karen Ann Hopkins	3.95	942	168	I left everything I knew behind. But it was worth it. He was worth it. No one thought an ordinary girl like me would last two minutes living with the Amish, not even me. There are a lot more rules and a lot less freedom, and I miss my family and the life I once had. Worst of all, Noah and I aren't even allowed to see each other. Not until I've proven myself. If I can find a way to make it work, we'll be NOAH & ROSE together forever. But not everybody believes this is where I belong.	408	January 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15774969-belonging
