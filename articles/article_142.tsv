Watchmen	Watchmen #1-12	Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John    Higgins	4.36	488504	14229	This Hugo Award-winning graphic novel chronicles the fall from grace of a group of super-heroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the super-hero is dissected as the heroes are stalked by an unknown assassin. One of the most influential graphic novels of all time and a perennial best-seller, Watchmen has been studied on college campuses across the nation and is considered a gateway title, leading readers to other graphic novels such as V for Vendetta , Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and The Sandman series.	416	September 8th 1987	Dr. Manhattan, Rorschach, Hollis Mason, Daniel Dreiberg, Sally Jupiter, Laurel Jupiter, Adrian Veidt, Edward Blake	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen
