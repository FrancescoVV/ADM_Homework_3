King of Rome		Dave Sudbury, Hans Saefkow	3.56	9	3	In the early 20th century, a man named Charlie Hudson raised racing pigeons in Derby, England. In 1913, he entered his best bird in a race all the way from Rome. A devastating storm came through on the day of the race and all the pigeons disappeared — all but Charlie Hudson’s pigeon, which found international acclaim as the "King of Rome.” This lovely picture book follows the true story of Charlie and his amazing pigeon, and the hope they brought to his working class world. Gorgeous pencil and crayon illustrations capture both the era and the sense of flight.	28	June 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3388877-king-of-rome
