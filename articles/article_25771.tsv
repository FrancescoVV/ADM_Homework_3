The Riders of Thunder Realm	Paladero #1	Steven Lochran	4.04	79	23	The Knights of Thunder Realm is the first in an epic fantasy series about hope, betrayal, and trying to make a better life for yourself when you’ve come from nothing. It’s also about dinosaurs, which is awesome. Welcome to Thunder Realm, where cowboy-knights known as paladeros herd dinosaurs during peacetime, and take up arms during war. Joss, a young orphan, has always wanted to be a paladero – but first he must prove himself by going on The Way, a treacherous journey through the kingdom to retrieve a rare Questing Egg. With his trusty raptor Azof by his side, Joss will face off against witches, bloodthirsty monsters and even his own brethren to learn what it truly means to be a paladero – all while uncovering a dark conspiracy at the heart of the kingdom.	320	July 1st 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28052452-the-riders-of-thunder-realm
