Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary	Landmarks of World Literature	Stephen Heath, J.P. Stern	3.66	91	4	This novel achieved immediate notoriety through its questioning of marriage, sex and the role of women. Stephen Heath shows how this landmark text captures and articulates a fundamental experience of the postromantic, commerical-industrial, democratic period. He explains how Madame Bovary represents Flaubert's intense personal engagement with the tragedy of bourgeois culture, while at the same time exemplifying the author's commitment to the impersonality of art and the transcendence of style.	180	April 24th 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129956.Gustave_Flaubert_Madame_Bovary
