Word of Honor	Gamadin #1	Tom Kirkbride	3.43	40	6	Sixteen-year olds Harlowe Pylott and Matt Riverstone are bodysurfing the gnarliest waves of the new century when their fun is interrupted by a yacht capsizing off the Newport coast. After rescuing the famous movie star Simon Bolt and the half-alien socialite Leucadia Mars from certain death, Fate sends them on the greatest ride of their lives. Robobs and the undog are only the beginning Dakadude killers have swooped down from the heavens looking for the galaxy's most powerful weapon: an ancient Gamadin spaceship named Millawanda. If the Daks cannot capture Millawanda, they will kill her while she is still weak and unprotected . . . along with the Earth and anyone else who gets in their way.	446	October 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4443540-word-of-honor
