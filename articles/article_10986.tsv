The Chequer Board		Nevil Shute	4.05	1058	95	John Turner, a young man with a checkered past, has been told he has just one year to live. He decides to use his remaining time in search of three very different men he met in the hospital during the war, each of them in trouble of some kind: a pilot whose wife had betrayed him, a young corporal charged with killing a civilian in a brawl, and a black G.I. wrongly accused of the attempted rape of a white English girl. As Turner discovers where these men have landed on the checkerboard of life, he learns about compassion, tolerance, and second chances, and overcomes his fear of death.	328	1947	John Turner, Phillip Morgan, Dave Lesurier, Douglas Brent	Myanmar, Penzance, England (United Kingdom), Trenarth, Cornwall, England (United Kingdom), Trenarth, Cornwall, England , 1946 (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181972.The_Chequer_Board
