Vengeful	Villains  #2	V.E. Schwab	4.23	36988	6178	The sequel to VICIOUS, V.E. Schwab's first adult novel. Sydney once had Serena—beloved sister, betrayed enemy, powerful ally. But now she is alone, except for her thrice-dead dog, Dol, and then there's Victor, who thinks Sydney doesn't know about his most recent act of vengeance. Victor himself is under the radar these days—being buried and re-animated can strike concern even if one has superhuman powers. But despite his own worries, his anger remains. And Eli Ever still has yet to pay for the evil he has done.	462	September 25th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26856502-vengeful
