Exercises in Style		Raymond Queneau, Barbara Wright	4.08	8606	666	The plot of Exercises in Style is quite simple: a man gets into an argument with another passenger on a bus. However, this anecdote is told ninety-nine more times, each in a radically different style, as a sonnet, an opera, in slang, and with many more permutations. This virtuoso set of variations is a linguistic rust-remover, and a guide to literary forms.	204	April 28th 1947		Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319790.Exercises_in_Style
