The Wide Game	Harmony, Indiana #1	Michael  West	3.88	201	32	On the advice of his wife, Paul Rice is making plans to attend his 10th year High School reunion. Returning to his boyhood home of Harmony, Indiana, he finds that he is still haunted by memories of that timeâ€“memories of Deidra, his first love, and memories of the Wide Game. It was ten years ago that Paul and his friends watched their day of fun become a race for their lives, a fight for their very souls. Now, as he meets the survivors of that day once more, Paul makes a chilling discovery: the incomprehensible forces that toyed with them have yet to finish playing their own game.	317	June 23rd 2003	Danny Fields, Robby Miller, Shelly Wells, Delbert King, Paul Rice, Father Andrew Chapman, Deidra Perkins, Nancy Collins, Mick Slatton, Sean Roche, Mondamin, Cindi Hawkins	Harmony, Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18160656-the-wide-game
