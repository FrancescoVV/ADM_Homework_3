Forest Born	The Books of Bayern #4	Shannon Hale	4.03	24849	2275	Rin, Razo's little sister, is haunted by the Forest she has always loved. When Razo invites her back to the city to be one of Queen Ani's waiting women, she happily accepts...only to end up on the adventure of her lifetime, following the queen, Enna, and Dasha into the countryside in search of a fire-starting enemy that no one can see. As she learns more about the three women's magical talents, she finds her own strength comes from places both expected--trees--and unexpected--the sound of her own voice. A brilliant addition to the Books of Bayern, this book is a treat for fans of this series, and stands alone for readers who might be discovering the joys of Shannon Hale's writing for the first time.	389	September 1st 2009	Razo, Geric, Enna, Princess Anidori-Kiladra, Finn, Selia, Rin, Dasha		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6407514-forest-born
