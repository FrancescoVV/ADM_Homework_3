More Than Water	More Than Water #1	Renee Ericson	4.04	3757	435	It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel wrong. It just...feels. EJ Cunning, an art history major, dates musicians. Foster Blake, a chemical engineering major, can’t sing a tune. They’re not each other’s type. They’re coworkers. Then, one night leads to sex—sex between friends—which leads to an agreement. It all seems so simple—but nothing ever is. Many layers build a person’s facade. Look into the depths for what’s hidden within. It’s more than water. It’s a story—a living and breathing substance beyond the reflective surface.	340	June 22nd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18188390-more-than-water
