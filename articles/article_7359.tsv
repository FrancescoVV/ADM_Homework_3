The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again)		Andy Warhol	3.77	37428	490	A loosely formed autobiography by Andy Warhol, told with his trademark blend of irony and detachment In The Philosophy of Andy Warhol —which, with the subtitle "(From A to B and Back Again)," is less a memoir than a collection of riffs and reflections—he talks about love, sex, food, beauty, fame, work, money, and success; about New York, America, and his childhood in McKeesport, Pennsylvania; about his good times and bad in New York, the explosion of his career in the sixties, and his life among celebrities.	272	1975			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31818.The_Philosophy_of_Andy_Warhol
