Sugar and Spice	L.A. Candy #3	Lauren Conrad	3.53	12740	604	In the final book of the hit series L.A. Candy, Jane Roberts is a bona fide celebrity—she’s got the VIP treatment, couture clothes, and starlet looks. She also has the tabloid scandals, fake friends, and relentless paparazzi. Having learned a few things from her first season on the air, Jane is trying to surround herself with the people who she knows love her for her...and take a break from boys—since they’ve been nothing but trouble. But when her high school sweetheart Caleb and her unrequited L.A. crush Braden show up, both looking cuter and acting sweeter than ever, Jane has a hard time remembering her no-boys rule.... Just when everything feels out of control, Jane makes a shocking discovery. And what she finds changes everyone’s definition of “reality” forever. In her deliciously entertaining novel, television star Lauren Conrad pulls the curtain back on young Hollywood and shows that sometimes the real drama is behind the scenes.	288	January 1st 2010		Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7707538-sugar-and-spice
