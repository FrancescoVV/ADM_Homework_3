Revolutionary Road		Richard Yates	3.90	80101	6730	In the hopeful 1950s, Frank and April Wheeler appear to be a model American couple: bright, beautiful, talented, with two young children and a starter home in the suburbs. Perhaps they married too young and started a family too early. Maybe Frank's job is dull. And April never saw herself as a housewife. Yet they have always lived on the assumption that greatness is only just around the corner. But now that certainty is now about to crumble. With heartbreaking compassion and remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their spiritual birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves.	355	December 31st 1961	Frank Wheeler, April Wheeler, Shep Campbell, Milly Campbell	Connecticut (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48328.Revolutionary_Road
