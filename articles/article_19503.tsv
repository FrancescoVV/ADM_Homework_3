Contagion	Contagion #1	Erin Bowman	3.88	3942	913	It got in us After receiving an urgent SOS from a work detail on a distant planet, a skeleton crew is dispatched to perform a standard search-and-rescue mission. Most are dead. But when the crew arrives, they find an abandoned site, littered with rotten food, discarded weapons...and dead bodies. Don't set foot here again. As they try to piece together who—or what—could have decimated an entire operation, they discover that some things are best left buried—and some monsters are only too ready to awaken.	432	July 24th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068650-contagion
