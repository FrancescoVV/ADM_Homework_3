Sam's Creed	Hell's Eight #2	Sarah McCarty	4.04	2887	180	Known for making up his own rules of right and wrong, Texas Ranger Sam "Wildcard" MacGregor takes what he wants when he wants it, especially when it comes to women. But seduction is the last thing on his mind when he stumbles across a beauty crouching in fear beside a burned-out wagon. Isabella may look feminine and unassuming, but she's hell in a bodice with gunslinging skills to match any man's. The woman the townsfolk call "cursed" is hiding secrets too dangerous to face alone. Luckily, she sees in Sam what he can barely glimpse in himself--a virtuous man in a hard country bent on breaking him. A man who, under it all, craves a passionate woman willing to risk everything....	423	2008	Sam MacGregor, Isabella Montoya	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2798263-sam-s-creed
