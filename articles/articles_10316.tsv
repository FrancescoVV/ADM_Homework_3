Rough, Raw, and Ready	Rough Riders #5	Lorelei James	4.21	11578	522	Torn between the love he has and the love he s always wanted. Rough Riders Series, Book 5 Chassie West Glanzer hasn't been a stranger to drama and tragedy. A year of wedded bliss to sexy-as-sin cowboy Trevor Glanzer has brought her the happiness and contentment she never thought she d find, and mellowed Trevor's rodeo wanderlust. Then Trevor's old roping partner ambles up the driveway and Chassie's life changes drastically. Trevor never expected to see Edgard Mancuso again, after it became clear he couldn't be the man Edgard needed. Now Edgard is back from Brazil to sort out their tangled past, and Trevor is plagued with feelings he thought he d buried over three years ago. Although Trevor is hat-over-bootheels in love with his sweet, feisty wife, the sense his life is missing a piece has always gnawed at him. Chassie's shock that Edgard and Trevor were once lovers turns to fear of losing her husband. Or worse, fear that Trevor will stay with her only out of a sense of duty. Yet as the three of them spend time together, the sins of the past blur and fade, leaving raw emotion and unbridled passion. Passion that could heal or cause irreparable damage to their future."	340	November 4th 2008	Chassie West Glanzer, Trevor Glanzer, Edgard Mancuso, Colt McKay, Jessie McKay, Brandt McKay	Sundance, Wyoming (United States), Wyoming (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27809980-rough-raw-and-ready
