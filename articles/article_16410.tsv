The Oasis	Lords of the Two Lands #2	Pauline Gedge	4.11	762	36	After his father's death, Kamose assumes command of the rebellion of the native princes against their overlords. He makes a perilous sweep up the river Nile toward the delta strongholds of the Hyksos. The costs are heavy in terms of men slain and villages destroyed. The long domination of alien men and their gods has been effectively challenged, but Kamose cannot lead the Egyptians to glory.	544	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296567.The_Oasis
