Tunnel in the Sky (Heinlein's Juveniles, #9)		Robert A. Heinlein	3.94	12106	503	A classic novel from the mind of the storyteller who captures the imagination of readers from around the world, and across two generations. The final exam for Dr. Matson's Advanced Survival class was meant to be just that: only a test. But something has gone terribly wrong...and now Rod Walker and his fellow students are stranded somewhere unknown in the universe, beyond contact with Earth, at the other end of a tunnel in the sky. Stripped of all comforts, hoping for a passage home that may never appear, the castaways must band together or perish. For Rod and his fellow survivors, this is one test where failure is not an option....	262	January 1st 1955			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16683.Tunnel_in_the_Sky
