The Tale of the Body Thief	The Vampire Chronicles #4	Anne Rice	3.73	79841	1430	In a gripping feat of storytelling, Anne Rice continues the extraordinary Vampire Chronicles that began with the now-classic Interview with the Vampire . For centuries, Lestat—vampire-hero, enchanter, seducer of mortals—has been a courted prince in the dark and flourishing universe of the living dead. Now he is alone. And in his overwhelming need to destroy his doubts and his loneliness, Lestat embarks on the most dangerous enterprise he has undertaken in all the years of his haunted existence. Praise for The Tale of the Body Thief “Tinged with mystery, full of drama . . . The story is involving, the twists surprising.” — People “Rice is our modern messenger of the occult, whose nicely updated dark-side passion plays twist and turn in true Gothic form.” — San Francisco Chronicle “Fast-paced . . . . mesmerizing . . . silkenly sensuous . . . No one writing today matches her deftness with the erotic.” — The Atlanta Journal-Constitution “Hypnotic . . . masterful.” — Cosmopolitan From the Paperback edition.	468	October 4th 1992	Lestat de Lioncourt, David Talbot		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31336.The_Tale_of_the_Body_Thief
