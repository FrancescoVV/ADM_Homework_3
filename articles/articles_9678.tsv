The first three books are now available as a collectible paperback boxed set! Sophie Foster has never quite fit into her life. The reason? Sophie's a Telepath, someone who can read minds. No one knows her secret--at least, that's what she thinks. It turns out the reason Sophie has never felt at home is that, well, she ... isn't. And as she sets out for a new life that is vastly different from what she has ever known, telepathy is just the first of many shocking secrets that will be revealed. This complete boxed set collection of the Keeper of the Lost Cities series includes Keeper of the Lost Cities , Exile , and Everblaze .	1744	August 25th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24885561-keeper-of-the-lost-cities-exile-everblaze
