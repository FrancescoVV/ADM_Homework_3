The Caliphate of Banu Ummaiya		ابن كثير, Ibn Kathir	4.58	31	0	Darussalam is proud to present the abridged English translation of the classic work: Al-Bidayah Wan Nihayah. This book focuses on the tenure that took place after the wonderful time of “Khulfa-e-Rashidan” (the four caliphs) which took out the Arabian Peninsula from the darkness of associating ilahs (gods) with Almighty Allah swt. This book discusses the tenure and the reign time of Banu Umaiyyah starting from 40th Hijri to 132nd Hijri year. In this book the author Ibn e Kathir explains the biography of the caliphs, the merits of their ruling times, major and minor events that took place during their reign, the year by year happenings and the transition of the government bodies known as Caliphs. All of the narrations and references are very much authentic as this phase of Islamic history is very much manipulated and distorted by historians of Islam. As Al-Bidayah Wan Nihayah (The Beginning and The End), by the renowned and famous scholar Abu Al-Fida Imad ad-Deen Isma’eel bin Umar ibn Katheer, is considered as one of the most authoritative sources on Islamic History	560	December 15th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18785785-the-caliphate-of-banu-ummaiya
