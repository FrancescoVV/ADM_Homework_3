Cry in the Night	Rock Harbor #5	Colleen Coble	4.21	2345	161	The highly anticipated novel that delivers what romantic suspense fans have waited for — the return to Rock Harbor. A mysterious crying in the night leads search-and-rescue worker Bree Matthews and her dog Samson to an abandoned baby in the woods outside of Rock Harbor, Michigan. Against objections from her husband, Bree takes the baby girl in. Quickly she begins a search for the mother—presumably the woman reported missing just days earlier. While teams scour the wintery forests, Bree ferrets out clues about the woman. Where is she and why did she leave the child behind? And how does that connect to Bree's first husband's mysterious death years ago in the Upper Peninsula? Everything Bree thought she knew about her life is turned upside down with the sound of a Cry in the Night .	304	February 3rd 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15869691-cry-in-the-night
