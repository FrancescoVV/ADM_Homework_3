Cinnamon Bizarre : Collection of Short Stories		Nishta Kochar	4.86	7	2	Cinnamon Bizarre is a fun and quirky collection of nine short stories that will take you on a spectacular journey across genres and timelines. The stories range from whacky, odd humor to stranger, darker things. From the tickling account of a nearly cuckoo screenwriter’s quest for inspiration and his most eccentric muses to the amusing tale of an odd friendship spun over a curious case of some missing buttons; from the hilarious journery of a multi-millionaire diamond merchant’s wife who finds herself in a pickle to the haunting story of the mysterious Achaari Begum, the sinister Pickle Queen – Cinnamon Bizarre is a handful of tickles, amazement, shock and entertainment, all at once. This is a book for everyone with an appetite for lighthearted fun and hilarity. If you relish the funny, the quirky and the bizarre, then this book will take you on a hysterical joyride. The straight, the gay, the old, the young, men, women – all are welcome!	242	October 1st 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42852820-cinnamon-bizarre
