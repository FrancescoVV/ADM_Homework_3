The Songs of Distant Earth		Arthur C. Clarke	3.91	13559	605	Just a few islands in a planetwide ocean, Thalassa was a veritable paradiseâ€”home to one of the small colonies founded centuries before by robot Mother Ships when the Sun had gone nova and mankind had fled Earth. Mesmerized by the beauty of Thalassa and overwhelmed by its vast resources, the colonists lived an idyllic existence, unaware of the monumental evolutionary event slowly taking place beneath their seas... Then the Magellan arrived in orbit carrying one million refugees from the last, mad days on Earth. And suddenly uncertainty and change had come to the placid paradise that was Thalassa.	256	1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117842.The_Songs_of_Distant_Earth
