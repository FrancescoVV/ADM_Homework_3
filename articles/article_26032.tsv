Tam Lin: A Modern, Queer Retelling		T.J. Deschamps	4.63	8	6	Over five hundred years ago, Tam Lin betrayed the Queen of the Fae, leaving her to be with his human lover Janet. Tom, a literature professor, knew the story. Adopted, he spent his life studying the stories of others and their families, never knowing his own. When his boyfriend, Ariel, gifted Tom an all expense paid trip to Ireland to seek out his Ulster-Scots roots, he never expected to find out how his story tied into the legendary Ballad of Tam Lin.	98	October 1st 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55341647-tam-lin
