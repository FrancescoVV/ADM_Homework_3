The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Tales of Terror		Robert Louis Stevenson, Robert Mighall	3.96	106992	1201	"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" Stevenson's famous exploration of humanity's basest capacity for evil, has become synonymous with the idea of a split personality. More than a moral tale, this dark psychological fantasy is also a product of its time, drawing on contemporary theories of class, evolution, criminality, and secret lives. Also in this volume are "The Body Snatcher," which charts the murky underside of Victorian medical practice, and "Olalla," a tale of vampirism and "The Beast Within" which features a beautiful woman at its center. This new edition features a critical introduction, chronology, suggestions for further reading, explanatory notes, and appendixes, including an abridged extract from "A Chapter on Dreams" and an essay on the scientific context of Jekyll and Hyde.	224	January 5th 1886	Dr. Henry Jekyll, Mr Edward Hyde	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51497.The_Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde_and_Other_Tales_of_Terror
