Perhaps you have been abused, left alone, and filled with anger, fear, and hatred. In this book, you will find the story of a young girl named Layla.

This page-turner is one that will leave you encouraged and determined to fight through your struggles, and trust God with every area of your life. No matter how dark and hazy it may seem, God’s light will shine bright- right through it all!
