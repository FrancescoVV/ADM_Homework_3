Then their secrets begin to unravel. Their union brings hope and promise to her family's secret society, the Angels' army, and to the future of mankind.

After all, Alexis and Tristan are a match made in Heaven and in Hell.	377	December 6th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9539767-purpose
