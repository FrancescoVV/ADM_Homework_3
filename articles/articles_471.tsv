To the Lighthouse		Virginia Woolf	3.78	134241	7564	The serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay, and their children and assorted guests are on holiday on the Isle of Skye. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and the conflict between men and women. As time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and simultaneously, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumphâ€”the human capacity for change.	209	1927	James Ramsay, Mrs. Ramsay, Mr. Ramsay, Lily Briscoe, Paul Rayley, Minta Doyle, Charles Tansley, William Bankes, Augustus Carmichael, Andrew Ramsay, Jasper Ramsay, Roger Ramsay, Prue Ramsay, Rose Ramsay, Nancy Ramsay, Cam Ramsay, Mrs. McNab	Isle of Skye, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59716.To_the_Lighthouse
