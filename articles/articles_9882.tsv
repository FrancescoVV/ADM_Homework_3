Whose Body?	Lord Peter Wimsey #1	Dorothy L. Sayers	3.88	44996	2669	The stark naked body was lying in the tub. Not unusual for a proper bath, but highly irregular for murder -- especially with a pair of gold pince-nez deliberately perched before the sightless eyes. What's more, the face appeared to have been shaved after death. The police assumed that the victim was a prominent financier, but Lord Peter Wimsey, who dabbled in mystery detection as a hobby, knew better. In this, his first murder case, Lord Peter untangles the ghastly mystery of the corpse in the bath.	212	1923	Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey, Mervyn Bunter, The Honorable Freddy Arbuthnot, Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Sir Reuben Levy, Rachel Levy, Sir Julian Freke, Inspector Sugg, Honoria Lucasta, Dowager Duchess of Denver	London, England (United Kingdom), Salisbury, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192893.Whose_Body_
