Six Months Later		Natalie D. Richards	3.79	8004	1085	She has everything she's ever wanted. But not her memory... When Chloe fell asleep in study hall, it was the middle of May. When she wakes up, snow is on the ground and she can't remember the last six months of her life. Before, she'd been a mediocre student. Now, she's on track for valedictorian and being recruited by Ivy League schools. Before, she never had a chance with super jock Blake. Now he's her boyfriend. Before, she and Maggie were inseparable. Now her best friend won't speak to her. What happened to her? Remembering the truth could be more dangerous than she knows...	323	October 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54434347-six-months-later
