And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friendsâ€”one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena - Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.	375	June 28th 2005	Annabeth Chase, Grover Underwood, Luke Castellan, Zeus (God), Dionysus (mythology), Ares (god), Hades, Poseidon (God), Chiron, Percy Jackson	New York City, New York (United States), Montauk, New York (United States), New Jersey (United States), St. Louis, Missouri (United States) Las Vegas, Nevada (United States) Long Island, New York (United States), St. Louis, Missouri (United States), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States), Long Island, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28187.The_Lightning_Thief
