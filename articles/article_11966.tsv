A Christmas Memory		Truman Capote	4.24	11420	1108	First published in 1956, this much sought-after autobiographical recollection of Truman Capote's rural Alabama boyhood has become a modern-day classic. We are proud to be reprinting this warm and delicately illustrated edition of A Christmas Memory --"a tiny gem of a holiday story" ( School Library Journal , starred review). Seven-year-old Buddy inaugurates the Christmas season by crying out to his cousin, Miss Sook Falk: "It's fruitcake weather!" Thus begins an unforgettable portrait of an odd but enduring friendship between two innocent souls--one young and one old--and the memories they share of beloved holiday rituals.	48	1956	Truman Capote, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, Queenie	Monroeville, Alabama (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9919.A_Christmas_Memory
