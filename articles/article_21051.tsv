Billionaire Romance: Music in His Heart		Amerine Graham	3.50	4	2	What do you do when an attractive woman tries to pick you up at a bar? For Christian the answer is simple – you let her. Sam is tipsy but quite aware of her attraction to this stranger. Neither of them cared to ask each other’s names until the next hangover morning when it turns out that they have unleashed a disaster upon themselves. Sam is an award-winning composer, who has been turning down Christian’s company’s deals for years, while for Christian this deal would mean some serious bragging rights among his family. The problem is that Sam has not written a line since the goddamn award three years ago. She fears she is one of those stars that sparkles for but one moment and are never seen again. She cannot let anyone know about her inability to compose. Not even Christian?		July 2nd 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31361931-billionaire-romance
