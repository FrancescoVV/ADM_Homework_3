For Reasons Unknown	DCI Matilda Darke #1	Michael    Wood	4.18	2308	241	Two murders. Twenty years. Now the killer is back for more… DCI Matilda Darke has returned to work after a nine month absence. A shadow of her former self, she is tasked with re-opening a cold case: the terrifyingly brutal murders of Miranda and Stefan Harkness. The only witness was their eleven-year-old son, Jonathan, who was too deeply traumatized to speak a word. Then a dead body is discovered, and the investigation leads back to Matilda's case. Suddenly the past and present converge, and it seems a killer may have come back for more… A darkly compelling debut crime novel. The start of a brilliant series, perfect for fans of Stuart MacBride, Val McDermid, and James Oswald.	244	October 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26619069-for-reasons-unknown
