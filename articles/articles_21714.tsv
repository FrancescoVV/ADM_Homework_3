The Science of Liberty: Democracy, Reason and the Laws of Nature		Timothy Ferris	3.94	472	97	“Ferris is a master analogist who conveys his insights on the history of cosmology with a lyrical flair.” — The New York Times Book Review In The Science of Liberty , award-winning author Timothy Ferris—called “the best popular science writer in the English language today” by the Christian Science Monitor and “the best science writer of his generation” by the Washington Post —makes a passionate case for science as the inspiration behind the rise of liberalism and democracy. In the grand tradition of such luminaries of the field as Bill Bryson, Richard Dawkins, and Oliver Sacks—as well as his own The Whole Shebang and Coming of Age in the Milky Way —Ferris has written a brilliant chronicle of how science sparked the spread of liberal democracy and transformed today’s world.	384	January 21st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6668774-the-science-of-liberty
