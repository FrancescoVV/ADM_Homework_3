A Perfect Husband	Sami Saxton #1	Douglas Wickard	4.11	226	56	An abandoned cabin… a diabolical killer…a hidden cemetery… a deadly secret is about to be uncovered. Far from the neon blur of Manhattan – the dizzy buzz of restaurants, theater openings and one too many cocktails – located seventy-two miles outside the City in the sleepy, rural township of Montague, New Jersey, Sami Saxton is looking to rebuild her life. A rebirth, one might call it. And, she intends to do this spiritual resurrection in a small, abandoned fishing cabin, built over forty years ago by her deceased father. Not quite abandoned… A lethal serial killer has taken up residence in the basement of Sami’s remote cottage, using her father’s carpenter table for a hobby much more sinister than woodcutting. Sequestered deep within forty-two acres of tall pine trees, bristling brooks and fresh water lakes, Sami Saxton is about to fight for her life. The hard truth… nobody will ever hear her scream !	172	January 24th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20635491-a-perfect-husband
