The Best Bad Luck I Ever Had		Kristin Levine	4.12	2977	547	The last thing Harry "Dit" Sims expects when Emma Walker comes to town is to become friends. Proper -talking, brainy Emma doesn't play baseball or fish too well, but she sure makes Dit think, especially about the differences between black and white. But soon Dit is thinking about a whole lot more when the town barber, who is black, is put on trial for a terrible crime. Together Dit and Emma come up with a daring plan to save him from the unthinkable. Set in 1917 and inspired by the author's true family history, this is the poignant story of a remarkable friendship and the perils of small-town justice.	272	January 9th 2009	Emma, Harry "Dit" Sims		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4570908-the-best-bad-luck-i-ever-had
