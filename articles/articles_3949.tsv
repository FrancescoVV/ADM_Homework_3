Beneath the Wheel		Hermann Hesse, Michael E. Roloff	3.85	13614	635	In Hermann Hesse's Beneath the Wheel or The Prodigy , Hans Giebenrath lives among the dull and respectable townsfolk of a sleepy Black Forest village. When he is discovered to be an exceptionally gifted student, the entire community presses him onto a path of serious scholarship. Hans dutifully follows the regimen of tireless study and endless examinations, his success rewarded only with more crushing assignments. When Hans befriends a rebellious young poet, he begins to imagine other possibilities outside the narrowly circumscribed world of the academy. Finally sent home after a nervous breakdown, Hans is revived by nature and romance, and vows never to return to the gray conformity of the academic system.	192	1906	Hans Giebernath, Joseph Giebenrath, Hermann Heilner, Emil Lucius, Otto Wenger, Karl Hamel, Otto Hartner	Germany, Maulbronn (Germany), Stuttgart (Germany), Bielach (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25905.Beneath_the_Wheel
