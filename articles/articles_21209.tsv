Ancient Music in the Pines: In Zen Mind Suddenly Stops		Osho	4.31	91	11	Of the ultimate realization of Zen, Osho says, "Suddenly you become aware of a music that has always surrounded youâ€¦ Your heart throbs in the same rhythm as the heart of the whole." This essential Zen reader also dips into a number of other themes - cowardice, boredom and restlessness, recognition and rejection, maturity, and moving from the non-essential to the essential. Time Period of Osho's original Discourses/Talks/Letters Feb 21, 1976 to Feb 29, 1976	160	1977			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11054124-ancient-music-in-the-pines
