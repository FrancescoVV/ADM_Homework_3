The Big Rock Candy Mountain		Wallace Stegner	4.16	7141	820	Bo Mason, his wife, Elsa, and their two boys live a transient life of poverty and despair. Drifting from town to town and from state to state, the violent, ruthless Bo seeks out his fortune—in the hotel business, in new farmland, and, eventually, in illegal rum-running through the treacherous back roads of the American Northwest. Stegner portrays more than thirty years in the life of the Mason family in this masterful, harrowing saga of people trying to survive during the lean years of the early twentieth century.	563	1943	Bo Mason, Elsa Mason, Chester Mason, Bruce Mason	North Dakota (United States), Saskatchewan (Canada), Salt Lake City, Utah (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10801.The_Big_Rock_Candy_Mountain
