The Island Project		Taylor Buck	3.50	44	7	The Big Island of Hawaii is a place of exotic beauty, serene landscapes and timeless culture. It is also a place filled with secretsâ€”both ancient and modern. Photographer, Tom Bennett, while scouting the island of Hawaii for an upcoming big-budget film, stumbles across a bizarre, panther-like creature in the forest. As Bennett and his adventurous wildlife biologist friend, Kelly Adler, dig deeper into the origins of the creature, they find themselves uncovering a clandestine military experiment fronted by a brilliant inventor and a psychopathic engineer spiraling out of control. The photographer and his lovely colleague are thrust into the middle of a daring investigation which finds them swimming through the Pacific, evading deadly automatons in an elaborate government facility and navigating through the dense, tropical jungle of Hawaii in order to escape the secret they uncovered.	242	June 17th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18924775-the-island-project
