Moby-Dick or, the Whale		Herman Melville, Andrew Delbanco, Tom Quirk, Rockwell Kent	3.51	480542	15745	"It is the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it." So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception. This edition of Moby-Dick , which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.	654	October 18th 1851	Elijah, Stubb, Captain Ahab, Ishmael, Queequeg, Starbuck, Tashtego, Dough-boy, Flask, Daggoo, Fedallah, Pippin ("Pip"), Moby Dick, Mapple Priest, Peleg, Bildad, Fleece, Perth, Peter Coffin, Aunt Charity, Mrs Hussey	Nantucket Island, Massachusetts (United States), Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, New Bedford, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale
