The Story of a Seagull and the Cat Who Taught Her to Fly		Luis Sep√∫lveda, Chris Sheban, Margaret Sayers Peden	4.18	17094	1394	A cat. A seagull. An impossible task. A worldwide bestseller and the subject of a feature film, THE STORY OF A SEAGULL... is finally out in paperback! Her wings burdened by an oil slick, a seagull struggles to the nearest port to lay her final egg. Exhausted, she lands on a balcony where Zorba the cat is sunning himself. She extracts three extraordinary promises from him: that he will watch over the egg, that he will not EAT the egg, and that, when it's time, he will teach the baby gull to fly. The first two promises are hard enough, but the third one is surely impossible. Isn't it?	128	October 1996	Zorba, Einstein, Segretario, Sevenseas, Lucky (The Story of a Seagull...), The Colonel, Matthew (The Story of a Seagull...), Kengah	Hamburg (Germany), Germany	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8797.The_Story_of_a_Seagull_and_the_Cat_Who_Taught_Her_to_Fly
