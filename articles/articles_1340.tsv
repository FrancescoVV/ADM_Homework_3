Big Little Lies		Liane Moriarty	4.27	752442	46022	From the author of Truly Madly Guilty and The Husband s Secret comes a novel about the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive. A murder...A tragic accident...Or just parents behaving badly? What’s indisputable is that someone is dead. Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny, biting, and passionate; she remembers everything and forgives no one. Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare but she is paying a price for the illusion of perfection. New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for a nanny. She comes with a mysterious past and a sadness beyond her years. These three women are at different crossroads, but they will all wind up in the same shocking place. Big Little Lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the little lies that can turn lethal.	460	December 25th 2014	Celeste White, Madeline Martha Mackenzie, Jane Chapman (Liane Moriarty), Perry Wright, Ed Mackenzie, Bonnie Carlson, Nathan Carlson, Renata Klein, Gordon Klein, Abigail Carlson, Detective Adrienne Quinlan, Ms. Rebecca Barnes, Tom	Sydney, New South Wales (Australia)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33516773-big-little-lies
