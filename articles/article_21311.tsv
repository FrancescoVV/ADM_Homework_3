The Daily Quest: Conquering a Sound Body, a Sane Mind, and a Soft Heart		Fox Lehjika	5.00	2	2	Life on earth is a dichotomic gamble. Either we live, or we die. If we die, the equation is solved. But if we are alive, there are two possibilities: either we are happy, or we are unhappy. If we are happy, there are little things to worry about and few questions to ask. If we are unhappy, there two possibilities: either we get to work to reverse our misfortune, or we bow to the challenge. If we give up trying, we can just sit and wait for the nature to take care of us and relegate life concerns until eventually death comes. If we are resilient and keep fighting for a better life, there are two possibilities: either we choose to be constructive, or we engage in destructive schemes. In either situation, we find ourselves faced with many questions and few or no answers. Some questions raising hope, some others striking fear and uncertainty. If we find answers, some solve our problem with no collateral damage to ourselves and to others; some other go the other way. In both cases, these answers can be like medication; curing some patients and hurting others, and sometime bringing both cure and harm at the same time! In some instances, we intend to do good, just to end up with harmful results. In some other cases, ill intentions result in something good. In all these situations, one thing remains a constant; that is, nothing is certain and there is no guarantee that the next hour will find us in physical, mental, and emotional shape to face the next challenges or seize new opportunities. The search for such certainty is elusive, which makes it a Daily Quest. On the one hand, were there a onetime answer to these concerns, a onetime price could be paid, and the problem could be settled once and for all. But, just as these life pressing questions spawn at the time we wake up and follow us for the rest of the day, they need to be answered on daily basis, and the likely answers require a sustained daily exercise involving our body, mind, and heart. The purpose of this book is not to offer answers to the many lifeâ€™s questions. Rather, this essay presents and describes the natural and powerful, but often overlooked tools the nature has afforded us and which we need in our Daily Quest. These gears are the Power of thought concentrated, the power of critical thinking, and the power of prayer. They are intrinsically related to our physical body, our mind, and our emotions. We all practice them, but not in a way to harness their tremendous transformative qualities. The author strongly believes that by systematizing the use of these tools in our daily life, we can enhance our ability to appreciate the dissonances of life and meet our challenges and opportunities with happiness and success. Therefore, this book will make sense to the reader only to the extent that s/he tries first hand the exercises here explained. Every effort is a step in a good direction. The Quest is an individual and a daily undertaking. If you can, be your own master!	170	December 14th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43374092-the-daily-quest
