No Tomorrow		Carian Cole	4.29	6860	1411	The people we love are thieves. They steal our hearts. They steal our breath. They steal our sanity. And we let them. Over and over and over again. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * They say you never forget your first love. Mine was a homeless musician who wandered straight into my soul. He was my first everything. And fourteen years later, I still can't get him out of my head. He broke all my rules. He also broke my heart. I watched him climb to stardom, cheering him on from afar. But I was never a fan; just a girl in love. Like a tornado, he spiraled, leaving a path of destruction in his wake. But love conquers all, right? It has to. Because here I stand, ravaged and ruined, needing it to be true. You can't go back, but I want to. Back to the park. Back to when he sang only for me. Before he was famous. Before he shattered my heart. I thought I knew everything about him. But I could not have been more wrong. He promised me every tomorrow. And here I am, waiting. And hoping. Again. _______________________ Note: This is not a fluffy, light read or a swoony romance. It's a journey of love between two people who can't let each other go, even though they are far from perfect. It's about loving someone who is struggling with mental illness and addiction and all the ups and downs that come with it. It's about finding a happily ever after that works between two people loving each other the best they can with patience, understanding, and unconditional love. Not everyone will agree with this kind of love and acceptance - but it exists, and it's real, and it happens every day.	585	September 13th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36578619-no-tomorrow
