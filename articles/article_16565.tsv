Seers of Light	Light #1	Jennifer DeLucy	3.85	796	153	Lillian Hunt has never truly lived. Always sensing more to the world than is easily perceived, she fears that her instincts are stubborn flights of fancy, or worse, mental instability. But some things—disappearing strangers, tangible dreams, and visits from malevolent creatures—cannot be ignored. Before it's too late, Lillian is ripped from the only existence she’s ever known and thrust into a reality that she always suspected, but could scarcely believe. She must learn the truth about who she is, the powerful beings that wish to destroy her, and the two men who would die to protect her.	396	February 16th 2010	Christian Wright, Lillian Hunt, William Maddox		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7741856-seers-of-light
