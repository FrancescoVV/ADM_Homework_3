Chasing Vermeer	Chasing Vermeer #1	Blue Balliett, Brett Helquist	3.72	28301	2311	When a book of unexplainable occurrences brings Petra Andalee and Calder Pillay together, strange things start to happen: seemingly unrelated events connect, an eccentric old woman seeks their company, and an invaluable Vermeer painting disappears. Before they know it, the two find themselves at the center of an international art scandal, where no one — neighbors, parents, teachers — is spared from suspicion. As Petra and Calder are drawn clue by clue into a mysterious labyrinth, they must draw on their powers of intuition, their problem-solving skills, and their knowledge of Vermeer. Can they decipher a crime that has left even the FBI baffled?	254	June 1st 2004	Calder Pillay, Petra Andalee, Tommy Segovia	Chicago, Illinois (United States), Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444347.Chasing_Vermeer
