A Vision Beyond Abuse		Kathy Goodhew	4.62	21	10	She was born with a trusting nature, searching for her own identity within her family structure and in her own life. Unfulfilled and desperately seeking approval from those whom she loved and respected, Kathy naively placed her trust in the wrong person and soon found herself in a physically abusive relationship. Now she must find the strength to pick up the pieces of her brokenness and turn back to the only One who can put her together again-the Lord. In A Vision Beyond Abuse, Kathy Goodhew candidly writes about her fight to escape from the chains of abuse and find her way to peace. For anyone who struggles with pain from a broken past, know that you're not alone. Learn, along with Kathy, to find a vision beyond abuse and never give up hope in Jesus and the cross, where his grace pardons all sin.	123	February 22nd 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10360228-a-vision-beyond-abuse
