The Crown Conspiracy	The Riyria Revelations #1	Michael J. Sullivan	4.19	19291	1015	They killed the king. They pinned it on two men. They chose poorly. There is no ancient evil to defeat, no orphan destined for greatness, just two guys in the wrong place at the wrong time. Royce Melborn, a skilled thief, and his mercenary partner, Hadrian Blackwater make a profitable living carrying out dangerous assignments for conspiring nobles until they become the unwitting scapegoats in a plot to murder the king. Sentenced to death, they have only one way out...and so begins this tale of treachery and adventure, sword fighting and magic, myth and legend.	296	2008	Rolf Molenbeek, Hadriaan Zwartwater		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4345290-the-crown-conspiracy
