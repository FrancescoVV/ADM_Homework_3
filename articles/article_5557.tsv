The police have been trying to get enough evidence to nail him for more than twenty years. Now, four CHERUB agents are joining the hunt. Can a group of kids successfully infiltrate Keith Moore's organisation when dozens of attempts by undercover police officers have failed?

He needs to make a big splash if he's going to win the confidence of the man at the top.	291	2004	James Adams, Kyle Blueman, Kerry Chang		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1291211.Class_A
