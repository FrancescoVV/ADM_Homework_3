The Vegetarian		Han Kang, Deborah     Smith	3.58	93440	12632	Before the nightmare, Yeong-hye and her husband lived an ordinary life. But when splintering, blood-soaked images start haunting her thoughts, Yeong-hye decides to purge her mind and renounce eating meat. In a country where societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye's decision to embrace a more “plant-like” existence is a shocking act of subversion. And as her passive rebellion manifests in ever more extreme and frightening forms, scandal, abuse, and estrangement begin to send Yeong-hye spiraling deep into the spaces of her fantasy. In a complete metamorphosis of both mind and body, her now dangerous endeavor will take Yeong-hye—impossibly, ecstatically, tragically—far from her once-known self altogether.	188	October 30th 2007	Kim Yeong-hye, Kim In-hye	Seoul, South Korea (Korea, Republic of)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489025-the-vegetarian
