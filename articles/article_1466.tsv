Richard III	Wars of the Roses #8	William Shakespeare, John Jowett	3.93	43363	1699	This edition of Richard III features seven scenes, opening with the Duke of Gloucester’s villainous “Winter of our discontent” speech and followed by his audacious wooing of Lady Anne. Queen Margaret’s chilling curses, Richard’s string of murders, and the haunting chants of his victims’ ghosts are stage drama at its best. The climax is a gripping battle in which the Earl of Richmond slays Richard and becomes King of England. There is also an essay by editor Nick Newlin on how to produce a Shakespeare play with novice actors, and notes about the original production of this abridgement at the Folger Shakespeare Library’s annual Student Shakespeare Festival. The edition includes a preface by Nick Newlin, containing helpful advice on presenting Shakespeare in a high school setting with novice actors, as well as an appendix with play-specific suggestions and recommendations for further resources.	414	1593	Elizabeth of York, Elizabeth Woodville, Henry VII of England, Richard III of England, Henry VI of England, Edward IV of England, Jane Shore, Edward V of England, Margaret of Anjou, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, Sir Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset, Sir Richard Grey, Lord Grey, Sir Thomas Vaughan, Edward Plantagenet, Lady Anne Neville, William, Lord Hastings, Thomas, Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby, John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, Sir James Blunt, Sir Walter Herbert, Sir William Brandon, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, Sir Richard Ratcliffe, Sir William Catesby, Sir James Tyrrel, Francis Lovell, 9th Baron Lovell, 6th Baron Holand, Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, 1st Murderer (Richard III), 2nd Murderer (Richard III), Page to Richard III, Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Rotherham, Archbishop of York, John Morton, Bishop of Ely, Sir Christopher Urswick, John, a Priest, Sir Robert Brakenbury, Keeper of the Tower, Edmund Shaa, Lord Mayor of London, Scrivener, Pursuivant, Sheriff (Richard III), Tressel, gentleman attending Lady Anne, Berkeley, gentleman attending Lady Anne, Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, Margaret Plantagenet, John Dighton, Miles Forrest, 1st Citizen (Richard III), 2nd Citizen (Richard III), Third Citizen (Richard III)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42058.Richard_III
