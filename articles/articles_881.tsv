All Together Dead	Sookie Stackhouse #7	Charlaine Harris	4.05	187386	3623	Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has her hands full dealing with every sort of undead and paranormal creature imaginable. And after being betrayed by her longtime vampire love, Sookie must not only deal with a new man in her life—the shapeshifter Quinn—but also contend with the long-planned vampire summit. The summit is a tense situation. The vampire queen of Louisiana is in a precarious position, her power base weakened by hurricane damage to New Orleans. And there are some vamps who would like to finish what nature started. Soon, Sookie must decide what side she'll stand with. And her choice may mean the difference between survival and all-out catastrophe. And with HBO's launching of an all-new show, True Blood , based on the Southern Vampire novels, the demand for Charlaine Harris and Sookie Stackhouse is bigger than ever.	323	May 1st 2007	Sookie Stackhouse, Bill Compton, Sam Merlotte, Jason Stackhouse, Eric Northman, Tara Thornton, Quinn, Pam Ravenscroft, Sophie-Anne LeClerq, Barry "Bellboy" Horowitz, Russell Edgington	Bon Temps, Louisiana (United States), Northern Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140075.All_Together_Dead
