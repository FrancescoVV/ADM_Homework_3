Tales of the Peculiar	Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children #0.5	Ransom Riggs, Andrew   Davidson	4.15	24559	2796	Before Miss Peregrine gave them a home, the story of peculiars was written in the Tales. Wealthy cannibals who dine on the discarded limbs of peculiars. A fork-tongued princess. The origins of the first ymbryne. These are but a few of the truly brilliant stories in Tales of the Peculiar —known to hide information about the peculiar world—first introduced by Ransom Riggs in his Miss Peregrine’s Peculiar Children series. Riggs now invites you to share his secrets of peculiar history, with a collection of original stories, as collected and annotated by Millard Nullings, ward of Miss Peregrine and scholar of all things peculiar.	170	September 3rd 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358487-tales-of-the-peculiar
