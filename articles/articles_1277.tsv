Turtles All the Way Down is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts. In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.	286	October 10th 2017	Aza Holmes, Davis Pickett, Daisy Ramirez, Mychal Turner, Noah Pickett	Indianapolis, Indiana (United States), Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35504431-turtles-all-the-way-down
