One World Order		John Coleman	4.20	10	0	The enemy in washington is more to be feared than the enemy in Moscow Communism did not destroy tariff protection created by George Washington. Communism did not force the United States to adopt graduated income tax. Communism did not create the Federal Reserve Board. Communism did not force the United Nations on America. Communism did not take away the Panama Canal away from the American people. Communism did not create the Global 2000 report mass genocide plan. It is socialism that has brought forth these evils upon the United States. One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship tells how this was, and is being accomplished.	240	October 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6795139-one-world-order
