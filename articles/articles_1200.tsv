The Dharma Bums	Duluoz Legend	Jack Kerouac	3.91	84957	2926	Two ebullient young men search for Truth the Zen way: from marathon wine-drinking bouts, poetry jam sessions, and "yabyum" in San Francisco's Bohemia, to solitude in the high Sierras and a vigil atop Desolation Peak in Washington State. Published just a year after On the Road put the Beat Generation on the map, The Dharma Bums is sparked by Kerouac's expansiveness, humor, and a contagious zest for life.	244	1958	Ray Smith, Japhy Ryder	Oregon (United States), San Francisco, California (United States), Los Angeles, California (United States), South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/412732.The_Dharma_Bums
