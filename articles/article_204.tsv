Murder on the Orient Express	Hercule Poirot #10	Agatha Christie	4.17	384731	24037	Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside. Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murdererâ€”in case he or she decides to strike again.	347	1934	Samuel Edward Ratchett, Hector MacQueen, Masterman, Colonel Arbuthnot, Harriet Hubbard, Count Rudolf Andrenyi, Countess Elena Andrenyi, Princess Natalia Dragomiroff, Mary Debenham, Hildegarde Schmidt, Antonio Foscarel, Greta Ohlsson, Pierre Michel, Cyrus Hardman, Dr. Constantine, M.
