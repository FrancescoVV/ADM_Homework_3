Dance with a Vampire	Vampire Kisses #4	Ellen Schreiber	4.01	24713	547	There's a new vampire in town. His name is Valentine Maxwell. Goth-girl Raven knows this latest intruder can only mean trouble--he's the younger sibling of two vampires she fought to drive out of Dullsville. But when her brother, Billy, befriends this dangerous tween night prowler, the stakes are suddenly higher. Though torn by the excitement of every teen girl's fantasy--attending the prom with her boyfriend--Raven must do everything she can to protect Billy. Valentine's appearance may pose even further threats. Could he somehow know Raven's innermost feelings about becoming immortal for her true love, Alexander? The far-from-ordinary romance of these two teen outsiders takes another surprise-filled spin in the fourth book of Ellen Schreiber's applauded Vampire Kisses series.	179	July 1st 2007	Raven, Matt Zander, Trevor Mitchell, Luna Maxwell, Jagger Maxwell, Alexander Sterling, Jameson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263171.Dance_with_a_Vampire
