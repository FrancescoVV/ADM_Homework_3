The Rising Force	Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice #1	Dave Wolverton	3.85	4246	216	Twelve-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi desperately wants to be a Jedi Knight. After years at the Jedi Temple, he knows the power of the lightsaber and the Force. But he cannot control his own anger and fear. Because of this, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn will not take him on as a Padawan apprentice. Now Obi-Wan is about to have his first encounter with true evil. He must face off against unexpected enemies--and face up to his own dark wishes. Only then can his education as a Jedi truly begin.	171	January 1st 1999	Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Bruck Chun, Aalto, Bant Eerin, Reeft, Garen Muln, Clat'Ha, Jemba, Aggaba	Bandomeer, Coruscant	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148875.The_Rising_Force
