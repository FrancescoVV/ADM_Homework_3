Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals	The Cambridge Kant German-English Edition	Immanuel Kant, Mary J. Gregor, Christine M. Korsgaard	3.83	16615	477	Immanuel Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ranks alongside Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics as one of an influential work in moral philosophy. Its aim is to search for and establish the supreme principle of morality, the categorical imperative.

The introduction examines and explains Kant's argument.	120	1785			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60080.Groundwork_of_the_Metaphysics_of_Morals
