Twisted in You		Fabiola Francisco	4.55	64	40	No matter how far I moved to escape my past, the emotional pain is a heavy burden. Dealing with the abuse the only way I can, I turn to self-harm as a way to cope. Until one day I take it too far... Meeting Tyler in rehab reminds me of the ghosts of my past. He uses his career as a country music rockstar as an excuse for the life he leads full of alcohol, drugs, and women. But as I get to know him, something deeper sparks. I see the same pain I carry reflected in his eyes. When the past catches up, will he be able to protect me?		April 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33526058-twisted-in-you
