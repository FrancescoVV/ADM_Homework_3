Monkey: The Journey to the West		Wu Cheng'en, Arthur Waley, Hu Shih	4.01	5786	486	Probably the most popular book in the history of the Far East, this classic sixteenth century novel is a combination of picaresque novel and folk epic that mixes satire, allegory, and history into a rollicking adventure. It is the story of the roguish Monkey and his encounters with major and minor spirits, gods, demigods, demons, ogres, monsters, and fairies. This translation, by the distinguished scholar Arthur Waley, is the first accurate English version; it makes available to the Western reader a faithful reproduction of the spirit and meaning of the original.	306	1592	Monkey, Xuanzang, Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, 玄奘, 孙悟空, 猪八戒, 沙悟浄, Tripitaka, Pigsy, Sandy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100237.Monkey
