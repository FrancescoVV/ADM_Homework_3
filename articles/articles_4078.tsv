Now to earn his freedom and save his sister's life, he must complete one last kill. Powerful and ruthless, he'll stop at nothing to carry out this deadly mission. AN ANGEL TEMPTED Idess is an earthbound angel with a wild side, sworn to protect the human Lore is targeting. She's determined to thwart her wickedly handsome adversary by any means necessary-even if that means risking her vow of eternal chastity. But what begins as a simple seduction soon turns into a passion that leaves both angel and demon craving complete surrender. Torn between duty and desire, Lore and Idess must join forces as they battle their attraction for each other. Because an enemy from the past is rising again-one hellbent on vengeance and unthinkable destruction.	400	2010	Shade, Tayla Mancuso, Eidolon, Runa Wagner, Serena Kelley, Wraith (Demonica series), Conall Dearghul, Kynan Morgan, Reaver, Lore, Idess, Sin, Gemella Endri, Luc, Valko	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6660747-ecstasy-unveiled
