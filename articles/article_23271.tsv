Angels and Insects		A.S. Byatt	3.64	5286	323	In these breathtaking novellas, A.S. Byatt returns to the territory she explored in Possession : the landscape of Victorian England, where science and spiritualism are both popular manias, and domestic decorum coexists with brutality and perversion. Angels and Insects is "delicate and confidently ironic.... Byatt perfectly blends laughter and sympathy [with] extraordinary sensuality" ( San Francisco Examiner ).	352	October 19th 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298381.Angels_and_Insects
