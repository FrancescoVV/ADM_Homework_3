Fixing Delilah		Sarah Ockler	3.81	7741	663	Things in Delilah Hannaford's life have a tendency to fall apart. She used to be a good student, but she can't seem to keep it together anymore. Her "boyfriend" isn't much of a boyfriend. And her mother refuses to discuss the fight that divided their family eight years ago. Falling apart, it seems, is a Hannaford tradition. Over a summer of new friendships, unexpected romance, and moments that test the complex bonds between mothers and daughters, Delilah must face her family's painful past. Can even her most shattered relationships be pieced together again? Rich with emotion, Sarah Ockler delivers a powerful story of family, love, and self-discovery.	308	December 1st 2010	Delilah Elizabeth Hannaford, Claire Hannaford, Rachel Hannaford, Patrick Reese, Casey Conroy	Red Falls, Vermont (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7074259-fixing-delilah
