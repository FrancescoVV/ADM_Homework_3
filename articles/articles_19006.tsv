It has been three months from that terrible day when Jonas Fairbanks ripped her heart out and trampled it to the ground. Devastated and heartbroken, Julia must find a way to move on with her life. But how? He gave her everything and took everything from her. Her first kiss. Her dream. Her light. Her soul. Her heart—all with His Secret—a double life. A new life waits for Julia in Paris—and so does new love. Luke McCarthy finds Julia at an airport on the day she is leaving for Paris and starting her life over. He’s everything that reminds her of Jonas, so much to the fact—it’s uncanny.

But Julia has a secret of her own now—and Jonas is never going to find out. Julia may have found a new life—However, the past will always find you. Jonas: “I meant what I said.
