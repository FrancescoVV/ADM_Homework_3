Chicka Chicka Boom Boom	Chicka Chicka #1	Bill Martin Jr., John Archambault, Lois Ehlert	4.23	148471	4579	The 26 characters in this rhythmic, rhyming baby book are a lowercase alphabet with attitude. "A told b, and b told c, 'I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree'"--which probably seemed like a good idea until the other 23 members of the gang decided to follow suit. The palm tree standing straight and tall on the first page begins to groan and bend under its alphabetical burden. First the coconuts fall off, then ("Chicka chicka... BOOM! BOOM!") all the letters also end up in a big heap underneath.	40	1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293595.Chicka_Chicka_Boom_Boom
