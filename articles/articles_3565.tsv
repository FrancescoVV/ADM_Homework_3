Inside his house, playing video games with the shades drawn. Greg, a self-confessed "indoor person,” is living out his ultimate summer fantasy: no responsibilities and no rules. But Greg’s mom has a different vision for an ideal summer . . . one packed with outdoor activities and "family togetherness.” Whose vision will win out? Or will a new addition to the Heffley family change everything?	218	October 12th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6578293-dog-days
