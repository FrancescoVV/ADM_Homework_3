Love Waits		Gerri Hill	4.04	1866	94	High school sweethearts…and nobody knew. Ashleigh Pence had been the all-American high school girl: cheerleader, prom queen…and in love with another girl. Gina Granbury hasn’t thought about Calloway High in twenty years, but the arrival of the invitation to the class reunion brings back memories of Ashleigh and the betrayal that drove them apart. With no real choice, Ashleigh has to go the event, hoping that it’s not the one reunion that Gina decides to attend after all these years. Gina had expected to dismiss the possibility as easily as she has during all the years since, but the curiosity is suddenly strong. Her long-broken heart has never mended, but that’s no reason to go back in time…is it? Twenty years seem like yesterday in this latest passionate story from Golden Crown award winner Gerri Hill.	264	July 12th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7962312-love-waits
