Vivian Apple at the End of the World	Vivian Apple #1	Katie Coyle	3.73	5121	964	Seventeen-year-old Vivian Apple never believed in the evangelical Church of America, unlike her recently devout parents. But when Vivian returns home the night after the supposed "Rapture," all thatâ€™s left of her parents are two holes in the roof. Suddenly, she doesn't know who or what to believe. With her best friend Harp and a mysterious ally, Peter, Vivian embarks on a desperate cross-country roadtrip through a paranoid and panic-stricken America to find answers. Because at the end of the world, Vivan Apple isn't looking for a savior. She's looking for the truth.	262	August 5th 2013	Vivian Apple, Peter Ivey, Harpreet Janda, Beaton Frick	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20256737-vivian-apple-at-the-end-of-the-world
