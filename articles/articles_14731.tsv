Upon the Midnight Clear	Dark-Hunter #12	Sherrilyn Kenyon	4.00	26676	760	Ever think Scrooge had it right before the ghosts ruined his life? Meet Aidan O'Conner. At one time he was a world-renowned celebrity who gave freely of himself and his money without wanting anything in return...until those around him took without asking. Now Aidan wants nothing of the world--or anyone who's a part of it. When a stranger appears at his doorstep, Aidan knows he's seen her before…in his dreams. Born on Olympus as a goddess, Leta knows nothing of the human world. But a ruthless enemy has driven her from the world of dreams and into the home of the only man who can help her: Aidan. Her immortal powers are derived from human emotions--and his anger is just the fuel she needs to defend herself… One cold winter's night will change their lives forever… Trapped together in a brutal winter storm, Aidan and Leta must turn to the only power capable of saving them--or destroying them both: trust.	282	October 30th 2007	Aidan O’Conner, Leta Oeneros Skotos, M’Adoc, Deimos "Demon"	Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490403.Upon_the_Midnight_Clear
