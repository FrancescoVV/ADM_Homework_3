The Ruins		Scott        Smith, Patrick Wilson	3.58	32629	3786	Trapped in the Mexican jungle, a group of friends stumble upon a creeping horror unlike anything they could ever imagine. Two young couples are on a lazy Mexican vacation–sun-drenched days, drunken nights, making friends with fellow tourists. When the brother of one of those friends disappears, they decide to venture into the jungle to look for him. What started out as a fun day-trip slowly spirals into a nightmare when they find an ancient ruins site . . . and the terrifying presence that lurks there.	319	2006	Jeff, Eric Ross, Alyec Ilychovich, Pablo Soler, Stacy, Mathias	Cancún (Mexico), Mexico	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21726.The_Ruins
