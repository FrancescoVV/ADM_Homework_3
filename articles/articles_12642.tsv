In the Dark		Loreth Anne White	4.06	15948	1065	A secluded mountain lodge. The perfect getaway. So remote no one will ever find you. The promise of a luxury vacation at a secluded wilderness spa has brought together eight lucky guests. But nothing is what they were led to believe. As a fierce storm barrels down and all contact with the outside is cut off, the guests fear that it’s not a getaway. It’s a trap. Each one has a secret. Each one has something to hide. And now, as darkness closes in, they all have something to fear—including one another. Alerted to the vanished party of strangers, homicide cop Mason Deniaud and search and rescue expert Callie Sutton must brave the brutal elements of the mountains to find them. But even Mason and Callie have no idea how precious time is. Because the clock is ticking, and one by one, the guests of Forest Shadow Lodge are being hunted. For them, surviving becomes part of a diabolical game.	407	December 1st 2019		British Columbia (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44527037-in-the-dark
