The Cripple of Inishmaan - Acting Edition (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)		Martin McDonagh	4.08	2709	139	In 1934, the people of Inishmaan learn that the Hollywood director Robert Flaherty is coming to the neighboring island to film a documentary. No one is more excited than Cripple Billy, an unloved boy whose chief occupation has been grazing at cows and yearning for a girl who wants no part of him. For Billy is determined to cross the sea and audition for the Yank. And as news of his audacity ripples through his rumor-starved community, The Cripple of Inishmaan becomes a merciless portrayal of a world so comically cramped and mean-spirited that hope is an affront to its order.	72	1997	Billy Claven, Kate Osbourne, Eileen Osbourne, Johnnypateenmike, Helen McCormick	Aran Islands (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/538740.The_Cripple_of_Inishmaan
