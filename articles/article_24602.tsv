Iron Wolves	Order of the Centurion  #2	Jonathan Yanez, Jason Anspach, Nick Cole	4.41	446	26	There can be no victory without sacrifice. The Iron Wolves are a company of legionnaires whose legendary exploits date back to the Savage Wars. When they are invited to be guests of honor at a ceremony on a small, backwater planet, they look forward to some precious time away from the constant conflicts of galaxy's edge. But when a neighboring country invades, disrupting the ceremony and killing innocents, the Wolves are forced to make an impossible decision. Aid a people pleading for their protection... or obey the cynical orders of their Senate to stand down and see how the dust settles. Taking their careers and lives into their hands, the Iron Wolves and local militia form a brotherhood determined to fight for what they believe in. War is on the wind, the battle is at hand, and the Legion is on the move once more. Strap on your bucket, grab your blaster, and start reading today. The Iron Wolves call and death is on the hunt.	198	March 5th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43681826-iron-wolves
