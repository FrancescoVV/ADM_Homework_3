The Hidden Genes of Professor K	Jack Rogan Mysteries #3	Gabriel Farago	4.39	112	36	A medical breakthrough. A greedy pharmaceutical magnate. A brutal double-murder. One tangled web of lies. World-renowned scientist, Professor K is close to a ground-breaking discovery. He’s also dying. With his last breath, he anoints Dr Alexandra Delacroix his successor and pleads with her to carry on his work. But powerful forces will stop at nothing to possess the research, unwittingly plunging Delacroix into a treacherous world of unbridled ambition and greed. Desperate and alone, she turns to celebrated author and journalist, Jack Rogan. Rogan must help Delacroix while also assisting famous rock star Isis in the seemingly unrelated investigation into the brutal murder of her parents. With the support of Isis’ resourceful PA, a former police officer, a tireless campaigner for the destitute and forgotten, and a gifted boy with psychic powers, Rogan exposes a complex web of fiercely guarded secrets and heinous crimes of the past that can ruin them all and change history. Will the dreams of a visionary scientist with the power to change the future of medicine fall into the wrong hands, or will his genius benefit mankind and prevent untold misery and suffering for generations to come?
