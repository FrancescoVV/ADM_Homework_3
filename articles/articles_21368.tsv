Legionnaire	Galaxy's Edge #1	Jason Anspach, Nick Cole	4.08	4499	348	The Galaxy is a Dumpster Fire A hot, stinking, dumpster fire. And most days I don’t know if the legionnaires are putting out the flames, or fanning them into an inferno. A hostile force ambushes Victory Company during a reconnaissance-in-force deep inside enemy territory. Stranded behind enemy lines, a sergeant must lead a band of survivors against merciless insurgents on a deadly alien world somewhere along the galaxy’s edge. With no room for error, the Republic’s elite fighting force must struggle to survive under siege while waiting on a rescue that might never come. When you think you’ve surrounded the Legion... you’ve just made your last mistake.	308	June 12th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35427016-legionnaire
