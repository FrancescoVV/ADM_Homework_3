Sunset in Central Park	From Manhattan with Love #2	Sarah Morgan	3.96	5258	676	In the chaos of New York, true love can be hard to find, even when it's been right under your nose all along… Love has never been a priority for garden designer Frankie Cole. After witnessing the fallout of her parents' divorce, she's seen the devastation an overload of emotion can cause. The only man she feels comfortable with is her friend Matt—but that's strictly platonic. If only she found it easier to ignore the way he makes her heart race… Matt Walker has loved Frankie for years but, sensing how fragile she is beneath her feisty exterior, has always played it cool. But then he uncovers new depths to the girl he's known forever and doesn't want to wait a moment longer. He knows Frankie has secrets and has buried them deep, but can Matt persuade her to trust him with her heart and kiss him under the Manhattan sunset?	384	July 14th 2016	Matt Walker, Frankie Cole		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28507386-sunset-in-central-park
