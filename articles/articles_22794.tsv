Unfortunately, her playfulness and enthusiasm aren't always well received and she finds herself dismissed from yet another position.

About to depart for Newport, Rhode Island, for the summer, he’s desperate for competent childcare. At wit’s end with both Millie and Everett, the employment agency gives them one last chance–with each other. As Millie falls in love with her mischievous charges, Everett focuses on achieving the coveted societal status of the upper echelons. But as he investigates the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of the children’s parents, will it take the loss of those he loves to learn whose company he truly wants for the rest of his life?	347	June 30th 2015	Millie Longfellow, Everett Mulberry		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23411534-in-good-company
