Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea / The Mysterious Island / Journey to the Centre of the Earth / Around the World in Eighty Days		Jules Verne	4.12	289	9	A pioneer of the now immensely popular genre of fiction we call science fiction, Jules Verne wrote startling adventure stories that not only vividly captured the imagination of the 19th-century reading public, but are still read avidly today. Filled with wondrous voyages, marvelous semi-scientific equipment, and warnings not to tamper too much with the natural order, his novels are not only universally popular, but have proved to be uncannily prophetic. Here are four of Verne's most enthralling stories: 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, The Mysterious Island, Journey To The Center Of The Earth, and Around The World In 80 Days. Each one explores different themes, but all share one in common: man's exploration of the dark unknown.	1154	June 1st 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827177.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea_The_Mysterious_Island_Journey_to_the_Centre_of_the_Earth_Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days
