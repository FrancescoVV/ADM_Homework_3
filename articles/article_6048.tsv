Forever . . .		Judy Blume	3.62	53841	3913	Katherine and Michael meet at a New Year's Eve party. They're attracted to each other, they grow to love each other. And once they've decided their love is forever, they make love. It's the beginning of an intense and exclusive relationship, with a future all planned. Until Katherine's parents insist that she and Michael put their love to the test with a summer apart... Forever is written for an older age group than Judy Blume's other novels for children. It caused a storm of controversy when it was first published because of its explicit sexual content.	178	1975	Katherine Danziger, Michael Wagner		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37743.Forever_
