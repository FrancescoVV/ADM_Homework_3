Our Man in Havana		Graham Greene	3.94	26890	1877	Graham Greene's classic Cuban spy story, now with a new package and a new introduction First published in 1959, Our Man in Havana is an espionage thriller, a penetrating character study, and a political satire that still resonates to this day. Conceived as one of Graham Greene's 'entertainments,' it tells of MI6's man in Havana, Wormold, a former vacuum-cleaner salesman turned reluctant secret agent out of economic necessity. To keep his job, he files bogus reports based on Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare and dreams up military installations from vacuum-cleaner designs. Then his stories start coming disturbingly true.	220	1958	James Wormold, Hawthorne, Beatrice Severn	Havana (Cuba), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133394.Our_Man_in_Havana
