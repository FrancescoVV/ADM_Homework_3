Steam Pigs		Melissa Lucashenko	4.14	43	3	Sue Wilson, young and Aboriginal, escapes her 'too-large, too-poor family in a too-small' north Queensland town for Logan City's frontier sprawl. Entering 'the mythic world of Work' she discovers that the view from behind the bar is less than glamorous, but pays the rent. When she meets Roger the good times begin to roll until she finds herself starring in a feature with medium level violence.		October 1st 1998		Logan City (Australia)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1417493.Steam_Pigs
