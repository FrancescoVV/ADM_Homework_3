Time's Arrow		Martin Amis	3.71	14733	1085	In Time's Arrow the doctor Tod T. Friendly dies and then feels markedly better, breaks up with his lovers as a prelude to seducing them, and mangles his patients before he sends them home. And all the while Tod's life races backward in time toward the one appalling moment in modern history when such reversals make sense.	165	September 26th 1991	Odilo Unverdorben, Reverend Nicholas Kreditor	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23031.Time_s_Arrow
