And she has the multimillion-dollar Miami pad and Aston Martin to prove it.

Someone has gotten to the people on her payroll and an unknown enemy is sabotaging her every move. With the list of people she can depend on dwindling, Yoshi's got to toughen up if she's going to survive. . . More praise for Kiki Swinson ""Kiki Swinson is unstoppable.
