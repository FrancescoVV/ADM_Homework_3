On The Trail of Delusion: Jim Garrison: The Great Accuser		Fred Litwin	5.00	10	8	Fred Litwin exposes the truth about Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney, who ‘solved’ the JFK assassination in 1967. On the Trail of Delusion shows how Garrison persecuted an innocent gay man in order to spout his crazy conspiracy theories. There is also a touch of bribery and intimidation, the story of his attempt to charge a dead man with being a grassy knoll assassin, the former Marine he believed was a ‘second Oswald,’ several con men who turned the tables and fooled Garrison, the use of truth serum and hypnosis to recover memories, the ugly story of Oliver Stone’s homophobic film JFK, and a lawyer from Montreal who was unjustly accused of operating an international assassination bureau. There’s even a chapter with flying saucers. And a whole lot more.		September 28th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55517031-on-the-trail-of-delusion
