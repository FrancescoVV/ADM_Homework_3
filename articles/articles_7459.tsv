Sea Change		Aimee Friedman	3.63	6604	728	Sixteen-year-old Miranda Merchant is great at science. . .and not so great with boys. After major drama with her boyfriend and (now ex) best friend, she's happy to spend the summer on small, mysterious Selkie Island, helping her mother sort out her late grandmother's estate. There, Miranda finds new friends and an island with a mysterious, mystical history, presenting her with facts her logical, scientific mind can't make sense of. She also meets Leo, who challenges everything she thought she knew about boys, friendship. . .and reality. Is Leo hiding something? Or is he something that she never could have imagined?	320	June 1st 2009	Mirandra Merchant, Leo Macleod	Selkie Island, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5598960-sea-change
