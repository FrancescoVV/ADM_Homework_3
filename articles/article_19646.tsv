Meditations: Philosophical Contemplations of a Roman Emperor		Marcus Aurelius, George Long	4.22	126673	6481	"Meditations" is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from second century, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy. Marcus Aurelius wrote the Meditations as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The Meditations is divided into 12 books that chronicle different periods of Marcus' life. A central theme to Meditations is the importance of analyzing one's judgment of self and others and the development of a cosmic perspective. The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Marcus' Stoic perspective on the text.	131	180	Antoninus Pius	Roman Empire	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations
