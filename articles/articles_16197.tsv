The Clue in the Crumbling Wall	Nancy Drew Mystery Stories #22	Carolyn Keene	3.91	5846	147	A sprawling estate was willed to a dancer who has vanished several years earlier. During their investigation at Heath Castle, Nancy, Bess and George realize that its crumbling walls contain a secret, but what is it? They search for clues in the neglected gardens of the vast estate, hoping to find a lead to the missing woman. Danger lurks in a castle tower and throughout the vine-tangled grounds as Nancy exposes a sinister plot to defraud the dancer of her inheritance. This book is the revised text. The plot of the original story (Â©1945) is similar with minor revisions.	181	February 1st 1945			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/862004.The_Clue_in_the_Crumbling_Wall
