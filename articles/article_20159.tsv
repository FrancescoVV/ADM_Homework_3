How Right You Are, Jeeves	Jeeves #12	P.G. Wodehouse	4.16	5442	500	A Bertie and Jeeves classic, featuring a cow-creamer, the redheaded Miss Wickham, and the formidable schoolmaster Aubrey Upjohn. Jeeves is infallible. Jeeves is indispensable. Unfortunately, in How Right You Are, Jeeves, he is also in absentia. In this wonderful slice of Woosterian mayhem, Bertie has sent that prince among gentlemen's gentlemen off on his annual vacation. Soon, drowning dachshunds, broken engagements, and inextricable complications lead to the only possible conclusion: "We must put our trust in a higher power. Go and fetch Jeeves!"	206	1960	Reginald Jeeves, Dahlia Travers, Bertram Wilberforce Wooster, Roderick Glossop, Anatole, Reginald Herring, Aubrey Upjohn, Roberta Wickham, Thomas Portarlington Travers, Lady Wickham, Bonzo Travers, Seppings, Homer Cream, Adela Cream, Wilbert Cream, Phyllis Mills, Poppet		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16377.How_Right_You_Are_Jeeves
