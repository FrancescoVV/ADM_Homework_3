My Loose Thread		Dennis Cooper	3.48	1172	62	Larry is a teenager wrestling not only with his sexuality and the implications of a physical relationship with his younger brother, but with the very point of his existence. He is numb to almost all that surrounds him. As the book opens, Larry has been paid $500 by a senior to kill a fellow student and retrieve the boy's notebook. It seems simple enough. However, once Larry delves into the notebook, complications arise. An immensely powerful work that explores teenage depression, moral vacuity, and the confusion of love, this is a claustrophobic and harrowing piece of fiction.	130	2002		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51591.My_Loose_Thread
