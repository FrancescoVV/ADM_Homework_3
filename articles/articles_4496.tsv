Runaway	Airhead #3	Meg Cabot	3.91	23476	955	EM WATTS IS ON THE RUN She's on the run from school, from work, from her family, from her friends, from herself. With everyone she loves furious with her for something she can't explain, and nothing but the live Stark Angel fashion show on New Year's Eve to look forward to, Em's reached the end of her rope... what's the point of even going on? But when she discovers the truth about Nikki's secret, she knows there's only one person she can turn to. Will Christopher be able to put aside his personal feelings and help her expose her employer to the world? Is it even fair to get Christopher involved - since if he agrees, there's every chance that Stark Enterprises will try to have them both killed - this time, permanently? MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO KEEP ON RUNNING	310	May 7th 2010	Emerson Watts, Nikki Howard, Lulu Collins, Christopher Maloney, Brandon Stark, Robert Stark		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6460331-runaway
