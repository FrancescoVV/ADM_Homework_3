The Charmed Return	Faerie Path #6	Allan Frewin Jones	4.01	1737	96	The thrilling conclusion to the Faerie Path series, in which Tania, the long-lost princess of Faerie, ultimately must choose between her two worlds. She was once a princess of Faerie, the seventh daughter of King Oberon. But sixteen-year-old Anita Palmer wakes up in London with no memory of the Faerie Realm; her princess identity; her true love, Edric; or her quest to save Faerie from a deadly plague that ravaged it. Anita must reawaken Tania, her Faerie self... but how? And who can she trust when not even her memories are safe? Her quest leads to a thrilling final battle, with her own destiny—as well as the fate of both the Faerie and the Mortal World—at stake. Teen faery books are more popular than ever, and the final book in the Faerie Path series is perfect for readers who are looking for action, romance, and adventure.	368	January 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8448478-the-charmed-return
