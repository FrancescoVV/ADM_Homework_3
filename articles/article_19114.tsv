The Everafter		Amy Huntley	3.71	4637	682	Madison Stanton doesn't know where she is or how she got there. But she does know this - she is dead. And alone in a vast, dark space. The only company Maddy has in this place are luminescent objects that turn out to be all the things she lost while she was alive. And soon she discovers that, with these artifacts, she can reexperience - and even change - moments from her life. Her first kiss. A trip to Disney World. Her sister's wedding. A disastrous sleepover. In reliving these moments, Maddy learns illuminating and frightening truths about her life - and death.	248	September 29th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6371243-the-everafter
