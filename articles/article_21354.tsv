Cancer Trip: Curing Cancer with Humour. And Pot. And Chemo.		Steve Parton	4.00	3	1	Steve Parton is from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He has a unique take on cancer, and really wants to not die (yet). He was diagnosed in 2013, and has been using the disease as a platform for humour. Itâ€™s been a rough journey for him, but he has succeeded in staying positive. One of the battles he faces is that between conventional and naturopathic medicines. In the book, he shows how he manages to find the best of both worlds, and he uses that to his advantage. This is written as a journal, but it reads like a fluid book. His is not a story of pity, but one of learning to face a horrible disease with a bit of bravery and a great deal of humour.	182	May 7th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35264777-cancer-trip
