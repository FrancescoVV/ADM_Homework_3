Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West		Cormac McCarthy	4.17	109488	9812	Blood Meridian is an epic novel of the violence and depravity that attended America's westward expansion, brilliantly subverting the conventions of the Western novel and the mythology of the Wild West. Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennesseean who stumbles into a nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.	351	April 28th 1985	The kid, Judge Holden, Louis Toadvine, Captain White, John Joel Glanton, Benjamin Tobin, David Brown, John Jackson	Mexico, Texas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394535.Blood_Meridian_or_the_Evening_Redness_in_the_West
