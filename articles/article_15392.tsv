Mr. Darcy, Vampyre		Amanda Grange	2.89	4949	869	A married man in possession of a dark fortune must be in want of an eternal wife... My hand is trembling as I write this letter. My nerves are in tatters and I am so altered that I believe you would not recognize me. The past two months have been a nightmarish whirl of strange and disturbing circumstances, and the future... I am afraid. If anything happens to me, remember that I love you and that my spirit will always be with you, though we may never see each other again. The world is a cold and frightening place where nothing is as it seems.	308	August 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6691280-mr-darcy-vampyre
