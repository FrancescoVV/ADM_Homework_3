Cryer's Cross		Lisa McMann	3.73	10456	1697	Kendall loves her life in small town Cryer's Cross, Montana, but she also longs for something more. She knows the chances of going to school in New York are small, but she's not the type to give up easily. Even though it will mean leaving Nico, the world's sweetest boyfriend, behind. But when Cryer's Cross is rocked by unspeakable tragedy, Kendall shoves her dreams aside and focuses on just one goal: help find her missing friends. Even if it means spending time with the one boy she shouldn't get close to... the one boy who makes her question everything she feels for Nico. Determined to help and to stay true to the boy she's always loved, Kendall keeps up the search--and stumbles upon some frightening local history. She knows she can't stop digging, but Kendall is about to find out just how far the townspeople will go to keep their secrets buried....	233	February 8th 2011	Kendall Fletcher, Nico Cruz, Jaci√°n Obregon, Tiffany Quinn, Marlena Obregon	Cryer's Cross, Montana (United States), Montana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8543252-cryer-s-cross
