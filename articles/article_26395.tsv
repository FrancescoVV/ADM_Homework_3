Louis de Bernières Box Set of 3 books: The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts / Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord / The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzmán	Latin American Trilogy	Louis de Bernières	4.50	642	55	This rambunctious first novel by the author of the bestselling Corelli's Mandolin is set in an impoverished, violent, yet ravishingly beautiful country somewhere in South America. When the haughty Dona Constanza decides to divert a river to fill her swimming pool, the consequences are at once tragic, heroic, and outrageously funny. "Walks a precarious edge between slapstick and pathos, never once losing its balance."Washington Post Book World.	0	1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/873890.Louis_de_Berni_res_Box_Set_of_3_books
