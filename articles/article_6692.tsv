The Emperor's Edge	The Emperor's Edge #1	Lindsay Buroker	4.03	12830	1349	The adventure starts here... Imperial law enforcer Amaranthe Lokdon is good at her job: she can deter thieves and pacify thugs, if not with a blade, then by toppling an eight-foot pile of coffee canisters onto their heads. But when ravaged bodies show up on the waterfront, an arson covers up human sacrifices, and a powerful business coalition plots to kill the emperor, she feels a tad overwhelmed. Worse, Sicarius, the empire's most notorious assassin, is in town. He's tied in with the chaos somehow, but Amaranthe would be a fool to cross his path. Unfortunately, her superiors order her to hunt him down. Either they have an unprecedented belief in her skills... or someone wants her dead.	324	December 22nd 2010	Amaranthe Lokdon, Sicarius, Marl "Books" Mugdildor, Maldynado Montichelu, Basilard, Akstyr, Sespian Savarsin		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10031259-the-emperor-s-edge
