Grog Wars		Anne Sweazy-Kulju	4.47	15	10	Who will win the war for love and beer? A self-made German brewer would willingly give it all for the love of his woman--while another, lesser man would seek to take it all and rid of the woman. Let the battles beginï¿½ Forced into an arranged marriage and dispatched to a strange new country, a German Brew Master learned he would do almost anything for love. In 1849, Burke Kaufmann survived the first leg of his journey: the cross Atlantic voyage and the "floating coffin ships." Then he endured the Oregon Trail during its bloodiest history, with Aussie pal Queensy Gray in tow, and in due course he landed in Portland, Oregon--"Shanghai capital," and arguably the most dangerous place on earth. Fighting for his life throughout his dangerous trek had succeeded in curing Kaufmann of his depression. The experience also made him enormously wealthy; he was finally able to send for his bride, Lily. When he did, Burke's greatest danger so far arrived with her.	322	December 30th 2014		Oregon Trail (United States), Portland, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18397729-grog-wars
