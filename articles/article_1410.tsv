The Surgeon	Rizzoli & Isles #1	Tess Gerritsen	4.09	133560	4327	IN BOSTON, THERE'S A KILLER ON THE LOOSE... A killer who targets lone women, who breaks into their apartments and performs terrifying ritualistic acts of torture on them before finishing them off. His surgical skills lead police to suspect he is a physician - a physician who, instead of saving lives, takes them. But as homicide detective Thomas Moore and his partner Jane Rizzoli begin their investigation, they make a startling discovery. Closely linked to these killings is Catherine Cordell, a beautiful doctor with a mysterious past. Two years ago she was subjected to a horrifying rape and shot her attacker dead. Now the man she believes she killed seems to be stalking her once again, and this time he knows exactly where to find her...	416	2001	Jane Rizzoli, Thomas Moore, Catherine Cordell	Boston, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32263.The_Surgeon
