The Power of One	The Power of One #1	Bryce Courtenay	4.33	79833	5264	In 1939, as Hitler casts his enormous, cruel shadow across the world, the seeds of apartheid take root in South Africa. There, a boy called Peekay is born. His childhood is marked by humiliation and abandonment, yet he vows to survive and conceives heroic dreams, which are nothing compared to what life actually has in store for him. He embarks on an epic journey through a land of tribal superstition and modern prejudice where he will learn the power of words, the power to transform lives and the power of one.	544	1989	"Doc" Bradley Stanwick, Peekay, Geel Piet, Morris Levy, The Judge, Mrs. Boxall, Miss Bornstein	South Africa	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122.The_Power_of_One
