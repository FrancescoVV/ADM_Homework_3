This Song Will Save Your Life		Leila Sales	3.92	25706	3695	Making friends has never been Elise Dembowski’s strong suit. All throughout her life, she’s been the butt of every joke and the outsider in every conversation. When a final attempt at popularity fails, Elise nearly gives up. Then she stumbles upon a warehouse party where she meets Vicky, a girl in a band who accepts her; Char, a cute, yet mysterious disc jockey; Pippa, a carefree spirit from England; and most importantly, a love for DJing. Told in a refreshingly genuine and laugh-out-loud funny voice, This Song Will Save Your Life is an exuberant novel about identity, friendship, and the power of music to bring people together.	276	September 17th 2013	Elise Dembowski	Glendale, Rhode Island (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15777621-this-song-will-save-your-life
