Set includes all four books in the popular series that reached #1 in teen paranormal reads and Greek mythology. Seventeen year old Kris Young is on the run from a throng of superhuman, golden-eyed freaks hell-bent on seeing her dead, and she doesn't know why. Good thing she has her guardian angel to protect her...sort of. Kris is aided by Nathan, the mysterious man that ends up being anything but angelic when he rescues her for the fourth time in fourteen years. Even if the handsome hero illusion is shattered by his harsh treatment of her, he knows how to fight this strange enemy and is determined to keep her safe at all costs. As the body count rises in their wake, Nathan introduces Kris to a world in which not everyone is human and the battle lines between good and evil are clearly drawn. Kris's piece in the puzzle is something neither is aware of and, as they uncover the truth, neither is prepared for what they find. Overcoming twists and revelations that shatter both of their lives, they discover that nothing is as it seems and nothing, least of all their hearts, are safe. Experience The Ignited Series, and read an enthralling tale of first love, friendship, heartbreak, mystery and adventure that will introduce you to an exciting new world as Kris discovers how she fits in it.	1229	February 26th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38885711-the-ignited-series
