Binders Full of Women		Lana Cordova	3.33	57	5	Well, someone had to do it. The Binders Full of Women comment was just begging to be sexploited - - and avenged. I was hoping to have this completed before the election, but alas, it was not to be. However, I hope you enjoy this deliciously naughty romp about a struggling young attorney, Jennifer Long, who worked her way through law school as a dominatrix. She dreams of a job in state government. Forced to take a job well beneath her qualifications as the governor's executive secretary, she soon learns that the capitol is full of sexist good 'ol boys who see women as playthings and have no intentions of trying to ensure that the government staff is truly representative of the population, which is about half female. Watch Jennifer beat the boys at their own dirty game. Binders Full of Women is available exclusively at Amazon.com. Free for Amazon Prime Kindle Owners! Only .99 for purchase!
