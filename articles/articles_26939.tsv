A Flower Reborn		Kirstin  Graham	5.00	3	2	"Even in the worst circumstances, a flower can be reborn with the right love and care." Azalea never thought she'd find someone who could relate to her after everything that had happened until she met Tabby, a pale-skinned young woman with bleach blonde hair, a gorgeous smile and a similar attitude to the world at a group counselling retreat for teens. As their friendship grows more, their worlds start to crumble around them. Can they both survive living a normal life after all they've been through by standing together, or will the pain of their pasts be their end?
