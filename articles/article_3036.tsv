At least they would be paying attention to me…” So thinks Andy, the boy everyone makes fun of because he’s really skinny and wears glasses and talks to himself, the nerdiest kid in the class, who falls in love with the prettiest girl in the class. Andy believes that he will show all the geeks that one of them can go out with the queen of the class! And one day it happens, thanks to Grandpa who has turned into a ghost. Ever since, Andy can see all kinds of ghosts and talk to them, and that's why he is the only one who can save the lovely Zoe from the evil spirit that got into her home.
