Slave to Sensation	Psy-Changeling #1	Nalini Singh	4.11	62084	3942	Dive into a world torn apart by a powerful race with phenomenal powers of the mind— and none of the heart… In a world that denies emotions, where the ruling Psy punish any sign of desire, Sascha Duncan must conceal the feelings that brand her as flawed. To reveal them would be to sentence herself to the horror of “rehabilitation”— the complete psychic erasure of everything she ever was…. Both human and animal, Lucas Hunter is a Changeling hungry for the very sensations the Psy disdain. After centuries of uneasy co-existence, these two races are now on the verge of war over the brutal murders of several Changeling women. Lucas is determined to find the Psy killer who butchered his packmate, and Sascha is his ticket into their closely guarded society. But he soon discovers that this ice-cold Psy is very capable of passion—and that the animal in him is fascinated by her. Caught between their conflicting worlds, Lucas and Sascha must remain bound to their identities—or sacrifice everything for a taste of darkest temptation…	334	September 5th 2006	Sascha Duncan, Lucas Hunter, Brenna Shane Kincaid, Judd Lauren, Clay Bennett, Mercy Smith, Hawke Snow, Walker Lauren, Sienna Lauren, Nate Ryder, Tamsyn Mahaire, Dorian Christensen, Kit Monahan, Nikita Duncan, Vaughn D'Angelo	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178476.Slave_to_Sensation
