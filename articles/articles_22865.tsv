Black Nationhood: Resurgence of African Consciousness		LaTonya Page-Balkcom	5.00	1	0	HOTEP BELOVED! Caution! This Pocket Edition Book "BLACK NATIONHOOD" perhaps, contain information that may stimulate independent thinking, and do away with the brainwashed mind. We must endeavor to embark upon this life-altering voyage of The Resurgence of African Awareness, African Consciousness, and Culture. Some of us are many moons on this journey of Consciousness, but for some, this is a first. It will be as challenging as taking a final exam while standing on one leg with a barking dog in the background. For others, it will be like trying to walk on a broken leg without the assistance of a pair of crutches. In any event, successful completion is the only option. For those who are ready and willing to grow, heal, change, and build perhaps, this book will challenge your mind to research, and learn about yourselves, and how the resurgence of African Awareness and Culture works. Black Culture has become this degenerative society where love, peace, joy & the pursuit of happiness is foreign and looks more like the dysfunction of a low-life animalistic society, with horrible behaviors. The majority of Teachers did not lecture students about real African history or Black culture that would have enhanced their self-awareness, personal and spiritual growth. Learning who you are and where you originated is imperative for clarity, vitality, and freedom. This book will challenge you to transform your mind. No more upside down, inside out, and backward thinking and enslaved mind. It's time to be Free. I challenge you to take this Journey. Much Love to all of you!	102	September 23rd 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27035829-black-nationhood
