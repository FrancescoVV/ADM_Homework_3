With Charity Toward None: A Fond Look At Misanthropy		Florence King	4.02	302	30	The unreconstructed people-hater offers her piece de resistance: a guided tour of the misanthropic life, and an inspirational handbook for Americans grown tired of goo-goo humanitarianism and sensitivity that never sleeps. The only trouble with this book is that its covers are too close together.--The New York Times.	208	March 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/851572.With_Charity_Toward_None
