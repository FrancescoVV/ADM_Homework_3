The Art of War/The Prince		Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Henry Neville, W.K. Marriott	4.07	967	38	This special edition of "The Art of War" by Machiavelli & "The Prince" by Machiavelli unites both of Machiavelli's renowned volumes on strategy together, so that the philosophy and mechanisms for obtaining power and managing power may be seen as a single entity. Possessed of a great intellect, Niccolo Machiavelli was uniquely suited to examine and explain the important details of statecraft. Machiavelli, like Plato, Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd decades before him, saw only one method by which a thinking man, himself not powerful, might do the work of state building, by seizing the imagination of a Prince. With these writings, he has influenced the history of the world. Machiavelli has so influenced human civilization that the very term: Machiavellian, has come to mean that which is characterized by expediency, deceit, and cunning. A prime example is his advice: "A wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher." His advice, on this and other suggested intrigues, has been heeded by various heads of state for over four hundred years.
