Nathaniel		John Saul	3.84	5399	157	For a hundred years, the people of Prairie Bend have whispered Nathaniel's name in wonder and fear. Some say he is a folktale, created to frighten children on cold winter nights. Some swear he is a terrifying spirit returned to avenge the past. But soon... very soon... some will learn that Nathaniel lives still--that he is darkly, horrifyingly real. Nathaniel--he is the voice that calls to young Michael Hall across the prairie night... the voice that draws the boy into the shadowy depths of the old, crumbling, forbidden barn... that chanting, compelling voice he will follow faithfully beyond the edge of terror.	343	January 1st 1984	Nathaniel, Michael Hall, Janet Hall, Amos Hall, Anna Hall, Laura Hall Shields, Ryan Shields	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239906.Nathaniel
