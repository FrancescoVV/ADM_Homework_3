Amok Koşucusu		Stefan Zweig, Nafer Ermiş	4.03	9153	775	On a sweltering ocean-liner travelling from India to Europe a passenger tells his story--the tale of a doctor in the Dutch East Indies torn between his duty and the pull of his emotions; a tale of power and maddening desire, of pride, shame and a headlong flight into folly. 'Amok' is one of the most intense and incisive of the tales that brought Stefan Zweig to worldwide fame.
