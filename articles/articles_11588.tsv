The Village by the Sea		Anita Desai	3.61	3178	213	Forgotten by the evolution of the centuries and indifferent to the advances of the twentieth century, Thul, a tiny fishing village not far from Bombay, continues to follow those rhythms of the seasons that have always been handed down. Hari and Lila were born and raised in the village, but now their family is falling into despair: the father to alcohol while the mother is seriously ill. As for money, that there is not even enough to meet the most basic needs between.	272	1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/275600.The_Village_by_the_Sea
