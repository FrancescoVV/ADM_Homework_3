The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying		Sogyal Rinpoche, Andrew Harvey	4.20	24584	689	A newly revised and updated edition of the internationally bestselling spiritual classic, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying , written by Sogyal Rinpoche, is the ultimate introduction to Tibetan Buddhist wisdom. An enlightening, inspiring, and comforting manual for life and death that the New York Times calls, “The Tibetan equivalent of [Dante’s] The Divine Comedy ,” this is the essential work that moved Huston Smith, author of The World’s Religions , to proclaim, “I have encountered no book on the interplay of life and death that is more comprehensive, practical, and wise.”	464	January 1st 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40383078-the-tibetan-book-of-living-and-dying
