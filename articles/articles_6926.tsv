Ink and Bone	The Great Library #1	Rachel Caine	3.96	22769	4177	Ruthless and supremely powerful, the Great Library is now a presence in every major city, governing the flow of knowledge to the masses.

Jess Brightwell believes in the value of the Library, but the majority of his knowledge comes from illegal books obtained by his family, who are involved in the thriving black market. Jess has been sent to be his family’s spy, but his loyalties are tested in the final months of his training to enter the Library’s service. When his friend inadvertently commits heresy by creating a device that could change the world, Jess discovers that those who control the Great Library believe that knowledge is more valuable than any human life—and soon both heretics and books will burn…	352	July 7th 2015	Jess Brightwell, Morgan Hault, Thomas Schreiber, Christopher Wolfe, Niccolò Santi, Dario Santiago, Khalila Seif	London, England (United Kingdom), Alexandria (Egypt)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20643052-ink-and-bone
