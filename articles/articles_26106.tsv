Revenge of the Homecoming Queen	Aspen Brooks #1	Stephanie Hale	3.51	918	130	All that matters is what's inside...as long as there's a tiara on the outside. The flawless Aspen Brooks was born to be Homecoming Queen. Naturally she's dating the most popular guy in school, and she's blessed with stunning good looks, excellent style, and mega brains. She's got the crown in the bag. So why is the tiara being placed on the skanky head of cheerleader Angel Ives? The confusion only grows after ultra-dork Rand Bachrach is crowned king. To Aspen's shock and horror, Angel actually accuses her of being behind this. Whatevs! But then something goes terribly, terribly wrong. Strange things start happening--even stranger than Angel beating Aspen. Now someone's leaving her threatening messages and slashing her tires. She's sure it's that beyotch Angel doing these things. And if Angel wants war, by Dooney & Bourke she'll get one.	304	July 3rd 2007	Aspen Brooks, Angel Ives, Rand Bachrach, Lucas Riley		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332402.Revenge_of_the_Homecoming_Queen
