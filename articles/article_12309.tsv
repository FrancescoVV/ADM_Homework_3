Junia	Lives of the Early Christians in Rome #1	Michael E. Giesler	4.22	186	18	As the beautiful daughter of a Roman senator, Junia enjoyed the best that life had to offer in first century Rome. She was grateful and anxious to please her family, a dutiful and obedient young woman of privilege. That is, until a chance friendship and its abrupt end sparks an interest in a new religion that will lead to a destiny she never imagined. Junia is a fictional exploration of life at the very beginning of Christianity from a very personal point of view. It shows how the attractions of the new religion were accompanied by social struggle, family division, and the risk of a disgraceful death to those courageous enough to embrace it. The author is a priest of the Prelature of Opus Dei in St. Louis.	120	August 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9988704-junia
