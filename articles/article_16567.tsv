The Return of Rafe MacKade	The MacKade Brothers #1	Nora Roberts	4.10	12716	478	THE TOWN WAS BUZZING OVER RAFE's RETURN... Some said there would be trouble. Bound to be. Trouble hung around Rafe MacKade like a bell around a bull's neck. Oh, he was as handsome as ever, with those devil's good looks the MacKades were gifted -- or cursed -- with. If a female had breath in her body, she couldn't help but look twice at that loose-legged stride that seemed to dare anyone to get in the way. And what about that newcomer, Regan Bishop? Pretty as a picture, but a little prim. Would she be impervious to the legendary MacKade charm? Sure didn't look that way.... The MacKade Brothers: Looking for trouble -- and always finding it. Now they're on a collision course with love.	256	April 1st 1995	Regan Jones, Rafe MacKade, Regan Bishop	Antietam, Maryland (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/682150.The_Return_of_Rafe_MacKade
