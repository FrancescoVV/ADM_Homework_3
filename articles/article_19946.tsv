Bite Marks	Jaz Parks #6	Jennifer Rardin	4.07	3910	144	Jaz Parks here. But I'm not alone. I'm hearing voices in my head -- and they're not mine. The problem, or maybe the solution, is work. And the job's a stinker this time -- killing the gnomes that are threatening to topple NASA's Australian-based space complex. Yeah, I know. Vayl and I should still be able to kick this one in our sleep. Except that Hell has thrown up a demon named Kyphas to knock us off track. And damn is she indestructible!	314	October 29th 2009	Jaz Parks, Cassandra (divers), Vayl, Cole, Bergman		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6339619-bite-marks
