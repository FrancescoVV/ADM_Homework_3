BURGUNDY DOUBLOONS & THE HIGH PRIESTESS OF NEW ORLEANS!		T.J. Spencer Jacques	4.52	23	6	How long should you wait for an apology, before you take revenge? How long does it take to say three simple words – I am sorry? Too long, as it relates to the hurtful actions of uptown resident Jack McGowan. Her patience has expired, and the principal of her pain plus interest is now past due. Jack was a rising superstar in the Carnival Krewe of Caesar and was even voted president, but then something happened on Mardi Gras night that yanked his star out of the sky. In New Orleans, there’s an old saying that is as assured “you may not pay for it today, maybe not tomorrow, but you will pay for it.” She lives by that creole code, a heart for a heart is the only atonement. She is Kuhani Nalah, The High Priestess of New Orleans. Welcome to Burgundy Doubloons – another Classic New Orleans Novel.	368	June 18th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40640552-burgundy-doubloons-the-high-priestess-of-new-orleans
