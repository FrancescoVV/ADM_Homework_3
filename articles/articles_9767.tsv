The Mirror		Marlys Millhiser	4.03	4771	676	On the eve of her wedding in 1978, Shay Garrett peers into the antique mirror in her family's longtime home, the famous Victorian Gingerbread House on Pearl Street in Boulder, Colorado, and falls unconscious only to wake in the body of her own grandmother Brandy on the eve of her wedding—in 1900. The virginal Brandy, in turn, awakes in Shay's body to discover herself pregnant. What follows is a fascinating look at how two women—and their families—cope with this strange situation.	303	1978	Shay Garrett, Brandy McCabe, Hutch Maddon, Corbin Strock, Lon Maddon, Thora K, Marek Weir	Denver, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133738.The_Mirror
