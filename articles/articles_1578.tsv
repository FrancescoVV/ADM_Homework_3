Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family		Thomas Mann, T.J. Reed, John E. Woods	4.16	21833	1147	Buddenbrooks, first published in Germany in 1901, when Mann was only twenty-six, has become a classic of modern literature. It is the story of four generations of a wealthy bourgeois family in northern Germany facing the advent of modernity; in an uncertain new world, the family’s bonds and traditions begin to disintegrate. As Mann charts the Buddenbrooks’ decline from prosperity to bankruptcy, from moral and psychic soundness to sickly piety, artistic decadence, and madness, he ushers the reader into a world of stunning vitality, pieced together from births and funerals, weddings and divorces, recipes, gossip, and earthy humor. In its immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, buddenbrooks surpasses all other modern family chronicles. With remarkable fidelity to the original German text, this superb translation emphasizes the magnificent scale of Mann’s achievement in this riveting, tragic novel.	731	1901	Buddenbrooks, Antonie Buddenbrook, Johann Buddenbrook, Elisabeth Buddenbrook, Ida Jungmann, Thomas Buddenbrook, Christian Buddenbrook, Jean Jacques Hoffstede, Lebrecht Kröger, Gotthold Buddenbrook, Justus Kröger, Klothilde, Julie Hagenström, Clara Buddenbrook, Peter Döhlmann, Sesame Weichbrodt, Armgard von Schilling, Gerda Arnoldsen, Bendix Grünlich, Morten Schwarzkopf, Siegismund Gosch, Erika Grünlich, Jakob Kröger, Jürgen Kröger, Sievert Tiburtius, Alois Permaneder, Hanno Buddenbrook, Hugo Weinschenk, Edmund Pfühl, Hermann Hagenström, Kai Mölln	Germany, Lübeck (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80890.Buddenbrooks
