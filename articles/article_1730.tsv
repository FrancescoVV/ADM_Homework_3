Night Play	Dark-Hunter #5	Sherrilyn Kenyon	4.35	50766	1604	Bride McTierney has had it with men. They're cheap, self-centered, and never love her for who she is. But though she prides herself on being independent, deep down she still yearns for a knight in shining armor. She just never expected her knight in shining armor to have a shiny coat of fur... Deadly and tortured, Vane Kattalakis isn't what he seems. Most women lament that their boyfriends are dogs. In Bride's case, hers is a wolf. A Were-Hunter wolf. Wanted dead by his enemies, Vane isn't looking for a mate. But the Fates have marked Bride as his. Now he has three weeks to either convince Bride that the supernatural is real or he will spend the rest of his life neuteredâ€”something no self-respecting wolf can accept... But how does a wolf convince a human to trust him with her life when his enemies are out to end his? In the world of the Were-Hunters, it really is dog-eat-dog. And only one alpha male can win.	362	August 3rd 2004	Nicholas Ambrosius Gautier, Wren Tigarian, Kyrian of Thrace, Amanda Devereaux, Tabitha Devereaux Magnus, Vane Kattalakis, Bride McTierney, Grace Alexander, Aimee Peltier, Fang Kattalakis, Simi, Cherise Nicole Gautier, Devereaux Aubert Peltier, Colt Theodorakopolis, Kyle Peltier, Yasmina Devereaux, Jasyn Kallinos, Aubert Peltier (Papa Bear), Nicolette Peltier (Mama Lo), Remi Peltier, Marissa Hunter, Julian of Macedonia (Hunter Legends series), Fury Kattalakis	New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84151.Night_Play
