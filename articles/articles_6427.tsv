Anne of Windy Poplars	Anne of Green Gables #4	L.M. Montgomery	4.05	73727	2451	Anne Shirley has left Redmond College behind to begin a new job and a new chapter of her life away from Green Gables. Now she faces a new challenge: the Pringles. They're known as the royal family of Summerside--and they quickly let Anne know she is not the person they had wanted as principal of Summerside High School. But as she settles into the cozy tower room at Windy Poplars, Anne finds she has great allies in the widows Aunt Kate and Aunt Chatty--and in their irrepressible housekeeper, Rebecca Dew. As Anne learns Summerside's strangest secrets, winning the support of the prickly Pringles becomes only the first of her delicious triumphs.	288	1936	Diana Barry, Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, Jen Pringle, Rebecca Dew, Elizabeth Grayson, Katherine Brooke, Pauline Gibson, Pierce Grayson, Sophy Sinclair	Canada, Prince Edward Island (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65840.Anne_of_Windy_Poplars
