God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?		John C. Lennox	4.29	1429	156	Intended to provide a basis for discussion, this book evaluates the evidence of modern science in relation to the debate between the atheistic and theistic interpretations of the universe. Written like a scientific detective story, this excellent introduction to the current debate grew out of the author's lengthy experience of lecturing and debating on the subject.	192	October 1st 2002	Richard Dawkins		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1648212.God_s_Undertaker
