This time, I'm fighting for her. After seven years. After breaking his heart and dismissing my own, I'm still very much his. I never intended to return home, but to help my sisters, I'll confront my past...and William Bailey, the man whose eyes remind me of the girl I was, the things I've done, and the future I've lost. This would all be easier if William hated me. But he wants to be in my life, my secrets be damned. If he learns the truth, it will destroy him.	246	September 30th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18365945-wish-i-may
