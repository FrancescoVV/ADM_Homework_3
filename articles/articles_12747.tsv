Homeric Hymns		Homer, Jules Cashford, Nicholas Richardson	4.03	4838	141	Composed for recitation at festivals, these 33 songs were written in honour of the gods and goddesses of the ancient Greek pantheon. They recount the key episodes in the lives of the gods, and dramatise the moments when they first appear before mortals. Together they offer the most vivid picture we have of the Greek view of the relationship between the divine and human worlds.	174	-600			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278316.Homeric_Hymns
