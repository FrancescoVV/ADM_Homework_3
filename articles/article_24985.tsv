Nicholas and Alexandra	The Romanovs #3	Robert K. Massie	4.22	25329	1267	The story of the love that ended an empire. In this commanding book, Pulitzer Prize–winning author Robert K. Massie sweeps readers back to the extraordinary world of Imperial Russia to tell the story of the Romanovs’ lives: Nicholas’s political naïveté, Alexandra’s obsession with the corrupt mystic Rasputin, and little Alexis’s brave struggle with hemophilia. Against a lavish backdrop of luxury and intrigue, Massie unfolds a powerful drama of passion and history—the story of a doomed empire and the death-marked royals who watched it crumble.	640	June 30th 1967	Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna, Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia, Nicholas II of Russia	Russian Federation	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133486.Nicholas_and_Alexandra
