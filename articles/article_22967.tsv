Fantastic Night & Other Stories		Stefan Zweig	4.01	11509	776	'I alone know that I am only just beginning to live.' He is distinguished, rich, a member of fashionable society-utterlybored. But, over the course of one fantastic night, a young Baron becomes a thief, unashamed, and awakes to life for the first time. This collection is full of tales of infinite passions, of intense encounters that transform lives, a knock on a door that forces a whole community to take flight, a doomed attempt to save a soul poisoned by addiction, a love soured into awful cruelty, of longing and liberation. They are the gripping work of a master storyteller, unmatched and completely unforgettable.	168	1922			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27839637-ola-an-st-bir-gece
