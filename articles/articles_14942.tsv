Shaman King, Vol. 1: A Shaman in Tokyo	Shaman King #1	Hiroyuki Takei	4.15	16922	138	From award-winning Hiroyuki Takei, Shaman King was produced as a hit anime in 2001. When he takes a shortcut through a cemetery, Manta Oyamada meets a strange kid with headphones — surrounded by ghosts. The kid is the teenage shaman Yoh Asakura. Tapping the supernatural swordfighting powers of samurai ghost Admidamaru, Yoh fights Bokuto no Ryu, a sword-wielding gang member. But an even more dangerous opponent is stalking Yoh and Manta — a Chinese shaman who wants to possess Amidamaru.	208	December 3rd 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/885744.Shaman_King_Vol_1
