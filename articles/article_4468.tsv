The Legend of Luke	Redwall #12	Brian Jacques	4.01	15496	199	In this twelfth book in the masterful Redwall epic, storyteller Brian Jacques goes back in time to the days before Redwall, revealing with dramatic poignancy the legend of the first of the magnificent Redwall warriors--Luke, father of Martin. It is that legend Martin hopes to discover when he embarks on a perilous journey to the northland shore, where his father abandoned him as a child. There, within the carcass of a great red ship he uncovers what he has been searching for: the story of the evil Pirate stoat, Vilu Daskar, and the valiant mousewarrior who pursued him relentlessly over the high seas, seeking to destroy Vilu at all costs, even if it meant deserting his only son. Brian Jacques reaches a new pinnacle in storytelling, imparting the story behind the story of the greatest Redwall warrior of them all.	374	January 10th 1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7987.The_Legend_of_Luke
