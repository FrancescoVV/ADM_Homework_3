The Intruder		Debbie Lacy	5.00	3	1	Mrs. Wendy Tremble was very a lonely widow who lived alone in a very large two-story home in New Jersey. The affliction of her arthritis discomfort hindered her mobility and was restricted to the home, which depressed her greatly. She longed for frequent visits by her son and his family but concluded that they had their own lives to live and didnâ€™t want to be a burden to them, yet living in that big house alone was a bit much for her and was often terrified in the night by the strange sounds from the upstairs level of her home.	11	February 11th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24888554-the-intruder
