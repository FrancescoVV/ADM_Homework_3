The Disciplined Trader: Developing Winning Attitudes		Mark Douglas	4.16	922	59	The classic book that introduced the investment industry to the concept of trading psychology. With rare insight based on his firsthand commodity trading experience, author Mark Douglas demonstrates how the mental matters that allow us function effectively in society are often psychological barriers in trading. After examining how we develop losing attitudes, this book prepares you for a thorough "mental housecleaning" of deeply rooted thought processes. And then it shows the reader how to develop and apply attitudes and behaviors that transcend psychological obstacles and lead to success. The Disciplined Trader helps you join the elite few who have learned how to control their trading behavior (the few traders who consistently take the greatest percentage of profits out of the market) by developing a systematic, step-by-step approach to winning week after week, month after month. The book is divided into three parts: - An overview of the psychological requirements of the trading environment - A definition of the problems and challenges of becoming a successful trader - Basic insights into what behavior may need to be changed, and how to build a framework for accomplishing this goal - How to develop specific trading skills based on a clear, objective perspective on market action "A groundbreaking work published in 1990 examining as to why most traders cannot raise their equity on a consistent basis, bringing the reader to practical conclusions to go about changing any limiting mindset."--Larry Pesavento, TradingTutor.com	256	April 1st 1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1170470.The_Disciplined_Trader
