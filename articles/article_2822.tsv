When the nineteenth-century ghost of Maria de Silva wakes her up in the middle of the night, Suze knows this is no ordinary visitation - and not just from the knife at her throat, either. In life, Maria was the fianc√©e of Jesse - the same Jesse who was murdered a hundred and fifty years before. The same Jesse Suze is in love with. Maria threatens Suze: The backyard construction must cease. Suze has a pretty good idea what - or rather, who - Maria doesn't want found. But in solving Jesse's murder, will Suze end up losing him forever?	316	December 1st 2001	Susannah "Suze" Simon, Hector de Silva (Jesse), Father Dominic, Paul Slater, Jack Slater, Maria de Silva, CeeCee Webb, Adam McTavish, Andy Ackerman, Jake Ackerman (Sleepy), Brad Ackerman (Dopey), David Ackerman (Doc), Rick Slater, Nancy Slater, Clive Clemmings	Carmel-by-the-Sea, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23224.Darkest_Hour
