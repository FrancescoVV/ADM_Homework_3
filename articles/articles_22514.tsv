Bane of the Innocent		Oliver Phipps	4.26	62	14	"There's no reason for them to shoot us; we ain't anyone" - Sammy, Bane of the Innocent. Two young boys become unlikely companions during the fall of Atlanta. Sammy and Ben somehow find themselves, and each other, in the rapidly changing and chaotic environment of the war torn Georgia City. As the siege ends and the fall begins in late August and early September of 1864, the Confederate troops begin to move out and Union forces cautiously move into the city. Ben and Sammy simply struggle to survive, but in the process they develop a friendship that will prove more important than either one could imagine.	94	June 9th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22853617-bane-of-the-innocent
