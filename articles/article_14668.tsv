Mick Harte Was Here		Barbara Park	4.25	3529	496	How could someone like Mick die? He was the kid who freaked out his mom by putting a ceramic eye in a defrosted chicken, the kid who did a wild dance in front of the whole school—and the kid who, if only he had worn his bicycle helmet, would still be alive today. But now Phoebe Harte's twelve-year-old brother is gone, and Phoebe's world has turned upside down. With her trademark candor and compassion, beloved middle-grade writer Barbara Park tells how Phoebe copes with her painful loss in this story filled with sadness, humor—and hope. Chosen by "Publishers Weekly" as one of their Best Books of 1996. "A full-fledged and fully convincing drama."—(Publishers Weekly	86	January 1st 1995	Mick Harte, Phoebe Harte	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/500799.Mick_Harte_Was_Here
