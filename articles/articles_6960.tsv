The Consolations of Philosophy		Alain de Botton	4.01	22599	2144	Alain de Botton's The Consolations of Philosophy takes the discipline of logic and the mind back to its roots. Drawing inspiration from six of the finest minds in history - Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche - he addresses lack of money, the pain of love, inadequacy, anxiety and conformity. De Botton's book led one critic to call philosophy 'the new rock and roll'.	265	January 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23419.The_Consolations_of_Philosophy
