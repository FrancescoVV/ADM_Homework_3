Twenty Chickens for a Saddle		Robyn Scott	3.87	2413	308	In this brilliant, hilarious memoir, Robyn Scott recounts the years living in Botswana while her dad works as a flying doctor. At first she thinks her parents don't have the best ideas, but soon she begins to realize the importance of her father's work. Botswana has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world, but still no one wants to talk about it and, for once, Scott is proud that her parents are willing to be unconventional.	320	2008		Botswana	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2314553.Twenty_Chickens_for_a_Saddle
