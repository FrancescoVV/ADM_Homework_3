Hometown Girl Forever	Hometown #3	Kirsten Fullmer	4.30	915	40	Lizzie gave up her stressful job in Boston to embrace her love of all things country in Smithville PA. Her farm, a new job at the spa, and her pet alpacas are a dream come true, if only her meddling, matchmaking, socialite mother would back off. Elliot, a successful architect from Washington, DC, designed the new spa, but he certainly hadn't envisioned the exotic bohemian style manager or her intriguing, demanding mother. Small town antics and his interest in Lizzie extend his visit to Smithville, but will the allure of country life draw him in for good? Once again, Smithvilleâ€™s folk interfere with plans at every turn, forcing Lizzie and Elliot to face their personal dilemmas and each other, head on.	297	August 11th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38201210-hometown-girl-forever
