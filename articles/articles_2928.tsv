Rilla of Ingleside	Anne of Green Gables #8	L.M. Montgomery	4.20	39506	1871	Anne's children are almost grown up, except for pretty, high-spirited Rilla. No one can resist her bright hazel eyes and dazzling smile. Rilla, almost fifteen, can't think any further ahead than going to her very first dance at the Four Winds lighthouse and getting her first kiss from handsome Kenneth Ford. But undreamed-of challenges await the irrepressible Rilla when the world of Ingleside is endangered by a far-off war. Her brothers go off to fight, and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn in a soup tureen. She is swept into a drama that tests her courage and changes her forever.	277	1921	Gilbert Blythe, Bertha Marilla (Rilla) Blythe, Anne Shirley, James Matthew Blythe, Walter Blythe, Anne (Nan) Blythe, Diana Blythe, Shirley Blythe, Jerry Meredith, Faith Meredith, Una Meredith, Carl Meredith, Susan Baker, Miller Douglas, Kenneth Ford, James Kitchener (Jims) Anderson, Irene Howard, Gertrude Oliver, Sophia Crawford, Fred Arnold, Josiah Pryor, Miranda Pryor, Joe Milgrave, Bruce Meredith	Prince Edward Island (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433533.Rilla_of_Ingleside
