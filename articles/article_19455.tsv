The Holy Bible, Douay-Rheims Version		Anonymous	4.60	1207	51	The Catholic Holy Bible - Church Authorized Douay-Rheims / Rheims-Douai / D-R / Douai Bible (Kindle MasterLink Technology): Complete ... Testament (Bible for Kindle / Kindle Bible) OVERVIEW The Definitive Roman Catholic Bible in English is the Douay-Rheims Bible. Also known as the Rheims–Douai Bible or Douai Bible, and abbreviated as D–R, the Douay-Rheims Version of the Holy Bible, is a direct English translation of what is still the authoritative Bible of the Catholic Church - the Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome (342-420). The Douay-Rheims Bible was fully revised by Catholic Bishop Richard Challoner Revision (Imprimatur 1899), and this revised version is regarded by many in the Catholic Church to be the best and most reliable translation of the Bible in the world.
