The Red Queen	The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels #3	Philippa Gregory	3.79	63156	4575	The second book in Philippa's stunning new trilogy, The Cousins' War, brings to life the story of Margaret Beaufort, a shadowy and mysterious character in the first book of the series - The White Queen - but who now takes centre stage in the bitter struggle of The War of the Roses. The Red Queen tells the story of the child-bride of Edmund Tudor, who, although widowed in her early teens, uses her determination of character and wily plotting to infiltrate the house of York under the guise of loyal friend and servant, undermine the support for Richard III and ultimately ensure that her only son, Henry Tudor, triumphs as King of England. Through collaboration with the dowager Queen Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret agrees to a betrothal between Henry and Elizabeth's daughter, thereby uniting the families and resolving the Cousins War once and for all by founding of the Tudor dynasty.	412	August 3rd 2010	Elizabeth of York, Elizabeth Woodville, Henry VII of England, Richard III of England, Henry VI of England, Edward IV of England, Anne Neville, Margaret of Anjou, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, Margaret Beaufort, Edmund Tudor, Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7148256-the-red-queen
