Power Stones: The Dragon's Blood Prophecy (Power Stones Series Book 3)		B.S. Barker	4.75	16	0	Baseball, bike rides, and frosty colas help pass the summer, but not quickly enough for Max Martin and his friends. Finally, they return to Monolitho for their third year at the Academy for Stone Holders. As Axials, they have GIMM Ball tryouts and new classes to take on. Trouble strikes early when there’s a kidnap attempt on Max. But why? Nobody seems to know, and Max must now watch his back at every turn. With the Mimicking Marauder locked up in Minotrague, who could be after him? Could it be Master Remi Gort, his new arrogant power studies professor? Or another one of Sagarta’s followers? Perhaps, there are new traitors lurking in the shadows of Monolitho.	384	May 15th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36469581-power-stones
