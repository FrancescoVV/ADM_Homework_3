The Hypnotist	Joona Linna #1	Lars Kepler, Ann Long	3.71	49635	4005	Prepare for The Hypnotist to cast its spell In the frigid clime of Tumba, Sweden, a gruesome triple homicide attracts the interest of Detective Inspector Joona Linna, who demands to investigate the murders. The killer is still at large, and there’s only one surviving witness—the boy whose family was killed before his eyes. Whoever committed the crimes wanted this boy to die: he’s suffered more than one hundred knife wounds and lapsed into a state of shock. Desperate for information, Linna sees only one option: hypnotism. He enlists Dr. Erik Maria Bark to mesmerize the boy, hoping to discover the killer through his eyes. It’s the sort of work that Bark has sworn he would never do again—ethically dubious and psychically scarring. When he breaks his promise and hypnotizes the victim, a long and terrifying chain of events begins to unfurl. An international sensation, The Hypnotist is set to appear in thirty-seven countries, and it has landed at the top of bestseller lists wherever it’s been published—in France, Holland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark. Now it’s America’s turn. Combining the addictive power of the Stieg Larsson trilogy with the storytelling drive of The Silence of the Lambs , this adrenaline-drenched thriller is spellbinding from its very first page.	503	January 2nd 2009	Joona Linna, Erik Maria Bark, Simone Bark, Benjamin Bark, Daniella Richards, Josef Ek, Lisa Ek, Evelyn Ek, Anders Ek, Katja Ek, Benny Rubin, Anja Larsson, Petter Näslund, Magdalena Ronander, Yngve Svensson, Carlos Eliasson, Nils Åhlen, Lillemor Blom, Erland Björkander, Susanne Granat, Jens Svanehjälm, Sorab Ramadani, Lisbet Carlén, Disa, Anna Katrin Eriksson, Erixon, Mikael Verner, Kennet Sträng, Ylva, Sim Shulman, Fredrik Stensund, Eva Blau, Maja Svartling, Marek, Pierre, Lydia Evers, Charlotte Cederskiöld, Sibel, Jussi, Annika Lorentzon, Ole Tovefjäll, Birk Jansson, Ola Jacobsson, Joakim Samuelsson, Isabella Samuelsson, Johan Samuelsson, Langfeldt, Annbrit	Tumba (Sweden), Dorotea (Sweden)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9835731-the-hypnotist
