U-10		Sam B. Miller II	4.34	378	23	The U-10 is a survival kit you might not survive using. Activated by unreadable cards, it could create a can of soup - - or an explosive grenade that looks like a can of soup. The U-10 is a guessing game of life or death. A top-secret paramilitary agency wants the U-10 and its gadgets, the guy who has the U-10 wants to keep it, and the alien who lost the U-10 wants it back. A death squad is dispatched to retrieve the U-10 and will stop at nothing, including the destruction of Earth, to accomplish their mission. Using the U-10 to heal battle wounds produces unexpected results. What good is a U-10 survival kit that has just three options? (A) Saves you. (B) Kills you. (C) Turns you into an alien?	348	August 10th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51106657-u-10
