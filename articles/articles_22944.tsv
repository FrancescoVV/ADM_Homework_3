The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation, Volume 2	The Complete Works of Aristotle #2	Aristotle, Jonathan Barnes	4.55	313	6	The Oxford Translation of Aristotle was originally published in 12 volumes between 1912 & 1954. It is universally recognized as the standard English version of Aristotle. This revised edition contains the substance of the original Translation, slightly emended in light of recent scholarship; three of the original versions have been replaced by new translations; and a new and enlarged selection of Fragments has been added. The aim of the translation remains the same: to make the surviving works of Aristotle readily accessible to English speaking readers.	1644	-322			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1272069.The_Complete_Works_of_Aristotle
