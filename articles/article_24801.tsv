In Search of Prehistoric Survivors: Do Giant 'Extinct' Creatures Still Exist?		Karl Shuker	4.10	29	4	Scientists recently found the coelanth, an archaic lobe-finned fish, lurking on the ocean floor, looking exactly like its ancestors in fossils dating back 70 million years. The question this book tries to answer is: How many more "extinct" species are out there, awaiting discovery? Colorfully illustrated accounts are given of contemporary encounters with winged beasts reminiscent of pterodactyls, with prehistoric giant vultures, and with sea creatures clearly related to plesiosaurian sea serpents. Here is the most complete account yet of the amazing discoveries which were dismissed as foolishness just a few years ago.	192	January 1st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6085231-in-search-of-prehistoric-survivors
