The Dragon Factory	Joe Ledger #2	Jonathan Maberry	4.14	9154	586	Joe Ledger and the DMS (Department of Military Sciences) go up against two competing groups of geneticists. One side is creating exotic transgenic monsters and genetically enhanced mercenary armies; the other is using 21st century technology to continue the Nazi Master Race program begun by Josef Mengele. Both sides want to see the DMS destroyed, and they've drawn first blood. Neither side is prepared for Joe Ledger as he leads Echo Team to war under a black flag.	486	January 1st 2010	Joe Ledger, Grace Courtland, Rudy Sanchez, Mr. Church, Bunny, Top		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6962671-the-dragon-factory
