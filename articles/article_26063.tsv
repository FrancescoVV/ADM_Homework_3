The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared	The Hundred-Year-Old Man #1	Jonas Jonasson, Rod Bradbury	3.82	215602	22922	It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson. Sitting quietly in his room in an old people’s home, he is waiting for the party he-never-wanted-anyway to begin. The Mayor is going to be there. The press is going to be there. But, as it turns out, Allan is not… Slowly but surely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in his slippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikely journey involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan’s earlier life in which – remarkably – he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century. Already a huge bestseller across Europe, The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared is a fun and feel-good book for all ages.	396	September 9th 2009	Allan Karlsson, Julius Jonsson, Benny Ljungberg, Gunilla Björklund, Per-Gunnar Gerdin, Herbert Einstein, Amanda Einstein, Göran Aronsson	Malmköping (Sweden), Los Alamos, New Mexico (United States), Washington, D.C.
