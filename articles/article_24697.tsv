Into the White: Scott's Antarctic Odyssey		Joanna Grochowicz	4.00	73	19	"Great God, this is an awful place." Robert Falcon Scott's famous words uttered on the polar plateau don't paint Antarctica in the best possible light. In fact things were about to get a whole lot worse for Scott and the four men who accompanied him to the South Pole. But this is no dismal tragedy. The story of Captain Scott's Terra Nova expedition is pure adventure with all the elements of a great epicâ€”storms at sea, impenetrable ice pack, man-eating whales, crevasses, blizzards, scientific discovery, bad food, extreme temperatures, and equal measures of hunger, agony and snow blindness. With a cast of memorable characters, vicious dogs and reluctant ponies, Captain Scott plans to be first to reach the South Pole. Will the weather hold? Will the rations be adequate? How will they know when they get there? And who invited the Norwegians? Into the White will leave you on the edge of your seat, hoping against hope that Scott and his men just might survive their Antarctic ordeal and live to tell the tale.	288	2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34734847-into-the-white
