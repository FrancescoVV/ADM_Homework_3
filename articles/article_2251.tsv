The Book of Life	All Souls Trilogy #3	Deborah Harkness	4.17	138895	11017	The #1 New York Times bestselling series finale and sequel to A Discovery of Witches and Shadow of Night Bringing the magic and suspense of the All Souls Trilogy to a deeply satisfying conclusion, this highly anticipated finale went straight to #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. In The Book of Life, Diana and Matthew time-travel back from Elizabethan London to make a dramatic return to the present—facing new crises and old enemies. At Matthew’s ancestral home, Sept-Tours, they reunite with the beloved cast of characters from A Discovery of Witches —with one significant exception. But the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency.	561	July 1st 2014	Sarah Bishop, Diana Bishop, Matthew Clairmont, Emily Mather, Miriam Shephard, Hamish Osborne, Marcus Whitmore, Ysabeau de Clermont, Peter Knox, Agatha Wilson, Gallowglass de Clermont, Marthe (Vampire), Philippe de Clermont, Verin de Clermont, Phoebe Taylor, Fernando Gonçalves, Chris Roberts	Oxford, England, Saint Lucien (France), Madison, New York (United States), Limousin (France) New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Limousin (France), New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16054217-the-book-of-life
