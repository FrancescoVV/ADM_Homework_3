The Complete Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Trilogy of Five	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy #1-5	Douglas Adams	4.40	15669	765	On 12 October 1979 the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor (and Earth) was made available to humanity. This was of course The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy. But this was just the beginning. We followed the adventures of hapless protagonist Arthur Dent and his alien side-kick, Ford Prefect, across a trilogy of five books: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. And this merry spacewagon, featuring a flying sofa, a paranoid Android, a gift-wrapped fishbowl, bath towels and much else besides, became an instant classic. Now, for the first time, we are publishing all five books in the Hitchhiker's series, as an ebook omnibus.	1003	January 1st 1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/372299.The_Hitch_Hiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy
