When We Collided		Emery Lord	3.84	18207	2887	We are seventeen and shattered and still dancing. We have messy, throbbing hearts, and we are stronger than anyone could ever know… Jonah never thought a girl like Vivi would come along. Vivi didn’t know Jonah would light up her world. Neither of them expected a summer like this…a summer that would rewrite their futures. In an unflinching story about new love, old wounds, and forces beyond our control, two teens find that when you collide with the right person at just the right time, it will change you forever.	352	April 5th 2016	Vivian Irene Alexander, Jonah Daniels, Leah Daniels, Tony Daniels, Naomi Daniels, Silas Daniels, Bekah Daniels, Isaac Daniels, Carrie Alexander, James Bukowski	Verona Cove, California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663637-when-we-collided
