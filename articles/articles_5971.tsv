Beware of Pity		Stefan Zweig, Phyllis Blewitt, Trevor Blewitt	4.21	9913	1004	The great Austrian writer Stefan Zweig was a master anatomist of the deceitful heart, and Beware of Pity , the only novel he published during his lifetime, uncovers the seed of selfishness within even the finest of feelings. Hofmiller, an Austro-Hungarian cavalry officer stationed at the edge of the empire, is invited to a party at the home of a rich local landowner, a world away from the dreary routine of his barracks. The surroundings are glamorous, wine flows freely, and the exhilarated young Hofmiller asks his host's lovely daughter for a dance, only to discover that sickness has left her painfully crippled. It is a minor blunder, yet one that will go on to destroy his life, as pity and guilt gradually implicate him in a well-meaning but tragically wrongheaded plot to restore the unhappy invalid to health. "Stefan Zweig was a dark and unorthodox artist; it's good to have him back." â€”Salman Rushdie	353	1939	Anton Hofmiller, Edith von Kekesfalva, Doctor Condor, Lajos Kekesfalva	Vienna (Austria)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59149.Beware_of_Pity
