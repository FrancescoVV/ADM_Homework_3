All the Inside Howling	Hollow Folk #2	Gregory Ashe	4.34	354	50	Vie Eliot has survived a new high school, an abusive father, and the murderous Mr. Big Empty. Now, as Vie searches for Mr. Big Empty, he also finds himself facing an unexpected complication: how to be a good boyfriend. When a mysterious drifter named River disappears, though, Vie finds himself dragged into finding the missing boy. Vieâ€™s psychic abilities have proved useful in the past, and once again they set him on the trail of a gruesome murderer. But the pattern of killings seems to make no sense, and as Vie tries to stop the murderer, he learns that the people he loves most are in terrible danger. And the killings may be much more personal than Vie has suspected.	338	February 11th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34233016-all-the-inside-howling
