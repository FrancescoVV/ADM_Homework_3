Finding Freia Lockhart		Aimee Said	3.84	225	17	Freia Lockhart just wants to fit in at school but her best friend Kate is determined to get in with the popular Bs: Belinda, Bethanee and Brianna. Even Freia knows when she hangs out with the Bs she fits in like a turkey in a flock of flamingos. Kate convinces Freia to audition for the school play so they can 'all hang out together' and meet all the cute guys. Predictably, Freia misses out on a chorus role and instead is assigned to production lighting, with rumoured bad boy Daniel. Freia soon learns first impressions aren’t always correct and when Daniel needs a friend, she risks her reputation and place among the Bs to support him. The most surprising development is the group of friends she ends up spending her time with. On opening night there’s not a B in sight.	286	February 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7733054-finding-freia-lockhart
