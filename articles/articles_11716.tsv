Far from You		Lisa Schroeder	4.08	3889	464	Lost and alone...down the rabbit hole. Years have passed since Alice lost her mother to cancer, but time hasn't quite healed the wound. Alice copes the best she can by writing her music, losing herself in her love for her boyfriend, and distancing herself from her father and his new wife. But when a deadly snowstorm traps Alice with her stepmother and newborn half sister, she'll face issues she's been avoiding for too long. As Alice looks to the heavens for guidance, she discovers something wonderful. Perhaps she's not so alone after all....	355	December 18th 2008	Alice Andreeson, Victoria Kitchen, Claire Amadeus, Ivy Madison, Blaze (Far From You)	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4732517-far-from-you
