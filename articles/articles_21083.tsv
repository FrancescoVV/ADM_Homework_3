Ishtar's Odyssey: A Storybook for Advent	Advent Adventures #4	Arnold Ytreeide	4.49	238	46	A new Advent family devotional from the author of Jotham’s Journey! Fourth in a set of Advent adventure books for families, Ishtar’s Odyssey follows the ten-year-old son of a Persian wise man as their caravan follows a star across the desert. Ishtar would just as soon stay in the comfort of the palace, but slowly he learns that there’s much to see, do, and learn in this world that can’t be experienced in school. He eventually meets Jotham, Bartholomew, and Tabitha as he follows his father and uncles in their search for a newborn king.	160	September 27th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25271044-ishtar-s-odyssey
