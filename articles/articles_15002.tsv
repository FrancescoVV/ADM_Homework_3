The Enneads		Plotinus, Stephen MacKenna, John M. Dillon	4.05	2736	56	Plotinus is the last great philosopher of antiquity, although in more than one respect, a precursor of modern times. The Enneads bring together Neoplatonism--mystic passion and ideas from Greek philosophy--together with striking variants of the Trinity and other central Christian doctrines, to produce a highly original synthesis.	688	250			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26252.The_Enneads
