Reaper Man	Discworld #11	Terry Pratchett	4.26	84196	2669	'Death has to happen. That's what bein' alive is all about. You're alive, and then you're dead. It can't just stop happening.' But it can. And it has. So what happens after death is now less of a philosophical question than a question of actual reality. On the Disc, as here, they need Death. If Death doesn't come for you, then what are you supposed to do in the meantime? You can't have the undead wandering about like lost souls. There's no telling what might happen, particularly when they discover that life really is only for the living...	352	May 1991	Cut Me Own Throat Dibbler, DEATH, The Bursar, The Librarian, Auditors of Reality, Renata Flitworth, Windle Poons, Reg Shoe, Death of Rats, Mustrum Ridcully, Senior Wrangler, Lecturer in Recent Runes, Lupine, Ludmilla Cake, Mrs. Cake, Schleppel, Mr. Ixolite, Fred Colon, Dean (Terry Pratchett), Azrael (Terry Pratchett), Arthur Winkings, Doreen Winkings	Discworld, Ankh-Morpork	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34517.Reaper_Man
