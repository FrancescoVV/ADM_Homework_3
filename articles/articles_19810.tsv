Days of the Living Christ (Volume 1)		W. Cleon Skousen	4.50	130	11	Many wonderful and inspirational surprises lie within the covers of this book and its companion, Volume 2. Over Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Skousen had concluded that just about everything connected with the life and mission of Jesus Christ had been written. Then he began to find some scriptural treasures that had been missed. Before long he was deep into a comprehensive study of the life and mission of the Savior that finally culminated in these two volumes. Volume 1 covers the birth of Christ, His early years, the Sermon on the Mount and much of His ministry here on earth. The reader will grasp a new concept of the love Jesus had for the Jewish people and also discover a whole new scriptural basis for Peter's denial of the Christ. It is believed these two volumes will provide a new, dynamic, three-dimensional appreciation of the Savior and those who labored with Him.	470	July 1992		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/805087.Days_of_the_Living_Christ
