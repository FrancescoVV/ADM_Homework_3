Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands		Jorge Amado, Harriet de Onís	4.02	6926	386	It surprises no one that the charming but wayward Vadinho dos Guimaraes–a gambler notorious for never winning—dies during Carnival. His long suffering widow Dona Flor devotes herself to her cooking school and her friends, who urge her to remarry. She is soon drawn to a kind pharmacist who is everything Vadinho was not, and is altogether happy to marry him. But after her wedding she finds herself dreaming about her first husband’s amorous attentions; and one evening Vadinho himself appears by her bed, as lusty as ever, to claim his marital rights.	576	1966	Dona Flor, Vadinho, Teodoro		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147039.Dona_Flor_and_Her_Two_Husbands
