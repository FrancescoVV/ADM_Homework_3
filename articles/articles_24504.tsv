The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb		Gar Alperovitz, Sanho Tree, Peter Dimock	4.01	230	22	Controversial in nature, this book demonstrates that the United States did not need to use the atomic bomb against Japan. Alperovitz criticizes one of the most hotly debated precursory events to the Cold War, an event that was largely responsible for the evolution of post-World War II American politics and culture.	864	July 30th 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208706.The_Decision_to_Use_the_Atomic_Bomb
