Highlander Untamed	MacLeods of Skye Trilogy #1	Monica McCarty	4.09	7970	363	Rory MacLeod is a bold and powerful Highland Chief with only one allegiance–to his clan. He vows revenge against the rival MacDonald clan, though duty demands a handfast marriage to Isabel MacDonald–a bride he does not want and has no intention of keeping. But Rory couldn’t have anticipated the captivating woman who challenges his steely control, and unleashes the untamed passion simmering beneath his fierce exterior. Blessed with incomparable beauty, Isabel MacDonald is prepared to use every means possible–including seduction–to uncover her husband’s most guarded secrets. Instead Rory awakens Isabel’s deepest desires and her sweetest fantasies. Now Isabel has found the happiness she’s always dreamed of with the very man she must betray, and discovers that passion can be far more dangerous than revenge.	382	July 31st 2007	Roderic "Rory" MacLeod, Isabel MacDonald, Margaret MacLeod, The MacDonald of Sleat, Alex MacLeod	Dunscaith Castle, Isle of Skye, Scotland (United Kingdom), Scottish Highlands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215919.Highlander_Untamed
