The Renascent World		Carryn W. Kerr	4.65	17	11	At five years old, Cassidy had outlived almost Earth’s entire population. Now, at sixteen, she’s in a forbidden relationship with an unworthy Earth boy. Cassidy Jones was five years old when her parents escaped Earth with her and her brother. They were safe in Earth’s orbit in the town of Petriville—hovering at the center of an indestructible sphere—when the meteor impacted Earth and killed Cassidy’s grandparents, aunt and cousin. But now, eleven years later, Gina Petri, Petriville’s founder, assigns a mate to each youth. When Cassidy refuses to participate in this forced mating, her dissent places her and her family in Gina’s firing line. This becomes especially pertinent when Cassidy enters a communication pod and meets an alluring hologram. Eric isn’t in Petriville and he insists Gina will murder his people if she discovers their existence, because he is one of Earth’s few survivors. The more Cassidy gets to know Eric, the more she’s drawn to him—and the feeling seems mutual. He has lost so much in his life and her compassion for him runs deep. Despite the intensity of the static electricity when Cassidy and the hologram of Eric touch, she yearns for the day when she will meet him in person. All the questions will be answered when Petriville returns to Earth, and that day is quickly approaching… Reader advisory: This book contains scenes of violence and murder.
