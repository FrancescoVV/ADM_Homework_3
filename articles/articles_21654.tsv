Mutti's War		M.J. Brett	4.17	64	18	Journalism and literature teacher M.J. Brett presents Mutti's War, a historical novel based on the true events in the life of a German mother forced to smuggle her three small boys out of East Prussia when the Russians surrounded it in 1944.

A vivid, unforgettable story of courage and determination.		2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1200976.Mutti_s_War
