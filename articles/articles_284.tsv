Uncle Tom's Cabin		Harriet Beecher Stowe	3.87	198817	7822	The narrative drive of Stowe's classic novel is often overlooked in the heat of the controversies surrounding its anti-slavery sentiments. In fact, it is a compelling adventure story with richly drawn characters and has earned a place in both literary and American history. Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching themeâ€”the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.	438	1851	Uncle Tom, Simon Legree, Topsy, Evangeline St. Claire, Eliza Harris, George Harris, Augustine St. Clare, Ophelia St. Claire, George Shelby, Tom Loker, Cassy (Uncle Tom's Cabin), Aunt Chloe	Kentucky (United States), Louisiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46787.Uncle_Tom_s_Cabin
