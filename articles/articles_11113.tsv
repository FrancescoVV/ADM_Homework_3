Convivium		Andrew E. Maugham	4.21	19	3	"A brilliant tale. Truly a novel of epic proportions. It takes all the known and accepted ideas of Heaven and Hell and throws them out. You''re drawn in from the first chapter, and at the end of the book you''re howling for more." Kathleen Bashaw	552	March 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2416991.Convivium
