Cerulean Sins	Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #11	Laurell K. Hamilton	3.85	48675	888	Cerulean Sins, the eleventh entry in the hugely-popular Anita Blake series, finds everyone’s favorite vampire hunter keeping house and kicking butt. Anita Blake is trying to get her life back to “normal” after a break-up with her werewolf lover. She has settled into a pattern of domesticity, which means that the new man in her life, the leopard shapeshifter Micah, has no problem sharing her with Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of the City. Things are as peaceful as they ever get for someone who raises the dead, when Jean-Claude receives an unexpected and unwelcome visitor: Musette, the very beautiful, very twisted representative of the European Council of Vampires. Anita soon finds herself caught up in a dangerous game of vampire power politics. To add to her troubles, she is asked to consult on a series of brutal killings, which seem to be the work of something un-human. The investigation leads her to Cerulean Sins, a vampire-run establishment that deals in erotic videos, videos that cater to very specific tastes. Anita knows one creature of the night who has such interests — Jean-Claude’s visitor. But if Anita brings Musette down, the repercussions could cost her everything she holds dear. Once a sworn enemy of all monsters, Anita is now the human consort of both Master Vampire Jean Claude and leopard shapeshifter Micah. When a centuries-old vampire hits St. Louis, Anita finds herself needing all the dark forces her passion can muster to save the ones she loves. Anita Blake returns to find hell hath no fury like a vampire scorned.	529	2003	Anita Blake, Dolph Storr, Zerbrowski (Anita Blake series), Jean-Claude (Anita Blake series), Richard Zeeman, Asher (Anita Blake series), Gregory (Anita Blake series), Jason Schuyler, Nathaniel Graison, Damian (Anita Blake series), Micah Callahan, Marmee Noir, Belle Morte, Zane (Anita Blake series), Bradley Bradford, Stephen (Anita Blake series)	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30245.Cerulean_Sins
