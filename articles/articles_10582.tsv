Hotel Kerobokan		Kathryn Bonella	3.88	3818	289	The author has also written Snowing in Bali, Operation Playboy and Schapelle Corby My Story. This book, Hotel Kerobokan, is internationally titled Hotel K. Welcome to Hotel Kerobokan, the ironic nickname for Kerobokan Jail, Bali's most notorious prison, and home to a procession of the infamous and the tragic: the BALI BOMBERS, Gold Coast beautician SCHAPELLE CORBY and the BALI NINE, among many others. In Hotel Kerobokan's filthy and disease-ridden cells, a United Nations of prisoners live crushed together in misery. Petty thieves and small-time drug users share cells with killers, rapists and gangsters. Hardened drug traffickers sleep alongside unlucky tourists, who've seen their holiday turn from paradise to hell over one ecstasy tablet. Hotel Kerobokan reveals the wild 'sex nights' organized by corrupt guards for prisoners who have the money to pay, the rampant drug use, the suicides and killings, and days out at the beach. It exposes the jail's role in supplying high-grade drugs to the outside, the gang that rules the jail through terror, the corruption that means anything is for sale, and the squalor and misery endured by prisoners. Hotel Kerobokan is backed up by hundreds of prisoner interviews, and the truth about this bizarre jail explodes off the page.	308	2009		Bali (Indonesia)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7380006-hotel-kerobokan
