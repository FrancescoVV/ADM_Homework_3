The Sheltering Sky		Paul Bowles	3.91	24593	1741	In this classic work of psychological terror, Paul Bowles examines the ways in which Americans apprehend an alien culture--and the ways in which their incomprehension destroys them. The story of three American travelers adrift in the cities and deserts of North Africa, The Sheltering Sky is at once merciless and heartbreaking in its compassion. It etches the limits of human reason and intelligence--perhaps even the limits of human life --when they touch the unfathomable emptiness and impassive cruelty of the desert.	342	1949	Port Moresbury,, Kit Moresbury	Algeria	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/243598.The_Sheltering_Sky
