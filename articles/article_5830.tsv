Mother Courage and Her Children		Bertolt Brecht, David Hare	3.65	15399	370	Widely considered one of the great dramatic creations of the modern stage, "Mother Courage and Her Children" is Bertolt Brecht's most passionate and profound statement against war. Set in the seventeenth century, the play follows Anna Fierling -- "Mother Courage" -- an itinerant trader, as she pulls her wagon of wares and her children through the blood and carnage of Europe's religious wars. Battered by hardships, brutality, and the degradation and death of her children, she ultimately finds herself alone with the one thing in which she truly believes -- her ramshackle wagon with its tattered flag and freight of boots and brandy. Fitting herself in its harness, the old woman manages, with the last of her strength, to drag it onward to the next battle. In the enduring figure of Mother Courage, Bertolt Brecht has created one of the most extraordinary characters in the literature of drama.	112	April 19th 1941	Anna Fierling, Kattrin Haupt, Eilif, Swiss Cheese, Yvette Pottier, Cook, Chaplain		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85679.Mother_Courage_and_Her_Children
