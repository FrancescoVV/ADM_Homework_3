Web of Lies	Elemental Assassin #2	Jennifer Estep	4.09	21428	1000	Curiosity is definitely going to get me dead one of these days. Probably real soon. I'm Gin Blanco. You might know me as the Spider, the most feared assassin in the South. I’m retired now, but trouble still has a way of finding me. Like the other day when two punks tried to rob my popular barbecue joint, the Pork Pit. Then there was the barrage of gunfire on the restaurant. Only, for once, those kill shots weren’t aimed at me. They were meant for Violet Fox. Ever since I agreed to help Violet and her grandfather protect their property from an evil coalmining tycoon, I’m beginning to wonder if I’m really retired. So is Detective Donovan Caine. The only honest cop in Ashland is having a real hard time reconciling his attraction to me with his Boy Scout mentality. And I can barely keep my hands off his sexy body. What can I say? I’m a Stone elemental with a little Ice magic thrown in, but my heart isn’t made of solid rock. Luckily, Gin Blanco always gets her man . . . dead or alive.	400	May 5th 2010	Gin Blanco, Finnegan Lane, Donovan Caine, Owen Grayson, Jonah McAllister, Mab Monroe, Sophia Deveraux, Eva Grayson, Jolene "Jo-Jo" Deveraux, Roslyn Phillips, Violet Fox, Warren T.
