The Zombie Cause Dictionary		Doc Lucky Meisenheimer	5.00	8	7	Inspired by The Zombie Cause, the world’s first documentary short film series highlighting the must-win battle against zombies, this book will introduce you to Doc Ruger, the world’s most notable authority on zombology. As a prestigious zombologist, Doc Ruger instructs his three sons in zombie behavior and the art of zombie hunting. His boys, Headshot, Silent Blade, and ZB (Zombie Boy)—our country’s teens and ‘tweens—are our nation’s last hope. Either this generation learns of the threat and becomes skilled in zombie hunting, or our great nation will fall to the Horde.	262	October 19th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16100576-the-zombie-cause-dictionary
