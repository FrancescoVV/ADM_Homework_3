Early Dawn	Coulters Historical #3	Catherine Anderson	4.09	2316	148	After breaking off their engagement, Eden Paxton's fiance spreads so many rumors about her that she is forced to leave San Francisco. Her pride bruised, an angry Eden heads for the wilds of Colorado to live with her half brothers. But murderous outlaws cut the trip short when they kidnap her, intending to sell her across the Mexican border. Ever since a gang murdered his wife, Matthew Coulter cannot see a woman being mistreated without vowing to rescue her—and exacting vengeance against the evildoers. So when he spots Eden with the ruffians, Matthew takes fierce, focused action to save her. As Eden and Matthew run for their lives, she recognizes a kind heart beneath Matthew's rugged exterior. But she wonders which will win out: his obsession with revenge—or their growing passion for each other.	417	December 29th 2009	Eden Paxton, Matthew Coulter	Denver, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6627943-early-dawn
