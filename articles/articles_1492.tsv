Suttree		Cormac McCarthy	4.18	17810	1429	This compelling novel has as its protagonist Cornelius Suttree, living alone and in exile in a disintegrating houseboat on the wrong side of the Tennessee River close by Knoxville. He stays at the edge of an outcast community inhabited by eccentrics, criminals and the poverty-stricken. Rising above the physical and human squalor around him, his detachment and wry humour enable him to survive dereliction and destitution with dignity.	471	May 1979	Cornelius Suttree, Gene Harrogate	Knoxville, Tennessee (United States), Tennessee (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394469.Suttree
