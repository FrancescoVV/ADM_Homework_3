Midnight Frost	Mythos Academy #5	Jennifer Estep	4.13	11221	567	Here we go again … Just when it seems life at Mythos Academy can’t get any more dangerous, the Reapers of Chaos manage to prove me wrong. It was just a typical night at the Library of Antiquities — until a Reaper tried to poison me. The good news is I’m still alive and kicking. The bad news is the Reaper poisoned someone else instead. As Nike’s Champion, everyone expects me to lead the charge against the Reapers, even though I’m still hurting over what happened with Spartan warrior Logan Quinn. I’ve got to get my hands on the antidote fast — otherwise, an innocent person will die. But the only known cure is hidden in some creepy ruins — and the Reapers are sure to be waiting for me there …	372	July 30th 2013	Gwen Frost, Daphne Cruz, Logan Quinn, Carson Callahan, Oliver Hector		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15714133-midnight-frost
