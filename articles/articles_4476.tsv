The First Men in the Moon		H.G. Wells, Steven McLean, China Mi√©ville, Patrick Parrinder	3.68	12829	643	When penniless businessman Mr Bedford retreats to the Kent coast to write a play, he meets by chance the brilliant Dr Cavor, an absent-minded scientist on the brink of developing a material that blocks gravity. Cavor soon succeeds in his experiments, only to tell a stunned Bedford the invention makes possible one of the oldest dreams of humanity: a journey to the moon. With Bedford motivated by money, and Cavor by the desire for knowledge, the two embark on the expedition. But neither are prepared for what they find - a world of freezing nights, boiling days and sinister alien life, on which they may be trapped forever.	213	January 1st 1901		Moon	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/536478.The_First_Men_in_the_Moon
