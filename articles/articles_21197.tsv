Born Into Chaos		Lily Lamb	4.30	20	13	Many hundreds of years ago, he was born into a world of chaos. Shunned by the gods and the humans because of his lineage. He lived in isolation, filled with resentment and shame for not fitting in anywhere. As his resentment built, he no longer cared for anyone but living by his own rules that nearly destroyed him. One night, a feeling of wonderment crept into his heart, reaching every cell within his body. Although he beamed from ear to ear, he didn’t know why he felt such elation, until he sensed the gentle, rhythmic beat which would beckon him…giving him the will to wake up from a deep sleep, curiosity in tow, his last chance at reparation for his misdeeds. It will lead to a deceptive fight for his sanity and future. Living has never been more deadly and costly… or fulfilling.	271	August 11th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41128906-born-into-chaos
