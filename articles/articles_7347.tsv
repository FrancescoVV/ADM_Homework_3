Spell Bound	Otherworld #12	Kelley Armstrong	4.22	14161	793	The #1 "New York Times" bestselling author sets the stage for a battle of epic proportions. Savannah Levine is all grown up. As a witch endowed with an array of spells, she is also a force to be reckoned with. As a paranormal investigator she is finally coming into her own. But her last case tore a family apart, and Savannah swore she'd give up her powers to fix the mess she helped create. Someone--or something--must have been listening. Powerless and on the run from witch-hunting assassins, Savannah stumbles upon a gathering storm that threatens the very existence of the Otherworld. The danger is real, and Savannah must somehow join forces with old friends like Elena, Clay, Paige, Lucas, Jaime, and Hope to face their world's greatest threat--and one that just might come from within.	352	January 1st 2011	Elena Michaels, Jaime Vegas, Jeremy Danvers, Clayton Danvers, Savannah Levine, Paige Winterbourne, Lucas Cortez, Hope Adams, Adam Vasic, Cassandra DuCharme, Aaron Darnell, Karl Marsten, Kristof Nast, Sean Nast		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7797032-spell-bound
