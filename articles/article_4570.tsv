Echo	The Soul Seekers #2	Alyson Noel	3.90	6599	484	She inherited a magical destiny—and a mission to stop a powerful family of dark sorcerers. She never expected to fall in love with one of them. There's still so much Daire Santos has to learn about being the last Soul Seeker….and about herself. As her magical training becomes more intense, so does her relationship with Dace. But when she learns that his connection to the evil Richter family goes far deeper than she ever imagined, she begins to question if love really can conquer all. Dace is painfully aware that he wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the Richters' dark magic—and now his brother Cade is determined to use his love for Daire against him. Dace is willing to sacrifice anything to protect the girl he loves —including his own life. But will Daire allow it? And what if defeating Cade costs not only his life, but his soul too?	396	November 1st 2012	Daire Santos, Paloma Santos, Dace Whitefeather, Cade Richter, Chepi Whitefeather, Jennika Lyons		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12439057-echo
