Danny the Champion of the World		Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake	4.08	57720	2589	Danny’s life seems perfect: his home is a gypsy caravan, he’s the youngest car mechanic around, and his best friend is his dad, who never runs out of wonderful stories to tell. And when Danny discovers his father’s secret, he’s off on the adventure of a lifetime. Here’s Roald Dahl’s famous story about a 9-year-old boy, his dad, and a daring and hilarious pheasant-snatching expedition. Just as important, it’s the story of the love between a boy and his father who, in Danny’s own words, is “the most marvelous and exciting father a boy ever had.”	224	1975	Danny, Dad, Mr. Hazell		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6690.Danny_the_Champion_of_the_World
