Twist Me	Twist Me #1	Anna Zaires	4.01	21329	1762	Kidnapped. Taken to a private island. I never thought this could happen to me. I never imagined one chance meeting on the eve of my eighteenth birthday could change my life so completely. Now I belong to him. To Julian. To a man who is as ruthless as he is beautiful—a man whose touch makes me burn. A man whose tenderness I find more devastating than his cruelty. My captor is an enigma. I don’t know who he is or why he took me. There is a darkness inside him—a darkness that scares me even as it draws me in. My name is Nora Leston, and this is my story. ***Note: This is book 1 of a completed trilogy. Keep Me and Hold Me are now available everywhere. No cliffhanger.***	312	February 10th 2014	Nora Leston, Julian Esguerra	Oak Lawn, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31847592-twist-me
