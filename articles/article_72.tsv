The Bell Jar		Sylvia Plath	4.01	594577	23306	The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going underâ€”maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.	294	January 1963	Constantin, Esther Greenwood, Valerie, Marco, Mrs. Greenwood, Buddy Willard, Doctor Nolan, Joan Gilling, Jay Cee, Betsy, Irwin, Doctor Gordon, Philomena Guinea, Mrs. Willard, Lenny Shepherd, Dodo Conway, Eric, Doreen	Boston, Massachusetts (United States), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6514.The_Bell_Jar
