Borderland		Anson Scott	4.52	27	18	When the Cartel violence plaguing Mexico spills across the border and takes the life of Jake Martin’s estranged, money-laundering father, the airline pilot and Navy veteran finds himself back in the town he thought he had left for good. Led by clues from the grave and pursued by a crooked lawyer, his sexy assistant and the DEA, Jake unwittingly embarks on a quest for millions in hidden cash. Destined for the narcos but intended for something much darker than drugs, the money has also attracted the attention of Ricardo “Tuco” Medrano, an American-born, violence-weary Cartel enforcer who is looking for a way out. Unknowingly tied by more than the treasure in the desert, Jake and Tuco are drawn together in a deadly contest that will play itself out in the mountains west of El Paso…	302	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17611261-borderland
