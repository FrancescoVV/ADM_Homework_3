Behind the Moss Curtain, and Other Great Savannah Stories		Murray Silver	3.36	45	9	Ten true stories not found anywhere else in print. There are a few contemporary subjects, but most of the stories are about the good old days when Savannah was run by gangsters and gamblers, a time when the town was known as the "Independent State of Chatham County." Some tragic, some comic, a few ghosts...but all true! The best book ever written about Savannah.	285	December 3rd 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14994305-behind-the-moss-curtain-and-other-great-savannah-stories
