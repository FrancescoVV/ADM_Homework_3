Voss		Patrick White, Robert Macfarlane	3.78	2537	228	WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ROBERT MACFARLANE Set in nineteenth-century Australia, Voss is the story of the secret passion between an explorer and a na√Øve young woman. Although they have met only on a few occasions, Voss and Laura are joined by overwhelming, obsessive feelings for each other. Voss sets out to cross the continent, and as hardships, mutiny and betrayal whittle away his power to endure and to lead, his attachment to Laura gradually increases. Laura, waiting in Sydney, moves through the months of separation as if they were a dream and Voss the only reality.	448	August 10th 1957	Johann Ulrich Voss, Laura Trevelyan	Australia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/411496.Voss
