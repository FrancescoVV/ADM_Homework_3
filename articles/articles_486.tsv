The Republic	Platonis opera #6	Plato, Desmond Lee, Maria Helena da Rocha Pereira, Benjamin Jowett	3.94	171987	3607	Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.	416	-380	Adeimantus, Polemarchus, Cleitophon, Socrates (philosopher)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic
