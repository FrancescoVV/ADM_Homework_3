Valiant	Modern Faerie Tales #2	Holly Black	3.88	34927	1866	When seventeen-year-old Valerie runs away to New York City, she's trying to escape a life that has utterly betrayed her. Sporting a new identity, she takes up with a gang of squatters who live in the city's labyrinthine subway system. But there's something eerily beguiling about Val's new friends. And when one talks Val into tracking down the lair of a mysterious creature with whom they are all involved, Val finds herself torn between her newfound affection for an honorable monster and her fear of what her new friends are becoming.	314	May 31st 2002	Kaye Fierch, Ellen Fierch, Janet Stone, Cornelius Stone, Rath Roiben Rye	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/266607.Valiant
