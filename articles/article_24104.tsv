Four Score	Gypsy Brothers #4	Lili St. Germain	4.25	8399	680	Love and hate aren’t all that different. Two sides of the same coin, the yin and the yang. Once upon a time, Jason Ross loved me. And now that he knows what I’ve done, I see the love and the hate warring within him. I see the way he looks at me. The way he wonders how I could do the things I’ve done. I hear it in the way he begs me to stop, to leave this life and run away with him. But there’s only one way I’m leaving LA. And that’ll be when Dornan and the rest of his sons are dead and buried. Jase might forgive me for what I’ve done. But will he forgive me for the crimes I’m yet to commit?	88	May 24th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21805738-four-score
