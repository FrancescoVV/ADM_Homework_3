Safe House	1-800-Where-R-You #3	Jenny Carroll, Meg Cabot	4.10	11309	225	JESS MASTRIANI was on vacation when Amber went missing. Most people blame Jess for Amber's brutal slaying, but how could Jess -- even with her psychic ability to find anyone, anywhere -- have stopped the cheerleader from turning up dead, without having known she was even missing? When yet another cheerleader disappears, Jess has a chance to redeem herself. If she can just find the girl before it's too late, maybe Jess will finally have a chance to be part of the in crowd. Except that it's starting to look like being in might just get you -- not to mention your loved ones -- killed. So much for popularity.	262	March 1st 2002		Orange County, Indiana (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187809.Safe_House
