Three Dark Crowns	Three Dark Crowns #1	Kendare Blake	3.83	79245	12351	When kingdom come, there will be one. In every generation on the island of Fennbirn, a set of triplets is born—three queens, all equal heirs to the crown and each possessor of a coveted magic. Mirabella is a fierce elemental, able to spark hungry flames or vicious storms at the snap of her fingers. Katharine is a poisoner, one who can ingest the deadliest poisons without so much as a stomachache. Arsinoe, a naturalist, is said to have the ability to bloom the reddest rose and control the fiercest of lions. But becoming the Queen Crowned isn’t solely a matter of royal birth. Each sister has to fight for it. And it’s not just a game of win or lose…it’s life or death. The night the sisters turn sixteen, the battle begins. The last queen standing gets the crown.	403	September 20th 2016	Katharine, Natalia Arron, Genevieve Arron, Giselle, Pietyr Renard, Queen Arsinoe, Juillenne "Jules" Milone, Luke Gillespie, Joseph Sandrin, Queen Mirabella, High Priestess Luca, Miles Westwood, Bree Westwood, Priestess Rho, Elizabeth, Sara Westwood	Fennbirn	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28374007-three-dark-crowns
