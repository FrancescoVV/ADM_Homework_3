Angel Fever	Angel #3	L.A. Weatherly	4.11	5548	425	As half-angel Willow strives to save the world from her parasitic otherworldly kin, romance and tension heat up to a climactic finale. In the devastated remains of the world, millions of people live in "refugee" camps provided by the angels who have all but enslaved humanity. As this angelic stranglehold tightens, Willow and Alex are recruiting and training new Angel Killers while struggling to hold ground on the celestial battlefield. But Willow continues to have feelings for Seb, and her love and resolve are tested as a shattering revelation sends Alex on a separate journey. Now that the final battle versus the angels is about to begin-and the fate of the world hangs in the balance-each of them must face the consequences of their own choices. Will love endure? Will the human race survive?	496	August 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10314229-angel-fever
