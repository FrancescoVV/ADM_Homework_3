Perfect Chaos		Jodi Ellen Malpas	3.85	2513	343	It starts like any other Monday for Ty Christianson. Fifty laps in his pool, a suave suit, a chat with his mum on the way to his office, dodging countless calls from women, and his faithful yet cynical assistant waiting for him with a coffee. Then a meeting with his business partner and life-long friend, Sal, upends everything. Sal’s hired a new assistant without so much as consulting Ty. That’s a cardinal sin in their world, but it’s the least of Ty’s worries. Sal hasn’t just hired a new personal assistant, he’s hired an absolute goddess. And she’s off limits to Ty. Lainey Summer drives Ty crazy with her savage beauty, her effortless sexiness, and her unfathomable veneer. She plays her cards way too close to her chest, and doesn’t that just make her more enticing? Unlucky for Lainey, Ty’s notoriously irresistible. Unlucky for Ty, Lainey can resist him. Or . . . can she? As Ty sets on a mission to break Lainey, an intended conquest becomes a fixation. And in the process, he’s thrown into perfect chaos.	569	February 16th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51449747-perfect-chaos
