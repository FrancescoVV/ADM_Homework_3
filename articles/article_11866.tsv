Ida B. . . and Her Plans to Maximize Fun, Avoid Disaster, and (Possibly) Save the World		Katherine Hannigan	3.88	22621	1818	Ida B. Applewood believes there is never enough time for fun. That's why she's so happy to be homeschooled and to spend every free second outside with the trees and the brook. Then some not-so-great things happen in her world. Ida B has to go back to that Place of Slow but Sure Body-Cramping, Mind-Numbing, Fun-Killing Tortureâ€”school. She feels her heart getting smaller and smaller and hardening into a sharp, black stone. How can things go from righter than right to a million miles beyond wrong? Can Ida B put together a plan to get things back to just-about perfect again?	272	2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207802.Ida_B_and_Her_Plans_to_Maximize_Fun_Avoid_Disaster_and_Possibly_Save_the_World
