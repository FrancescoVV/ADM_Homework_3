Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher	Magic Shop #2	Bruce Coville	4.03	7805	521	If Howard Morton and Freddie the Frog Killer were trying to hold you down so that Mary Lou Hutton could kiss you, you might run as fast as Jeremy Thatcher did the day he stumbled into Mr. Elives' Magic Shop. And if you stumbled into that strange shop, you, too, might be asked to make a choice. What would you buy? The Chinese rings? The Skull of Truth? Or the dragon's egg? And if you did buy the dragon's egg, what would you do when you found out you were supposed to hatch it?	160	April 15th 1991	Jeremy, Tiamat		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/770614.Jeremy_Thatcher_Dragon_Hatcher
