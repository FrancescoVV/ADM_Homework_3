The Helicopter Pilot		Darcy Hoover	4.21	131	4	Far removed from the nine to five existence of normal folk, nomads of the modern age scour the hinterlands and remote corners of our globe in a never-ending quest for resources. Modern day explorers, these hard men endure months away from loved ones, exposed to foreign cultures and exotic dangers, all to scrape out a life, and perhaps find a little adventure. An established career in the First World grows stagnant, an opportunity presents itself, and a timid man ventures abroad. In the unforgiving world of offshore oil exploration in a small African village, Edward tentatively drifts beyond his self-imposed boundaries, and finds himself drawn deeper into an existence he cannot escape. This is Edwardâ€™s struggle with his environment as much as his own nature, and the man he desires to be.	261	February 5th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38371214-the-helicopter-pilot
