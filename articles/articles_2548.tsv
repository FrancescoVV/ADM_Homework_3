Fatherland		Robert   Harris	3.99	37305	2097	It is twenty years after Nazi Germany's triumphant victory in World War II and the entire country is preparing for the grand celebration of the Führer's seventy-fifth birthday, as well as the imminent peacemaking visit from President Kennedy. Meanwhile, Berlin Detective Xavier March -- a disillusioned but talented investigation of a corpse washed up on the shore of a lake. When a dead man turns out to be a high-ranking Nazi commander, the Gestapo orders March off the case immediately. Suddenly other unrelated deaths are anything but routine. Now obsessed by the case, March teams up with a beautiful, young American journalist and starts asking questions...dangerous questions. What they uncover is a terrifying and long-concealed conspiracy of such astonding and mind-numbing terror that is it certain to spell the end of the Third Reich -- if they can live long enough to tell the world about it.	380	1991	Xavier March, Max Jaeger, Charlotte Maguire, Hermann Jost, Odilo Globocnik, Wilhelm Stuckart, Pili March, Karl Krebs, Artur Nebe, Rudolf Halder, Henry Nightingale, Josef Bühler	Germany, Berlin (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56842.Fatherland
