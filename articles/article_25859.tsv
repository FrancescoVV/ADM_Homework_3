As the couple’s relationship continues to deteriorate and it seems things can’t get any worse, Tyler suddenly finds himself embroiled in the brutal murder of a young woman who works at the newly-acquired real estate company of Samantha Jessup—the tough-minded, take-no-prisoners business woman who grew up the hard way. In the midst of Tyler’s investigation, he is hit with yet another bombshell when he accidentally runs into Laura Kinkaid one chilly autumn day. The secret that he learns will turn his world upside down. In the meantime, Jenny Tyler gets some surprises of her own when the man she had so passionately loved long ago, the man she had committed her life to, the man who had then mysteriously vanished from her life—Tripp Castleberry—suddenly reappears at her doorstep, declaring his steadfast love for her and stirring emotions that lay buried in her heart. Torn between her commitment to a failing marriage and her renewed feelings for her old love, her first love, Jenny spirals toward despair and destruction. When a second woman is found murdered—her body also mutilated almost beyond recognition—the terror-stricken people of Blacklick Valley wonder which of them might be the psychotic madman’s next victim. Will Tyler learn the identity of the serial killer that threatens Blacklick Valley and uncover the dark secret that drives his insanity? Will Jenny Tyler succumb to the obsessive passion of the mysterious and elusive Tripp Castleberry and her own secret longings? Will Laura Kinkaid’s secret destroy the Tyler marriage or bring resolution? So many secrets—Deadly Secrets….	276	March 16th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29541455-deadly-secrets
