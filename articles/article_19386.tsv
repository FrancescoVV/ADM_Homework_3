Song for the Unraveling of the World		Brian Evenson	3.90	1363	221	A newborn's absent face appears on the back of someone else's head, a filmmaker goes to gruesome lengths to achieve the silence he's after for his final scene, and a therapist begins, impossibly, to appear in a troubled patient's room late at night. In these stories of doubt, delusion, and paranoia, no belief, no claim to objectivity, is immune to the distortions of human perception. Here, self-deception is a means of justifying our most inhuman impulses--whether we know it or not.	240	June 11th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41888678-song-for-the-unraveling-of-the-world
