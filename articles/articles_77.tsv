My Sister's Keeper		Jodi Picoult	4.08	1059666	33533	Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. A provocative novel that raises some important ethical issues, My Sister's Keeper is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning parable for all time.	423	April 6th 2004	Anna Fitzgerald, Sara Fitzgerald, Kate Fitzgerald, Brian Fitzgerald, Jesse Fitzgerald, Campbell Alexander, Julia Romana	United States of America, Providence, Rhode Island (United States), Rhode Island (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10917.My_Sister_s_Keeper
