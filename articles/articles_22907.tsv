INFALLIBLE BOOK 4: THE COMMITMENT FORGOTTEN		T.J. Spencer Jacques	4.30	10	4	Erica passed the infamous Cake Test and for over a year Uncle Glenn has tried to convince Telly to settle down, but it is too late. The clock has struck twelve. The chickens have come home to roost. The reaping season has begun. During the wedding reception for Rasta & Kayla, the Madden Brotherhood is jolted by a new reality that has left Uncle Glenn mortified. Erica is his daughter, Derinda is her mother, and Diana is not sticking around for what she feels is inevitable.Diana isn’t the only wife who is on edge.Briana is also freaking out at the thought that she is married to one of the men her husband wrote about, and so, she threatens him. “Jarvis, if I detect any of the behavior in your book, our marriage is over that day.” It’s too bad Jarvis didn’t heed her warning. What started out as braggadocios entertainment at the expense of innocent women in Book One, has taken a serious plunge in Book Four. This latest installment of Infallible is a continuation of the same brutally honest perspectives with one major difference: Women Are Gamers Too. http://www.TJnovels.com	414	March 3rd 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44286428-infallible-book-4
