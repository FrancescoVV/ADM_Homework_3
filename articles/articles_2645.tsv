The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism		Naomi Klein	4.23	39088	2824	In her ground-breaking reporting from Iraq, Naomi Klein exposed how the trauma of invasion was being exploited to remake the country in the interest of foreign corporations. She called it "disaster capitalism." Covering Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami, and New Orleans post-Katrina, she witnessed something remarkably similar. People still reeling from catastrophe were being hit again, this time with economic "shock treatment" losing their land and homes to rapid-fire corporate makeovers. The Shock Doctrine retells the story of the most dominant ideology of our time, Milton Friedman's free market economic revolution. In contrast to the popular myth of this movement's peaceful global victory, Klein shows how it has exploited moments of shock and extreme violence in order to implement its economic policies in so many parts of the world from Latin America and Eastern Europe to South Africa, Russia, and Iraq. At the core of disaster capitalism is the use of cataclysmic events to advance radical privatization combined with the privatization of the disaster response itself. By capitalizing on crises, created by nature or war, Klein argues that the disaster capitalism complex now exists as a booming new economy, and is the violent culmination of a radical economic project that has been incubating for fifty years.	558	September 18th 2006	Augusto Pinochet, Milton Friedman, Ewen Cameron, Margaret Thatcher, Lech Wałęsa, Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Lenin, Mikhail Gorbachev, Hajji Suharto, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Jeffrey Sachs	New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), Chile, Argentina, Uruguay Bolivia Brazil United Kingdom Indonesia Russia South Africa Iraq Sri Lanka, Uruguay, Bolivia, Brazil, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Iraq, Sri Lanka	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1237300.The_Shock_Doctrine
