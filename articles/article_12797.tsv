The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr Norris/Goodbye to Berlin	The Berlin Novels  #1-2	Christopher Isherwood	4.03	10652	558	A classic of 20th-century fiction, The Berlin Stories inspired the Broadway musical and Oscar-winning film Cabaret . First published in the 1930s, The Berlin Stories contains two astonishing related novels, The Last of Mr. Norris and Goodbye to Berlin , which are recognized today as classics of modern fiction. Isherwood magnificently captures 1931 Berlin: charming, with its avenues and cafÃ©s; marvelously grotesque, with its nightlife and dreamers; dangerous, with its vice and intrigue; powerful and seedy, with its mobs and millionairesâ€”this is the period when Hitler was beginning his move to power. The Berlin Stories is inhabited by a wealth of characters: the unforgettable Sally Bowles, whose misadventures in the demimonde were popularized on the American stage and screen by Julie Harris in I Am A Camera and Liza Minnelli in Cabaret ; Mr. Norris, the improbable old debauchee mysteriously caught between the Nazis and the Communists; plump FrÃ¤ulein Schroeder, who thinks an operation to reduce the scale of her BÃ¼ste might relieve her heart palpitations; and the distinguished and doomed Jewish family, the Landauers.	401	1945		Germany, Berlin (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16810.The_Berlin_Stories
