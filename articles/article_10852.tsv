Judges: When The Light Lay Still	Judges #3	Charles J. Eskew, Charlie J. Eskew	2.94	31	6	UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 2038 A.D. Ezekiel Jones was a cop, and proud of it—until his partner shot a kid and covered it up. Ezekiel testified against her, but the inquiry went nowhere, leaving everything he’d believed in ruins. He joined the new Judges programme the next day. Moulded and shaped to be the first of the new breed of law-makers, Jones hits the streets again. But as a new weapon gets into the hands of radicals and the tension rises, both Jones and those he serves have to decide where their loyalties lie.	137	February 13th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43599898-judges
