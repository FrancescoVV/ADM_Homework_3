Three, Two, One [321]		J.A. Huss	4.13	10743	1822	ONE GIRL Battered, barefoot, and huddled under a bookstore awning in the pouring rain, Blue only knows one thing. After fifteen months of captivity, finally… she is free. TWO FRIENDS Self-made millionaires JD and Ark are not out to save anyone when they stumble upon a wet and shivering girl one early Sunday morning. But when you sell sex for a living and salvation rings your bell… you answer the call. THREE SOULMATES After years of searching, love lifts the veil of darkness, and three people—with three very big secrets—find themselves bound together in a relationship that defies the odds. Or does it? Love. Lust. Sex. This trinity might be perfection… but not everything should come in 3’s. WARNING: This is a STANDALONE non-traditional M/F/M ROMANCE with a non-traditional ending.	365	January 27th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24235463-three-two-one-321
