The Story of My Life		Helen Keller	4.07	132916	2530	When she was 19 months old, Helen Keller (1880â€“1968) suffered a severe illness that left her blind and deaf. Not long after, she also became mute. Her tenacious struggle to overcome these handicaps-with the help of her inspired teacher, Anne Sullivan-is one of the great stories of human courage and dedication. In this classic autobiography, first published in 1903, Miss Keller recounts the first 22 years of her life, including the magical moment at the water pump when, recognizing the connection between the word "water" and the cold liquid flowing over her hand, she realized that objects had names. Subsequent experiences were equally noteworthy: her joy at eventually learning to speak, her friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edward Everett Hale and other notables, her education at Radcliffe (from which she graduated cum laude), and-underlying all-her extraordinary relationship with Miss Sullivan, who showed a remarkable genius for communicating with her eager and quick-to-learn pupil.	240	1902	Anne Sullivan, Helen Keller	Tuscumbia, Alabama (United States), Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Alabama (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821611.The_Story_of_My_Life
