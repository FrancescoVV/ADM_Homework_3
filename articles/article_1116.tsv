Beautiful Darkness	Beautiful Creatures #2	Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl	3.83	125101	7027	Fall under the spell of the Beautiful Darkness , the sequel to the instant NYT bestselling gothic fantasy, Beautiful Creatures! There were no surprises in Gatlin County. At least, that's what I thought. Turns out, I couldn't have been more wrong. Ethan Wate used to think of Gatlin as a place where nothing ever changed. Then mysterious newcomer Lena Duchannes revealed a secret world of curses and Supernaturals with terrifying abilities. Lena showed him a Gatlin where impossible, magical, life-altering events happen. Sometimes life-ending. And now that Ethan's eyes have been opened to the darker side of Gatlin, there's no going back. Haunted by strange visions only he can see, Ethan is pulled deeper into his town's tangled history and finds himself caught up in the dangerous network of underground passageways endlessly crisscrossing the South, where nothing is as it seems.	503	October 12th 2010	Ethan Wate, Lena Duchannes, Wesley "Link" Lincoln, Amma Treadeau, Macon Ravenwood, Ridley Duchannes	Gatlin, South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7842288-beautiful-darkness
