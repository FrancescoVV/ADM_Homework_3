Calico	Covenant of Shadows #2	Kade Cook	4.50	28	14	After surviving a near fatal kidnapping, Gabrian is determined to pick up the sordid pieces of her life or at least she is trying to. But somewhere in the chaos something has gone awry. Her ability to turn off the cravings is broken—leaving her victim to a body meant to run on instinct for survival, a body constructed to reap fear within the Realm. Now Gabrian must test the strength of her will—harness in the unrelenting urge to feed in order to secure her Elders trust or risk becoming the monster that lurks within.	409	November 15th 2017		Bar Harbor, Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36559024-calico
