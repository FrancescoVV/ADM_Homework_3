The Happy Isles of Oceania: Paddling the Pacific		Paul Theroux	4.00	5593	294	Renowned travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux has been many places in his life and tried almost everything. But this trip in and around the lands of the Pacific may be his boldest, most fascinating yet. From New Zealand's rain forests, to crocodile-infested New Guinea, over isolated atolls, through dirty harbors, daring weather and coastlines, he travels by Kayak wherever the winds take him--and what he discovers is the world to explore and try to understand.	528	1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130514.The_Happy_Isles_of_Oceania
