Love Lost Her Way		Julie Anne Addicott	4.52	125	62	From the outside, my life was picture perfect. On the inside, something sinister lurked. I thought he was sick. I thought I could fix him. All I wanted was for him to love me. I was used and abused. Sold to the highest bidder. Unloved. Unseen. Unheard. Until Declan. He was my saviour. He helped me believe in the power of unconditional love. Then, he was gone. When love is lost, and thereâ€™s no hope left, how do you go on? **This is not a romance novel, nor is it a sweet story about love. It is a tragedy and includes themes that may be triggering to some readers. Love Lost Her Way is recommended for ages 18 and over.** Trystan's story, My Name is Tryst, is available now!		2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44669612-love-lost-her-way
