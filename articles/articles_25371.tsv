Run!		Patricia Wentworth	3.84	245	33	Lost on a foggy country road, James enters an old, dark house to get help—but finds trouble. First comes a frightened woman, urging him to flee. Next, someone starts shooting at them. Later, Miss Aspidistra Aspinall says she is after her late aunt’s diamonds, and “ruthless relations” are after her. James is rattled. If Aspidistra knows the assailant, why does she refuse to call the police? Suspicion mounts when James runs into Aspidistra again, at his cousin Daphne’s of all places! Only now “Aspidistra” is Sally. And now James’ associate, Jackson, has been mistaken for James...and murdered. James wants answers. Who is Sally? What was she really doing in the house? And why, for all the fibs and danger, is he in love with her? James means to find out, even if it’s the death of him.	220	1938			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1856004.Run_
