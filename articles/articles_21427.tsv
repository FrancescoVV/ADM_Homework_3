Everyday A**holes: Drawings By Dean Blake		Dean Blake	4.89	9	7	Everyday Assholes by Dean Blake - for the first time in print! Inspired by our favourite everyday a**holes, this first collection of over 160 irreverent sketches by Dean Blake contain some of his earliest (and most popular) online works. Spanning over two years of the author’s career, Everyday A***holes introduces us to a cast of characters we’re only too familiar with. Meet Helen, who literally has an a**hole for a boyfriend. And Mr Nigel, who was unfortunately cursed with a generic pedo face. And let’s not forget Carla, who annoyingly forgot to spit in her husband’s coffee again. Laugh, cry, grit your teeth, run away—whatever you choose to do, know that this book was destined to be in your hands. Or, at the very least, a present for that friend of yours who needs to chill out and secretly chuckle once in a while. WARNING: This book is not for the easily offended.	188	March 20th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53033618-everyday-a-holes
