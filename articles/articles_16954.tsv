The Way I See It...		Randy Petsch	3.83	6	2	The Way I See It is a refreshing new look at American society. The author depicts its progression over the past 100 years, into this chaotic time we now find ourselves. But, this is a point of view with an interesting twist: an exploration of select governmental and social decisions of the century that significantly changed the way Americans live. These pages take you on a journey from the advent of the automobile, to the election of the first black President of the United States, suggesting how those events—and everything in between—helped to shape, and perhaps destroy, the greatest country in the world	244	April 15th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12006931-the-way-i-see-it
