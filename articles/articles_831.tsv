84, Charing Cross Road		Helene Hanff	4.16	46916	6740	This charming classic, first published in 1970, brings together twenty years of correspondence between Helene Hanff, a freelance writer living in New York City, and a used-book dealer in London. Through the years, though never meeting and separated both geographically and culturally, they share a winsome, sentimental friendship based on their common love for books. Their relationship, captured so acutely in these letters, is one that will grab your heart and not let go.	97	January 1st 1970	Frank Doel, Helene Hanff		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368916.84_Charing_Cross_Road
