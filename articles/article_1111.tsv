Anne of the Island	Anne of Green Gables #3	L.M. Montgomery	4.22	135697	4020	New adventures lie ahead as Anne Shirley packs her bags, waves good-bye to childhood, and heads for Redmond College. With her old friend Prissy Grant waiting in the bustling city of Kingsport and her frivolous new friend Philippa Gordon at her side, Anne tucks her memories of rural Avonlea away and discovers life on her own terms, filled with surprises . . . including a marriage proposal from the worst fellow imaginable, the sale of her very first story, and a tragedy that teaches her a painful lesson. But tears turn to laughter when Anne and her friends move into an old cottage and an ornery black cat steals her heart. Little does Anne know that handsome Gilbert Blythe wants to win her heart, too. Suddenly Anne must decide whether she's ready for love.	243	1915	Diana Barry, Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, Marilla Cuthbert, Charlie Sloane, Roy Gardner, Priscilla Grant, Stella Maynard, Philippa Gordon, Davy Keith, Dora Keith, Rachel Lynde, Billy Andrews, Jane Andrews, Ruby Gillis	Prince Edward Island (Canada), Nova Scotia (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77392.Anne_of_the_Island
