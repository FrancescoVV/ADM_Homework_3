When Christ and His Saints Slept	Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine #1	Sharon Kay Penman	4.23	14504	821	A.D. 1135. As church bells tolled for the death of England's King Henry I, his barons faced the unwelcome prospect of being ruled by a woman: Henry's beautiful daughter Maude, Countess of Anjou. But before Maude could claim her throne, her cousin Stephen seized it. In their long and bitter struggle, all of England bled and burned. Sharon Kay Penman's magnificent fifth novel summons to life a spectacular medieval tragedy whose unfolding breaks the heart even as it prepares the way for splendors to comeâ€”the glorious age of Eleanor of Aquitaine and the Plantagenets that would soon illumine the world.	784	January 1st 1994	Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry II of England, Stephen of England, Empress Matilda, Brien FitzCount, Adeliza of Louvain, Geoffrey of Anjou, Robert Fitzroy, 1st Earl of Gloucester, Louis VII of France	England, France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43841.When_Christ_and_His_Saints_Slept
