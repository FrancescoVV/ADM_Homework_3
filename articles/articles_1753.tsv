Spells	Wings #2	Aprilynne Pike	3.98	39210	2027	"I can't just storm in and proclaim my intentions. I can't 'steal' you away. I just have to wait and hope that, someday, you'll ask," Tamani said. "And if I don't?" Laurel said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Then I guess I'll be waiting forever." Although Laurel has come to accept her true identity as a faerie, she refuses to turn her back on her human life - and especially her boyfriend, David - to return to the faerie world. But when she is summoned to Avalon, Laurel's feelings for the charismatic faerie sentry Tamani are undeniable. She is forced to make a choice - a choice that could break her heart.	359	July 23rd 2009	Laurel Sewell, David Lawson, Tamani	Crescent City, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6801582-spells
