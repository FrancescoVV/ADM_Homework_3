4:50 from Paddington	Miss Marple #8	Agatha Christie	3.96	44501	2285	For an instant the two trains ran together, side by side. In that frozen moment, Elspeth witnessed a murder. Helplessly, she stared out of her carriage window as a man remorselessly tightened his grip around a womanâ€™s throat. The body crumpled. Then the other train drew away. But who, apart from Miss Marple, would take her story seriously? After all, there were no suspects, no other witnesses... and no corpse.	288	November 4th 1957	Lucy Eyelesbarrow, Elspeth McGillicuddy, Luther Crackenthorpe, Cedric Crackenthorpe, Harold Crackenthorpe, Alfred Crackenthorpe, Emma Crackenthorpe, Bryan Eastley, Alexander Eastley, Dr. Quimper, Dermot Craddock, Miss Marple, Frank Cornish, Edmund Crackenthorpe, Martine Dubois, Mrs. Kidder, James Stoddart-West, Dr. Morris (4:50 from Paddington), Mr. Wimborne, Anna Stravinska, Madame Joilet, Armand Dessin, Inspector Bacon	Brackhampton (United Kingdom), St. Mary Mead, England (United Kingdom), Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140278.4
