A Constant Heart	Against All Expectations #1	Siri Mitchell	3.44	2114	215	What Is the Cost of Love and Beauty? Marget Barnardsen has always been fortunate. She was born with the face of an angel. Her father is a knight, and a small fortune has been lavished upon her. And now she is to be married to an earl. Her security is fixed, her destiny guaranteed. At least, she hopes. The Earl of Lytham has already been married once. But the beautiful woman only left him with a broken heart and the bitter taste of betrayal. Now, his only demand of Marget is that she help him win favor with the Queen. But when Marget's introduction to court is met with the jealous queen's wrath, the young bride fears she's lost her husband forever. Desperate to honor him, she'll risk everything by doing whatever it takes to recapture the heart of a man bound to the Queen in a world where love is the only forbidden luxury.	384	October 1st 2008	Lady De Winter, Earl of Lytham, Marget, Countess of Lytham, Elizabeth I of England	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2873007-a-constant-heart
