Unravel Me	Breathless #2	Lynn Montagano	4.02	105	21	Lia’s meant to be on cloud nine: ever since she and Alastair finally confessed their love for one another, their relationship has never been so good. Her British-born Adonis is all intent on sweeping her off her feet, showering her with gifts and affection more than worthy of the girlfriend of an international, millionaire businessman! But their past seems to be intent on dragging the both of them down, and the hushed gossip of a dark secret begins to cause havoc to Lia’s life… With an ocean separating her from her love, Lia can’t help but wonder if she can ever feel secure with a man who still plays everything so close to his chest, including her.	254	July 17th 2014		Glasgow, Scotland, Orlando, Florida (United States), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22587134-unravel-me
