Al Capone Does My Shirts	Tales from Alcatraz #1	Gennifer Choldenko	3.84	40963	3974	Today I moved to a twelve-acre rock covered with cement, topped with bird turd and surrounded by water. I'm not the only kid who lives here. There's my sister, Natalie, except she doesn't count. And there are twenty-three other kids who live on the island because their dads work as guards or cook's or doctors or electricians for the prison, like my dad does. Plus, there are a ton of murderers, rapists, hit men, con men, stickup men, embezzlers, connivers, burglars, kidnappers and maybe even an innocent man or two, though I doubt it. The convicts we have are the kind other prisons don't want. I never knew prisons could be picky, but I guess they can. You get to Alcatraz by being the worst of the worst. Unless you're me. I came here because my mother said I had to.	225	January 1st 2004	Al Capone	Alcatraz Island, San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89716.Al_Capone_Does_My_Shirts
