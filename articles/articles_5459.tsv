Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter		Simone de Beauvoir, James Kirkup	4.14	9796	758	A superb autobiography by one of the great literary figures of the twentieth century, Simone de Beauvoir's Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter offers an intimate picture of growing up in a bourgeois French family, rebelling as an adolescent against the conventional expectations of her class, and striking out on her own with an intellectual and existential ambition exceedingly rare in a young woman in the 1920s. She vividly evokes her friendships, love interests, mentors, and the early days of the most important relationship of her life, with fellow student Jean-Paul Sartre, against the backdrop of a turbulent time in France politically.	359	January 1st 1958		Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164006.Memoirs_of_a_Dutiful_Daughter
