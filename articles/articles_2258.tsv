Going Bovine		Libba Bray	3.65	32308	3925	Can Cameron find what he’s looking for? All 16-year-old Cameron wants is to get through high school—and life in general—with a minimum of effort. It’s not a lot to ask. But that’s before he’s given some bad news: he’s sick and he’s going to die. Which totally sucks. Hope arrives in the winged form of Dulcie, a loopy punk angel/possible hallucination with a bad sugar habit. She tells Cam there is a cure—if he’s willing to go in search of it. With the help of a death-obsessed, video-gaming dwarf and a yard gnome, Cam sets off on the mother of all road trips through a twisted America into the heart of what matters most.	480	September 22nd 2009	Dulcie, Balder, Cameron Smith, Jena Smith, Paul Ignacio “Gonzo” Gonzales		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6512140-going-bovine
