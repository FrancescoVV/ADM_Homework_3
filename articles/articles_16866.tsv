An Angel from Hell: Real Life on the Front Lines		Ryan A. Conklin	4.11	135	15	An edgy, gripping report from the front lines by a young veteran and cast member of The Real World: Brooklyn Ryan Conklin enlisted in the Army at age seventeen, following 9/11, and joined Angel Company. As a turret gunner with the famed 101st Airborne "Screaming Eagles," and a member of the famed "Rakkasans" regiment-the most decorated regiment in the U.S. Army-he endured hellish conditions in the war-torn city of Tikrit, Iraq. When he returned to the States, he became a cast member on The Real World: Brooklyn in 2008. That came to an end when he received his notice recalling him to duty. An Angel from Hell is a gritty, blunt, and laugh­out-loud funny war memoir from the grunt's perspective. Conklin reveals what the Iraq war is really like, day to day-the misery, the boredom, the absurdity, the horror, and even the moments of grace. With stunning candor and wisdom beyond his years, Ryan Conklin has documented a complex and unavoidably life-changing experience for his generation.	400	April 6th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7135797-an-angel-from-hell
