Or is she going out of her mind? With a stalker, threats, and attempted break-ins, Kate’s troubles multiply. Then there’s her enigmatic neighbour, the brooding Tom Carbis; a man with secrets he doesn’t wish to share. Can she trust him when he says he wants to help? In her quest to unravel the mysteries surrounding her, will Kate uncover more than she bargains for?
