The Two Towers	The Lord of the Rings #2	J.R.R. Tolkien, Peter S. Beagle	4.44	724142	10831	The Fellowship was scattered. Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor–the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in The Return of the King.	322	November 11th 1954	Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Boromir, Bilbo Baggins, Eriol, Rúmil, Treebeard, Saruman, Éowyn, Éomer, Elrond Half-elven, Arwen Undómiel, Galadriel, Faramir, Gollum, Legolas, Sam Gamgee	Middle-earth	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222910.The_Two_Towers
