Dead of Night	Dead of Night #1	Jonathan Maberry	3.97	6173	525	A prison doctor injects a condemned serial killer with a formula designed to keep his consciousness awake while his body rots in the grave. But all drugs have unforeseen side-effects. Before he could be buried, the killer wakes up. Hungry. Infected. Contagious. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang…but a bite.	358	October 25th 2011	Lee Hartnup		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10779721-dead-of-night
