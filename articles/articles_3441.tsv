Nostromo		Joseph Conrad	3.82	15354	642	A gripping tale of capitalist exploitation and rebellion, set amid the mist-shrouded mountains of a fictional South American republic, employs flashbacks and glimpses of the future to depict the lure of silver and its effects on men. Conrad's deeply moral consciousness and masterful narrative technique are at their best in this, one of his finest works.	336	1904	Giorgio Viola, Gian' Battista Fidanza, Charles Gould, Don Jose Avellanos, Mr. Holroyd, Martin Decoud	Costaguana, South America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115476.Nostromo
