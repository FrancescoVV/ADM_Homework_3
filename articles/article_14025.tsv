Tangle of Need	Psy-Changeling #11	Nalini Singh	4.09	20058	1421	Adria, wolf changeling and resilient soldier, has made a break with the past—one as unpredictable in love as it was in war. Now comes a new territory, and a devastating new complication: Riaz, a SnowDancer lieutenant already sworn to a desperate woman who belongs to another. For Riaz, the primal attraction he feels for Adria is a staggering betrayal. For Adria, his dangerous lone-wolf appeal is beyond sexual. It consumes her. It terrifies her. It threatens to undermine everything she has built of her new life. But fighting their wild compulsion toward one another proves a losing battle. Their coming together is an inferno…and a melding of two wounded souls who promise each other no commitment, no ties, no bonds. Only pleasure. Too late, they realize that they have more to lose than they ever imagined. Drawn into a cataclysmic Psy war that may alter the fate of the world itself, they must make a decision that might just break them both.	422	May 29th 2012	Judd Lauren, Mercy Smith, Riley Aedan Kincaid, Hawke Snow, Indigo Riviere, Riaz Delgado, Adria Morgan, Walker Lauren, Aden Kai, Sienna Lauren, Vasic, Kaleb Krycheck		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12059093-tangle-of-need
