Another Broken Wing, Flap Flap		James Sumner Kendrick	4.50	2	1	A young guy ignores a barrage of coincidences in his life until an almost impossible fluke involving a Powerball lottery drawing opens up a pathway for him to discover why his mother vanished when he was born … and why the peculiar truth about the rest of his family has been so well hidden. This is a story about synchronicity -- which illustrates that coincidences are not random… but instead … meaningful arrangements.
