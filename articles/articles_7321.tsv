Shattered Glass	Shattered Glass #1	Dani Alexander	4.08	8811	1261	A male prostitute, a mangy cat, a murder and a maniacal mix-up that threatens his career, his impending marriage and his life. Nothing is going as planned for Austin Glass. Austin—seems to have it all. At least on the surface. A loving fiancee. A future with the FBI and a healthy sized trust fund. He also has a grin and a wisecrack for every situation. But the smile he presents to everyone hides a painful past he’s buried too deeply to remember. And his quips mask bitterness and insecurity. Austin has himself and most of the whole world fooled. Until he meets someone who immediately sees him better than he sees himself. As events unfold and Austin’s world unravels, he finds himself pushed into making quick life-changing decisions. But can he trust Peter or what’s happening between them when each meeting seems to be just a series of volatile reactions?	360	January 31st 2012	Austin Glass, Peter "Rabbit" Dyachenko, Nikolaj Strakosha, Darryl Boerner, Luis Martinez, Dave Buchanan	Denver, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13420351-shattered-glass
