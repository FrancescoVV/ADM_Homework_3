Demonglass	Hex Hall #2	Rachel Hawkins, R. Khokins	4.10	88795	4835	Sophie Mercer thought she was a witch. That was the whole reason she was sent to Hex Hall, a reform school for delinquent Prodigium (a.k.a. witches, shape-shifters, and faeries). But then she discovered the family secret, and the fact that her hot crush, Archer Cross, is an agent for The Eye, a group bent on wiping Prodigium off the face of the earth. Turns out, Sophie's a demon, one of only two in the world-the other being her father. What's worse, she has powers that threaten the lives of everyone she loves. Which is precisely why Sophie decides she must go to London for the Removal, a dangerous procedure that will either destroy her powers for good-or kill her. But once Sophie arrives, she makes a shocking discovery. Her new housemates? They're demons too. Meaning, someone is raising demons in secret, with creepy plans to use their powers, and probably not for good. Meanwhile, The Eye is set on hunting Sophie down, and they're using Archer to do it. But it's not like she has feelings for him anymore. Does she?	359	March 22nd 2011	Jenna, Nick, Sophia Mercer, Archer Cross, Elodie, Mrs. Casnoff, Alexander Callahan (Cal), James Atherton, Lara Casnoff, Daisy	England, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8428064-demonglass
