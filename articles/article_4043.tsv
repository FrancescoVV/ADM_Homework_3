The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror	Pine Cove #3	Christopher Moore	3.82	40355	3141	'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit. But not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead. But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. ( Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say "Kris Kringle," he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen. Move over, Charles Dickensâ€”it's Christopher Moore time.	306	October 1st 2004	Lena Marquez, Dale Pearson, Theophilus (Theo) Crowe, Molly Michon, Tucker Case, Gabe Fenton, Valerie Riordan, Archangel Raziel, Joshua Kindler, Roberto the fruitbat from Guam		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74731.The_Stupidest_Angel
