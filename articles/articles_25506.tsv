The Having of Wonderful Ideas: And Other Essays on Teaching and Learning		Eleanor Duckworth	4.16	152	19	Eleanor Duckworth's ideas contained in these timeless essays are more important than ever to the public discourse on education. While touching on many subjects--from science, math, and poetry to learning, teaching, thinking, evaluation, and teacher education--each of these essays supports the author's deeply felt belief that "the having of wonderful ideas is the essence of intellectual development." The revised Third Edition of this indispensable classic on Piaget and teaching features a new introduction, a new chapter on critical exploration in the classroom, and a renewed belief in the need to educate children about peace and social justice. Praise for Previous Editions!
