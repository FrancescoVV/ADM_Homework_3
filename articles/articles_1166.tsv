An Echo in the Bone	Outlander #7	Diana Gabaldon	4.44	118460	6234	A new Outlander novel — the seventh — from #1 National Bestselling author Diana Gabaldon. Readers have been waiting with bated breath for the seventh volume in bestselling author Diana Gabaldon’s epic Outlander saga — a masterpiece of historical fiction featuring Jamie and Claire, from one of the genre’s most popular and beloved authors. Jamie Fraser, erstwhile Jacobite and reluctant rebel, knows three things about the American rebellion: the Americans will win, unlikely as that seems in 1778; being on the winning side is no guarantee of survival; and he’d rather die than face his illegitimate son — a young lieutenant in the British Army — across the barrel of a gun. Fraser’s time-travelling wife, Claire, also knows a couple of things: that the Americans will win, but that the ultimate price of victory is a mystery. What she does believe is that the price won’t include Jamie’s life or happiness — not if she has anything to say. Claire’s grown daughter Brianna, and her husband, Roger, watch the unfolding of Brianna’s parents’ history — a past that may be sneaking up behind their own family.	1149	September 22nd 2009	Jamie Fraser, Brianna Randall, Roger MacKenzie, Jeremiah MacKenzie, Fergus Fraser, Marsali Fraser, Germain Fraser, Ian Murray, Tom Christie, Lord John Grey, Benedict Arnold, Claire Randall Fraser, Jenny Murray, Young Ian Murray, William Ransom, Rachel Hunter, Denzell Hunter, William Buccleigh MacKenzie, Amanda MacKenzie, Lizzie Wemyss, Jo Beardsley, Kezzie Beardsley, Laoghaire MacKenzie, Joan MacKimmie, Michael Murray	Fraser's Ridge, North Carolina (United States), Saratoga, New York (United States), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States), Wilmington, North Carolina , 1776 (United States) Lallybroch, Scotland , 1980 (United Kingdom) Lallybroch, Scotland , 1777 (United Kingdom), Wilmington, North Carolina (United States), Lallybroch, Scotland (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2832909-an-echo-in-the-bone
