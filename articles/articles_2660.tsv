The Hostile Hospital	A Series of Unfortunate Events #8	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	3.97	98042	2593	There is nothing to be found in the pages of these books but misery and despair. You still have time to choose something else to read. But if you must know what unpleasantries befall the charming and clever Baudelaire children read on...The Hostile Hospital - There are many pleasant things to read about, but this book contains none of them. Within its pages are such burdensome details as a suspicious shopkeeper, unnecessary surgery, heartshaped balloons, and some very starling news about a fire. Clearly you do not want to read about such things.	272	September 4th 2001	Count Olaf, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Violet Baudelaire, Esm√© Squalor, Geraldine Julienne	Last Chance General Store, Heimlich Hospital	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65118.The_Hostile_Hospital
