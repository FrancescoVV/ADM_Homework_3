"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character	Feynman #1	Richard P. Feynman	4.27	158229	5868	A New York Times bestseller—the outrageous exploits of one of this century's greatest scientific minds and a legendary American original. Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures. Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums; painting a naked female toreador. In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric—a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.	400	1985	Richard Feynman		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35167685-surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman
