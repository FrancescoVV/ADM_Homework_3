Lover at Last	Black Dagger Brotherhood #11	J.R. Ward	4.30	62645	6082	Qhuinn, son of no one, is used to being on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has finally found an identity as one of the most brutal fighters in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems to be within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another.... Blay, after years of unrequited love, has moved on from his feelings for Qhuinn. And it’s about time: it seems Qhuinn has found his perfect match in a Chosen female, and they are going to have a young. It’s hard for Blay to see the new couple together, but building your life around a pipe dream is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. And Qhuinn needs to come to terms with some dark things before he can move forward… Fate seems to have taken these vampire soldiers in different directions... but as the battle over the race’s throne intensifies, and new players on the scene in Caldwell create mortal danger for the Brotherhood, Qhuinn finally learns the true definition of courage, and two hearts who are meant to be together... finally become one.	608	March 26th 2013	Qhuinn, Blaylock, Xcor, Saxton, Layla (Chosen) (Black Dagger), Marisol (Sola) Morte, Trez, iAm, Wrath (Blind King), Assail, son of Assail	Caldwell, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13570854-lover-at-last
