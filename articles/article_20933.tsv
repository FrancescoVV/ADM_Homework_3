A Date with the Devil		Kira Adams	4.31	145	87	The Monster. In one moment, my entire life was ripped away from me. I ignored the warning signs until it was too late. Until I became the victim. He took my life away from me; my freedom, my courage. I've lived my life in debilitating fear since that fateful day. The Savior. He was there the day it all went down, and he's been by my side ever since. He's been the only thing that's kept me going. He's my best friend, but he wants more. I'm terrified to lose him. I'm terrified he'll leave. One tried to kill me. One brought me back to life. I'll never be the same person again--that girl died when the match was dropped. Too much has already been stolen from me. It's time to take back what's mine.		May 31st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25192041-a-date-with-the-devil
