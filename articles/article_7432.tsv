The Voyage Out		Virginia Woolf	3.75	9096	676	Woolf’s first novel is a haunting book, full of light and shadow. It takes Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose and their niece, Rachel, on a sea voyage from London to a resort on the South American coast. “It is a strange, tragic, inspired book whose scene is a South America not found on any map and reached by a boat which would not float on any sea, an America whose spiritual boundaries touch Xanadu and Atlantis” (E. M. Forster).	375	1915	Clarissa Dalloway, Rachel Vinrace, Helen Ambrose, Ridley Ambrose, Richard Dalloway, Terence Hewet	South America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148905.The_Voyage_Out
