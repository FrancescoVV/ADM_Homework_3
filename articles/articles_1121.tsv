A Man Called Ove		Fredrik Backman, Henning Koch	4.35	574835	65579	A grumpy yet loveable man finds his solitary world turned on its head when a boisterous young family moves in next door. Meet Ove. He's a curmudgeon, the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him the bitter neighbor from hell , but must Ove be bitter just because he doesn't walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents' association to their very foundations.	337	August 27th 2012	Ove, Parvaneh, Sonja, Rune, Adrian, Mirsad, Jimmy, Anita, Patrick, Anders, Lena, Nanasin	Sweden	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove
