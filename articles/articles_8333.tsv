The trouble seems linked to the mysterious disappearance of Mozag and John Dart, who have spent their lives policing the magical community. When Nate and his friends are asked to help investigate, they discover they discover kids feverishly playing arcade games in an effort to win enough tickets to redeem one of four stamps: jets, tanks, submarines and racecars. Rumour has it that the stamps are definitely worth it. But what do they do? The kids soon discover that the owner of Arcadeland is recruiting members for four different clubs. When each club is filled, he will begin his quest to retrieve a magical talisman of almost unimaginable power. With John Dart and Mozag sidelined, will Nate, Summer, Trevor, Pigeon and their new friend, Lindy, find a way to save the day?	433	October 12th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13624316-arcade-catastrophe
