Retrieving for All Occasions		Elsa Blomster, Lena Gunnarsson, Emelie Johnson Vegh, Jenny Nyberg, Johanna Simonsson	4.22	273	6	Do you have a gun dog and want to have a great time working with your dog and perhaps enter a field trial? Do you want to find a training method where your dog has just as much fun as you do? Do you want to learn how to combine clicker training and field trial training? If so, this is the book for you. Retrieving for All Occasions could have been called "Retrieving for Fun and Function", referring to the fact that this way of training dogs works for fun and activation on your everyday walks or when you want to raise your ambitions to competitions and field trials. This accessible and inspiring book describes an approach to gun dog training that uses the clicker training philosophy and method in your gun dog training. With over 100 exercises to train for introductory field trial work for spaniels and retrievers this book is also useful for good all-around obedience and teamwork training for all sporting dog breeds as well as a fun activity to do with any companion pet dog.	256	January 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29421058-retrieving-for-all-occasions
