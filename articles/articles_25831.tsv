Birthday		Meredith Russo	4.25	7211	1722	Meet Eric and Morgan. Born on the same day, at the same time, in the same place. They’ve always shared this one day together, but as they grow up they begin to grow apart. Everyone expects Eric to get a football scholarship, but no one knows he’s having second thoughts. Former quarterback Morgan feels utterly alone, as she wrestles with the difficult choice to live as her true self. Both of them are struggling to be the person they know they are. Who better to help than your best friend? Told on one day every year, over six years, this is a story about how change pulls people apart… and how love brings them back together. An LGBTQ+ YA One Day perfect for fans of Love, Simon, Birthday is a beautiful love story by the best-selling #ownvoices author of If I Was Your Girl.	300	May 21st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863399-birthday
