Tales of a Female Nomad: Living at Large in the World		Rita Golden Gelman	3.85	14320	1349	“I move throughout the world without a plan, guided by instinct, connecting through trust, and constantly watching for serendipitous opportunities. ” —From the Preface Tales of a Female Nomad is the story of Rita Golden Gelman, an ordinary woman who is living an extraordinary existence. At the age of forty-eight, on the verge of a divorce, Rita left an elegant life in L.A. to follow her dream of connecting with people in cultures all over the world. In 1986 she sold her possessions and became a nomad, living in a Zapotec village in Mexico, sleeping with sea lions on the Galapagos Islands, and residing everywhere from thatched huts to regal palaces. She has observed orangutans in the rain forest of Borneo, visited trance healers and dens of black magic, and cooked with women on fires all over the world. Rita’s example encourages us all to dust off our dreams and rediscover the joy, the exuberance, and the hidden spirit that so many of us bury when we become adults.	312	May 22nd 2001		Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Israel Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) Indonesia Canada New Zealand Thailand, Israel, Galápagos Islands (Ecuador), Indonesia, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85622.Tales_of_a_Female_Nomad
