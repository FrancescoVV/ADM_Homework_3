Wolf Hall	Thomas Cromwell #1	Hilary Mantel	3.87	167906	15792	Tudor England. Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is charged with securing his divorce. Into this atmosphere of distrust comes Thomas Cromwell - a man as ruthlessly ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages.	672	April 30th 2009	Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour, Mary Boleyn, Thomas Howard, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Thomas Wyatt, Hans Holbein the Younger, Francis I of France, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer, Walter Cromwell, Morgan Williams, Elizabeth Wykys, Henry Wykys, Johane Williamson, John Williamson, Alice Wellyfed, Bet Cromwell, Rafe Sadler, Thomas Avery, Helen Barre, Dick Purser, Thomas Wolsey, George Cavendish, Stephen Gardiner, Katherine Cromwell, Thomas Boleyn, Henry VIII of England, George Boleyn, Jane Boleyn, Richard Riche, Mary I of England	Putney (United Kingdom), Dover, Kent, England (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom), England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7826803-wolf-hall
