Succubus Revealed	Georgina Kincaid #6	Richelle Mead	4.26	20735	1675	In Georgina Kincaid, succubus and she-demon, #1 New York Times bestselling author Richelle Mead has created one of her most enticing characters. But with a shot at love, and maybe even redemption, is the ultimate seductress finally going soft? Like hell she is. . . Georgina Kincaid has had an eternity to figure out the opposite sex, but sometimes they still surprise her. Take Seth Mortensen. The man has risked his soul to become Georgina's boyfriend. Still, with Lucifer for a boss, Georgina can't just hang up her killer heels and settle down to domestic bliss. In fact, she's being forced to transfer operations. . .to Las Vegas. The City of Sin is a dream gig for a succubus, but Georgina's allies are suspicious. Why are the powers-that-be so eager to get her away from Seattle and from Seth? Georgina is one of Hell's most valuable assets, but if there's any way out of the succubus business she plans to take it, no matter how much roadkill she leaves behind. She just hopes the casualties won't include the one man she's risking everything for. . .	277	August 30th 2011	Georgina Kincaid, Jerome, Doug Sato, Cody, Seth Mortensen, Hugh Mitchell, Carter, Roman Smith, Bastien Moreau, Peter Gwel	Seattle, Washington (United States), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7802254-succubus-revealed
