The Keep	Adversary Cycle #1	F. Paul Wilson	3.99	17245	671	"Something is murdering my men." Thus reads the message received from a Nazi commander stationed in a small castle high in the remote Transylvanian Alps. And when an elite SS extermination squad is dispatched to solve the problem, the men find a something that's both powerful and terrifying. Invisible and silent, the enemy selects one victim per night, leaving the bloodless and mutilated corpses behind to terrify its future victims. Panicked, the Nazis bring in a local expert on folklore―who just happens to be Jewish―to shed some light on the mysterious happenings. And unbeknownst to anyone, there is another visitor on his way―a man who awoke from a nightmare and immediately set out to meet his destiny. The battle has begun: On one side, the ultimate evil created by man, and on the other...the unthinkable, unstoppable, unknowing terror that man has inevitably awakened.	403	1981	Glaeken, Major Erik Kaempffer, Captain Klaus Woermann, Professor Theodor Cuza, Magda Cuza, Rasalom	Dinu Pass, Romanian Alps (Romania)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62571.The_Keep
