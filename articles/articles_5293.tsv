The Cantos		Ezra Pound	3.93	5125	129	Delmore Schwartz said about The Cantos , "They are one of the touchstones of modern poetry." William Carlos Williams said, "[Pound] discloses history by its odor, by the feel of itâ€”in the words; fuses it with the words, present and past, to MAKE his Cantos . Make them." Since the 1969 revised edition, the Italian Cantos LXXII and LXXIII (as well as a 1966 fragment concluding the work) have been added. Now appearing for the first time is Pound's recently found English translation of Italian Canto LXXII.	824	1970			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/269589.The_Cantos
