Eleanor Rigby		Douglas Coupland	3.65	9626	458	Eleanor Rigby is the story of Liz, a self-described drab, overweight, crabby, and friendless middle-aged woman, and her unlikely reunion with the charming and strange son she gave up for adoption. His arrival changes everything, and sets in motion a rapid-fire plot with all the twists and turns we expect of Coupland. By turns funny and heartbreaking, Eleanor Rigby is a fast-paced read and a haunting exploration of the ways in which loneliness affects us all.	272	January 1st 2004	Jeremy, Liz Dunn	Canada	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10008.Eleanor_Rigby
