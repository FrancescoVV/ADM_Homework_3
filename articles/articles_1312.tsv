The Last Wish	The Witcher #0.5	Andrzej Sapkowski, Danusia Stok	4.13	194265	13226	Geralt the Witcher—revered and hated—is a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent. But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good... and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.	360	January 31st 1993	Dandelion, Yennefer, Geralt of Rivia, Nenneke		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603587-the-last-wish
