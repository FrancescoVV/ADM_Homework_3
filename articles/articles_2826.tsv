Ninth Key	The Mediator #2	Jenny Carroll, Meg Cabot	4.06	37342	1053	Ghosts ruin everything. Especially your love life. Everything is going great for Suze. Her new life in California is a whirlwind of parties and excellent hair days. Tad Beaumont, the hottest boy in town, has even asked Suze out on her very first date. Suze is so excited that she's willing to ignore her misgivings about Tad... particularly the fact that he's not Jesse, whose ghostly status - not to mention apparent disinterest in her - make him unattainable. What Suze can't ignore, however, is the ghost of a murdered woman whose death seems directly connected to dark secrets hidden in none other than Tad Beaumont's past.	287	January 30th 2001	Susannah "Suze" Simon, Hector de Silva (Jesse), Father Dominic, CeeCee Webb, Tad Beaumont, Andy Ackerman, Jake Ackerman (Sleepy), Brad Ackerman (Dopey), David Ackerman (Doc)	Carmel-by-the-Sea, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199786.Ninth_Key
