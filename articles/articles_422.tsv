Infinite Jest		David Foster Wallace	4.28	74546	8941	A gargantuan, mind-altering tragi-comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America. Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us humanâ€”and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.	1088	February 1st 1996	Hal Incadenza, Joelle Van Dyne, Michael Pemulis, Mario Incandenza, Ken Erdedy, Avril Incandenza, Orin Incandenza, Randy Lenz, Ortho Stice, Tiny Ewell, Poor Tony Krause, Clenette Henderson, Remy Marathe, Hugh Steeply, Pat Montesian, Ann Kittenplan, Trevor Axford, LaMont Chu, Geoffrey Day, Gerhardt Schtitt, Ted Schacht, Dr. James Orin Incandenza, Katherine Ann Gompert, Dr. Charles Tavis, Mildred L.
