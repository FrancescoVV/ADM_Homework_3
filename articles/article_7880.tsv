Davita's Harp		Chaim Potok	4.00	5649	395	For Davita Chandal, growing up in the New York of the 1930s and '40s is an experience of joy and sadness. Her loving parents, both fervent radicals, fill her with the fiercely bright hope of a new and better world. But as the deprivations of war and depression take a ruthless toll, Davita unexpectedly turns to the Jewish faith that her mother had long ago abandoned, finding there both a solace for her questioning inner pain and a test of her budding spirit of independence.	371	1985		New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14769.Davita_s_Harp
