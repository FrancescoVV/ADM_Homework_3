The Secret Lives of People - Real Diary Excerpts from Modern Day America		L.M. Hughes	3.08	12	0	This book is an anonymous collection of real diary entries, with true personal stories about life. Have you ever wondered what makes people tick? Or if youâ€™re normal? This book is full of genuine dear diary entries where women talk about their innermost thoughts - they confess what it feels like to have an affair, experiment with cutting, lose their virginity, participate in group sex, have an abortion, struggle with mental illness, or lose a friend to suicide. These are the sometimes funny, sometimes sad, real life private experiences that expose The Secret Lives of People. This is the best holiday travel read for 2014. Think of the book like a weird cross between The Diary of Anne Frank, Go Ask Alice, and 50 Shades of Grey. Book is NOT suitable for minors.	246	January 31st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20679880-the-secret-lives-of-people---real-diary-excerpts-from-modern-day-america
