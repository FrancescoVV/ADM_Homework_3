Far From You		Tess Sharpe	4.02	11554	1420	Nine months. Two weeks. Six days. That's how long recovering addict Sophie's been drug-free. Four months ago her best friend, Mina, died in what everyone believes was a drug deal gone wrong - a deal they think Sophie set up. Only Sophie knows the truth. She and Mina shared a secret, but there was no drug deal. Mina was deliberately murdered. Forced into rehab for an addiction she'd already beaten, Sophie's finally out and on the trail of the killerâ€”but can she track them down before they come for her?	341	March 27th 2014	Sophie Winters, Mina Bishop, Trev Bishop	Northern California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20517739-far-from-you
