Waiting for Normal		Leslie Connor	4.04	11242	1360	This poignant and joyful novel is filled with meaningful moments and emotional resonance. Addie is waiting for normal. But Addie's mother has an all-or-nothing approach to life: a food fiesta or an empty pantry, her way or no way. Addieâ€™s mother is bipolar, and she often neglects Addie. All-or-nothing never adds up to normal, and it can't bring Addie home, where she wants to be with her half-sisters and her stepfather. But Addie never stops hoping that one day, maybe, she'll find normal.	290	February 5th 2008		New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2210839.Waiting_for_Normal
