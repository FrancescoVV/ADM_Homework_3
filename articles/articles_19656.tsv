After the Storm	Heartland #2	Lauren Brooke	4.11	3587	124	Heartland is a horse farm nestled in the hills of Virginia, but it's much more than that. Heartland is like no other place - it's a place where the scars of the past can be healed, a place where frightened and abused horses learn to trust again. Amy hasn't seen Spartan since the accident - that stormy night that changed their lives forever. Now Spartan is coming to Heartland. He's not the same horse. He's filled with an anger that seems directed at Amy. At the sight of her, he lashes out - teeth bared, hooves flailing. Amy has so much healing to do on her own, it seems she's the last person who could help Spartan. But she might also be the only one.	171	June 2000	Amy Fleming, Jack Bartlett, Lou Fleming, Ty Baldwin, Matt Trewin, Scott Trewin, Val Grant, Carl Anderson, Larry Boswell, Max Satchwell, Nancy Satchwell, Melanie Satchwell, Hannah Boswell, Shelley Boswell, Ashley Grant		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/904965.After_the_Storm
