Thunder of Heaven	Martyr's Song #3	Ted Dekker	4.16	3390	100	Experience one of the first novels from New York Times bestselling author Ted Dekker. “[ Heaven’s Wager is] genuinely exciting . . . fast paced . . . spine-tingling . . .” — Publishers Weekly The world's worst fears have dawned. Nothing stands in the way of total destruction . . . except the love of one woman. Deep in the Amazon jungle a young American woman and the son of plantation owners fall madly in love. For Tanya and Shannon, life is a paradise most only dream about. But today paradise ends. The jungle has hatched more than idyllic love. It has also spawned insidious evil. An evil shrouded in a plot so diabolically brilliant that all of America will be brought to its knees at the hands of a few terrorists. The plan is executed to perfection. There is no way out . . . save an ancient woman whose dark past has lead her to a life of prayer in preparation for the unspeakable terror coming unleashed. “Well, well, guess what I’ve found. A fiction writer with a rare knack for a compelling story, an expansive reservoir of clever ideas, and a unique dry wit that makes me laugh.” —Frank Peretti, New York Times bestselling author “Rarely does a novel grip a reader’s heart and soul the way Heaven’s Wager does. Dekker is among a very small number of writers who have mastered the challenge of blending sound theology with knock-your-socks-off storytelling.” —Robert Liparulo, novelist and contributing editor of New Man magazine	304	January 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/456058.Thunder_of_Heaven
