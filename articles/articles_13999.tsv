Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis	The Vampire Chronicles #12	Anne Rice	3.80	7058	928	At the novel's center: the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, hero, leader, inspirer, irresistible force, irrepressible spirit, battling (and ultimately reconciling with) a strange otherworldly form that has somehow taken possession of Lestat's undead body and soul. This ancient and mysterious power and unearthly spirit of vampire lore has all the force, history, and insidious reach of the unknowable Universe. It is through this spirit, previously considered benign for thousands of vampire years and throughout the Vampire Chronicles, that we come to be told the hypnotic tale of a great sea power of ancient times; a mysterious heaven on earth situated on a boundless continent--and of how and why, and in what manner and with what far-reaching purpose, this force came to build and rule the great legendary empire of centuries ago that thrived in the Atlantic Ocean. And as we learn of the mighty, far-reaching powers and perfections of this lost kingdom of Atalantaya, the lost realms of Atlantis, we come to understand its secrets, and how and why the vampire Lestat, indeed all the vampires, must reckon so many millennia later with the terrifying force of this ageless, all-powerful Atalantaya spirit.	451	November 29th 2016	Lestat de Lioncourt, Gabrielle de Lioncourt, Marius de Romanus, David Talbot, Bianca Solderini, Louis de Pointe du Lac, Rhoshamandes, Benji Mahmoud, Amel, Dr. Fareed Bhansali, Derek, Kapetria, Arion, Dertu, Welf, Welfu, Katu, Magnus, Garekyn Zweck Brovotkin, Eleni, Allesandra, Benedict, Cyril, Gregory Duff Collingsworth, Gremt Stryker Knollys, Killer, Sevraine, Sybelle, Thorne, Armand, Pandora, Seth (VC)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23267873-prince-lestat-and-the-realms-of-atlantis
