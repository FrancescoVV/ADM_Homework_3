The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared	The Hundred-Year-Old Man #1	Jonas Jonasson	3.82	215527	22919	After a long and eventful life, Allan Karlsson ends up in a nursing home, believing it to be his last stop. The only problem is that he’s still in good health. A big celebration is in the works for his 100th birthday, but Allan really isn’t interested (and he’d like a bit more control over his alcohol consumption), so he decides to escape. He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey. It would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: he has not only witnessed some of the most important events of the 20th century, but actually played a key role in them. Quirky and utterly unique, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has charmed readers across the world.	396	September 9th 2009	Allan Karlsson, Julius Jonsson, Benny Ljungberg, Gunilla Björklund, Per-Gunnar Gerdin, Herbert Einstein, Amanda Einstein, Göran Aronsson	Malmköping (Sweden), Los Alamos, New Mexico (United States), Washington, D.C.
