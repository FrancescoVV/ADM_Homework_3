Riddley Walker		Russell Hoban	4.02	7022	812	In the far distant future, the country laid waste by nuclear holocaust, twelve-year-old Riddley Walker tells his story in a language as fractured as the world in which he lives. As Riddley steps outside the confines of his small world, he finds himself caught up in intrigue and a frantic quest for power, desperately trying to make sense of things.	256	1980		Canterbury, Kent, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776573.Riddley_Walker
