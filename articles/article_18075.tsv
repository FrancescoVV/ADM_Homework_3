The Technological Bluff		Jacques Ellul	3.91	54	5	The author argues that "an easily distracted consumer society is caught up in a rapidly developing, uncontrollable technological system . . . . Every problem generates a technological solution; computers breed ever larger, more fragile, and vulnerable systems. But the solutions raise more and greater problems than they solve . . . . Responsibility, contemplation, civility, and spirituality suffer." (Choice)	434	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/274830.The_Technological_Bluff
