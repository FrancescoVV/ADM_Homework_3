Travels with My Aunt	 	Graham Greene, Gloria Emerson	3.82	11094	927	Henry Pulling, a retired bank manager, meets his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta for the first time in over fifty years at what he supposes to be his mother's funeral. Soon after, she persuades Henry to abandon Southwood, his dahlias and the Major next door to travel her way, Brighton, Paris, Istanbul, Paraguay. Through Aunt Augusta, a veteran of Europe's hotel bedrooms, Henry joins a shiftless, twilight society: mixing with hippies, war criminals, CIA men; smoking pot, breaking all the currency regulations and eventually coming alive after a dull suburban life. In Travels with my Aunt Graham Greene not only gives us intoxicating entertainment but also confronts us with some of the most perplexing of human dilemmas.	254	1969	Henry Pulling, Aunt Augusta Bertman, Ercole Viscontin, Zachary Wordsworth	London, England (United Kingdom), Istanbul (Turkey), Paraguay, Brighton, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48858.Travels_with_My_Aunt
