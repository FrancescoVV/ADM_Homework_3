A Country Doctor's Notebook		Mikhail Bulgakov, Михаил Булгаков	4.28	13839	981	Brilliant stories that show the growth of a novelist's mind, and the raw material that fed the wild surrealism of Bulgakov's later fiction. With the ink still wet on his diploma, the twenty-five-year-old Dr. Mikhail Bulgakov was flung into the depths of freezing rural Russia which, in 1916-17, was still largely unaffected by such novelties as the motor car, the telephone or electric light. How his alter-ego copes (or fails to cope) with the new and often appalling responsibilities of a lone doctor in a vast country practice — on the eve of Revolution — is described in Bulgakov's delightful blend of candid realism and imaginative exuberance.	158	1925		Mourievo (Russian Federation)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/897363.A_Country_Doctor_s_Notebook
