Year of the Dogman		Frank Holes Jr.	4.12	26	6	The action of Year of the Dogman by Frank Holes, Jr. centers around the weird sightings and dark introductions that occur every year in the deep woods of the Northern Midwest. In an extravagant science fiction horror, the author deconstructs the pulse of the natural world between man and mystery when an unidentified mysterious beast-animal haunts the small village of Twin Lakes, Michigan. An ethereal and menacing message shakes the foundation between the unexplained and the supernatural when a spirit is awakened from an old Indian legend. The Dogman, said to be part canine, part man, has traced its ancient stolen treasure to an unsuspecting young school teacher named Steve Nolan, who doesn't know the family heirloom he wears around his neck calls out to the creature. In a story that is both wildly original and boldly penned, this novel delivers a fast-paced, frenetic ride into the wild world of cryptozoology.	230	July 23rd 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1919382.Year_of_the_Dogman
