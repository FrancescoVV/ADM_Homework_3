Watermelon	Walsh Family #1	Marian Keyes	3.78	73373	1784	Claire has everything she ever wanted: a husband she adores, a great apartment, a good job. Then, on the day she gives birth to their first baby, James informs her that he's leaving her. Claire is left with a newborn daughter, a broken heart, and a postpartum body that she can hardly bear to look at. She decides to go home to Dublin. And there, sheltered by the love of a quirky family, she gets better. So much so, in fact, that when James slithers back into her life, he's in for a bit of a surprise.	520	September 1995	Adam, Claire Webster (nee Walsh), Anna Walsh, Helen Walsh, James Webster, Kate Walsh	Dublin (Ireland)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9300.Watermelon
