Bonds of Justice	Psy-Changeling #8	Nalini Singh	4.05	20421	1085	Max Shannon is a good cop, one of the best in New York Enforcement. Born with a natural shield that protects him against Psy mental invasions, he knows he has little chance of advancement within the Psy-dominated power structure. The last case he expects to be assigned is that of a murderer targeting a Psy Councilor’s closest advisors. And the last woman he expects to compel him in the most sensual of ways is a Psy on the verge of a catastrophic mental fracture… Sophia Russo is a Justice-Psy, cursed with the ability to retrieve memories from men and women so twisted even veteran cops keep their distance. Appointed as Max’s liaison with the Psy, she finds herself fascinated by this human, her frozen heart threatening to thaw with forbidden emotion. But, her mind filled with other people’s nightmares, other people’s evil, she’s standing on the border between sanity and a silken darkness that urges her to take justice into her own hands, to become judge, jury…and executioner…	348	July 6th 2010	Sascha Duncan, Lucas Hunter, Faith Nightstar, Clay Bennett, Talin McKade, Dorian Christensen, Sophia Russo, Nikita Duncan, Max Shannon, Kaleb Krycheck, Vaughn D'Angelo, Anthony Kyriakus	San Francisco, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7044445-bonds-of-justice
