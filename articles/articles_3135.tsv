The Penderwicks: A Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy	The Penderwicks #1	Jeanne Birdsall	4.15	48053	5114	The Penderwick sisters busily discover the summertime magic of Arundel estate’s sprawling gardens, treasure-filled attic, tame rabbits, and the cook who makes the best gingerbread in Massachusetts. Best of all is Jeffrey Tifton, son of Arundel’s owner, the perfect companion for their adventures. Icy-hearted Mrs. Tifton is less pleased with the Penderwicks than Jeffrey, and warns the new friends to stay out of trouble. Is that any fun? For sure the summer will be unforgettable.	262	June 14th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/266904.The_Penderwicks
