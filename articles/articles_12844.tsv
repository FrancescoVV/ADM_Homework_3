The Off-Beat Cinder Ella: who wants her shoe back...without the Prince (upside-down fairy tales Book 1)		Anne Murray, T.K. Diem Nguyen	4.67	6	6	I'm not sure what your Cinderella looks like, but THIS Cinder Ella wears camo pants, flannel shirts and dragon's tooth earrings. She climbs trees straight to the top, rides horses without a saddle and shoots arrows with abandon--and not much skill. Toiling all day to do her stepmother's bidding, she doesn't have much of a life except for the occasional shenanigans that she can devise. No one notices Cinder Ella. She shuffles around, trying to blend into the background. Would her life ever get better? Or would she always be smudged with cinders and eating the leftovers? Wasn't there any magic for her?
