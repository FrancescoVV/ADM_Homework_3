The Tale of Peter Rabbit	The World of Beatrix Potter: Peter Rabbit	Beatrix Potter	4.18	208302	2074	In this original edition, Peter and his sisters are told to go gather blackberries and not to go into MacGregor's garden because Peter's father was made into a pie by MacGregor after being found in the garden. Peter, who is wearing a new coat, promptly disobeys his mother, stuffs himself with vegetables, gets spotted by MacGregor, loses his coat and barely makes it out of the garden alive. When Peter gets home, he is given chamomile tea for dinner. Peter's sisters, who listened to their mother and stayed out of the forbidden garden have a regular dinner.	72	December 16th 1901	Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit, Flopsy Rabbit, Mopsy Rabbit, Cotton-tail Rabbit, Mrs. Rabbit, Mr. McGregor	Lake District, Cumbria, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19321.The_Tale_of_Peter_Rabbit
