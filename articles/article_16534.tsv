Tender Buttons		Gertrude Stein	3.73	5558	403	Before becoming the patron of Lost Generation artists, Gertrude Stein established her reputation as an innovative author whose style was closer to painting than literature. Stein's strong influence on 20th-century literature is evident in this 1915 work of highly original prose rendered in thought-provoking experimental techniques.	96	1914	Melanctha, Lena Kaligaris, Anna (Gertrude Stein)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/778310.Tender_Buttons
