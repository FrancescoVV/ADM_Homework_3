Nira/Sussa	Nira/Sussa #1	Julian Darius	3.76	110	20	He's a tenured creative writing professor. A well-respected novelist. And a recovering sadistic pervert with a penchant for young girls. His name is Julian Darius, which by great coincidence just happens to be the name of this novel's author. She's a teenage groupie who insists he buy her a collar before they have sex. She seems to know his desires better than he does. And she wants to fulfill them - even ones he claims not to have. The result is a strange love story that explores how far we'd really go, given the opportunity... and whether men and women could truly live together, if they were completely honest about their desires. This erotic and violent novel, criticized as pornographic, is nonetheless supremely literary and won its author a Ph.D. in English. WARNING: SEXUAL CONTENT, VIOLENCE, TRANSGRESSIVE THEMES, INTELLIGENCE. From Martian Lit.
