Always You	Best Friend #1	Kirsty Moseley	3.92	20226	1234	Clay Preston is the most desirable guy in school, and boy does he know it! Movie star looks paired with a quarterback’s body, he’s every girl’s dream guy–but not mine. To me, he’s simply my best friend, the one who has been there as far back as I can remember. Our relationship has always been easy, playful and affectionate, but after one lost bet, and one payment in the form of a kiss, the dynamic of everything changes… Note: Always You is book one in the Best Friend series; however, it is a standalone novel with a complete ending.	329	October 31st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16301111-always-you
