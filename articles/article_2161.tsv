The Austere Academy	A Series of Unfortunate Events #5	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	3.98	133912	3811	Dear Reader, If you are looking for a story about cheerful youngsters spending a jolly time at boarding school, look elsewhere. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent and resourceful children, and you might expect that they would do very well at school. Don't. For the Baudelaires, school turns out to be another miserable episode in their unlucky lives. Truth be told, within the chapters that make up this dreadful story, the children will face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E., and the metric system. It is my solemn duty to stay up all night researching and writing the history of these three hapless youngsters, but you may be more comfortable getting a good night's sleep. In that case, you should probably choose some other book. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket	221	August 8th 2000	Count Olaf, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Arthur Poe, Duncan Quagmire, Isadora Quagmire, Violet Baudelaire, Carmelita Spats, Vice Principal Nero, Mr. Remora, Mrs. Bass	Prufrock Preparatory School	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131123.The_Austere_Academy
