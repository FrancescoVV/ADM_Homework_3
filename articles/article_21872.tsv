Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder		Rachel Reiland	3.91	5904	329	With astonishing honesty, this memoir, Get Me Out of Here , reveals what mental illness looks and feels like from the inside, and how healing from borderline personality disorder is possible through intensive therapy and the support of loved ones. A mother, wife, and working professional, Reiland was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at the age of 29â€”a diagnosis that finally explained her explosive anger, manipulative behaviors, and self-destructive episodes including bouts of anorexia, substance abuse, and promiscuity. A truly riveting read with a hopeful message.	436	June 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/421518.Get_Me_Out_of_Here
