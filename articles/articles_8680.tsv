Desperate for some headway, L recruits Misa to infiltrate the group and feed them information calculated to bring Kira into the open. But the Shinigami Rem reveals to Misa who the Kiras really are, and, armed with this knowledge, Misa will do anything to help Light. But what will that mean for L...?	215	April 2005	Light Yagami, Misa Amane, L Lawliet		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13620.Death_Note_Vol_6
