To Hell and Back	Dante Valentine #5	Lilith Saintcrow	3.85	4364	212	The pulse-pounding finale to Lilith Saintcrow's urban fantasy series featuring Dante Valentine. Dante Valentine has been through Hell. Literally. Her body shattered and her mind not far behind, she's dumped back into her own world to survive--or not--as a pawn in one of Lucifer's endless games. Unfortunately, he's just messed with the wrong Necromance. And this time she's mad enough to do something about it. This time, the Devil will pay.	416	January 1st 2008	Dante Valentine, Japhrimel, Lucas Villalobos		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1142757.To_Hell_and_Back
