Gallows Hill		Lois Duncan	3.76	2837	214	Role-playing takes on a terrifying cast when 17-year-old Sarah, who is posing as a fortune-teller for a school fair, begins to see actual visions that can predict the future. Frightened, the other students brand her a witch, setting off a chain of events that mirror the centuries-old Salem witch trials in more ways than one.	240	April 7th 1997		Missouri (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47774.Gallows_Hill
