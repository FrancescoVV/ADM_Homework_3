Omeros		Derek Walcott	4.01	2303	217	A poem in five books, of circular narrative design, titled with the Greek name for Homer, which simultaneously charts two currents of history: the visible history charted in events—the tribal losses of the American Indian, the tragedy of African enslavement—and the interior, unwritten epic fashioned from the suffering of the individual in exile.	325	1990		Saint Lucia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/786699.Omeros
