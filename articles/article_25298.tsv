Hunted Past Reason		Richard Matheson	3.11	892	124	It was supposed to be just an ordinary camping trip, two old friends hiking through the wilderness toward a remote cabin in the woods of northern California. But the enforced isolation of the hike soon exposes long-hidden rivalries and resentments between the two men. The deeper they get into the primeval wilderness and the farther from civilization, the greater the tension between them becomesâ€”until the simmering hostility erupts into a terrifying life-or-death battle for survival!	304	2002	Bob Hansen, Doug	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219545.Hunted_Past_Reason
