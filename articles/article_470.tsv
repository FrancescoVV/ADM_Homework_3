I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings	Maya Angelou's Autobiography #1	Maya Angelou	4.24	411907	10914	Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local "powhitetrash." At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors ("I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare") will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.	289	1969	Marguerite Johnson 'Maya', Bailey Johnson Jr., Annie Henderson 'Momma', Uncle Willie, Bailey Johnson, Vivian Baxter	Arkansas (United States), Louisiana (United States), California (United States), Missouri (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13214.I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings
