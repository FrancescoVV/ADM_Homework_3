The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories		Angela Carter	3.98	39111	3426	In The Bloody Chamber - which includes the story that is the basis of Neil Jordan's 1984 movie The Company of Wolves - Carter spins subversively dark and sensual versions of familiar fairy tales and legends like "Little Red Riding Hood," "Bluebeard," "Puss in Boots," and "Beauty and the Beast," giving them exhilarating new life in a style steeped in the romantic trappings of the gothic tradition.	128	1979			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49011.The_Bloody_Chamber_and_Other_Stories
