Bridge to Terabithia		Katherine Paterson	4.01	447201	12502	Jess Aarons' greatest ambition is to be the fastest runner in his grade. He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone. That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits.	190	October 21st 1977	Jesse Aarons, Leslie Burke	Virginia (United States), Lark Creek, Virginia (United States), Terabithia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940121-bridge-to-terabithia
