Breakfast of Champions		Kurt Vonnegut Jr.	4.07	223529	6967	In Breakfast of Champions, one of Kurt Vonnegutâ€™s most beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. What follows is murderously funny satire, as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth.	303	July 12th 1973	Kilgore Trout, Eliot Rosewater, Rabo Karabekian, Dwayne Hoover, Francine Pefko, Kazak, Wayne Hoobler, Cyprian Ukwende, Celia Hoover, Harry LeSabre, Bunny Hoover, Beatrice Keedlser, Bonnie MacMahon	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4980.Breakfast_of_Champions
