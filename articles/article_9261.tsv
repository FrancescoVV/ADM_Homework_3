Hometown Girl Memories	Hometown #6	Kirsten Fullmer	4.41	711	14	"I was crying one minute and laughing the next. A definite must read!" Winnie is content in her role as the reining matriarch of Smithville, but when a letter arrives from a long-lost friend, the door to her past is reopened. Memories come flooding in, drawing her back to 1968, her college days; a time filled with people and events she hasn’t allowed herself to recall. Tara knows her husband, Justin, is up to something. She may be crazy busy running her inn and trying to manage little Bella, but her gut tells her there’s more to Justin’s busy schedule than just work, and she’s determined to find out what it is. Join in the fun as Smithville’s leading ladies unite in this charming, must-read novel filled with love; past, present, and future.	310	October 1st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53132622-hometown-girl-memories
