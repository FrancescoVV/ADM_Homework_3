The Good Soldier Švejk	Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka za světové války #1-4	Jaroslav Hašek, Josef Lada, Lumír Nahodil, Cecil Parrott	4.11	14933	968	In The Good Soldier Švejk , celebrated Czech writer and anarchist Jaroslav Hašek combined dazzling wordplay and piercing satire in a hilariously subversive depiction of the futility of war. Good-natured and garrulous, Švejk becomes the Austrian army's most loyal Czech soldier when he is called up on the outbreak of World War I -- although his bumbling attempts to get to the front serve only to prevent him from reaching it. Playing cards and getting drunk, he uses all his cunning and genial subterfuge to deal with the police, clergy, and officers who chivy him toward battle. Cecil Parrott's vibrant translation conveys the brilliant irreverence of this classic about a hapless Everyman caught in a vast bureaucratic machine.	752	1923	Josef Švejk, Palivec, Bretschneider, Staff Warder Slavík, Chaplain Otto Katz, Lieutenant Lukáš, Colonel Friedrich Kraus von Zillergut, Captain Sagner, Colonel Schröder, Jurajda, 2nd Lieutenant Dub, Quartermaster Sergeant-Major Vaněk, Volunteer Marek, Vodička, Cadet Biegler, Captain Tayrle, General Fink von Finkenstein, Chaplain Martinec, "Sergeant Teveles", Baloun	Prague (Praha) (Czech Republic)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7629.The_Good_Soldier_vejk
