The Prodigal God: Recovering the Heart of the Christian Faith		Timothy J. Keller	4.39	31812	1783	Newsweek called renowned minister Timothy Keller "a C. S. Lewis for the twenty-first century" in a feature on his first book, The Reason for God . In that book, he offered a rational explanation of why we should believe in God. Now, in The Prodigal God , he uses one of the best-known Christian parables to reveal an unexpected message of hope and salvation. Taking his trademark intellectual approach to understanding Christianity, Keller uncovers the essential message of Jesus, locked inside his most familiar parable. Within that parable Jesus reveals God's prodigal grace toward both the irreligious and the moralistic. This book will challenge both the devout and skeptics to see Christianity in a whole new way. Look out for Timothy Keller's latest book, The Songs of Jesus , coming from Viking on November 10, 2015.	139	2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3116205-the-prodigal-god
