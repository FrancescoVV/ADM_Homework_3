Broadway Lights	Secrets of My Hollywood Life #5	Jen Calonita	4.03	2769	105	Her star power in demand on a hit Broadway play, Hollywood teen starlet Kaitlin Burke packs up her entourage (ok, her showbiz family, friends, assistant, and publicist, but not the dreamy boyfriend) and moves to the Big Apple for the summer. Kaitlin is the toast of the town and she hits the most exclusive New York nightspots, enjoys the best food (Hello, Magnolia Bakery), and even guests as a celebrity host on Saturday Night Live! But New York isn't all cupcakes and virgin daiquiris. Long distance and a handsome new costar put a huge strain on her relationship with Austin, and it turns out Broadway divas are a whole different breed of neuroses and competition from starlets.	384	March 2010	Kaitlin Burke, Sky Mackenzie, Austin Meyers, Nadine Cobb, Meg Burke, Matthew Burke, Liz Mendes, Rodney (SOMHL), Laney Peters, Hutch Adams, Drew Thomas, Ryan Joseph, Ava Hayden, Lauren Cobb		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6441387-broadway-lights
