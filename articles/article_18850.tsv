Article Three	Systemet #1	Anna Jakobsson Lund	3.90	249	83	Trust will get you killed – and trust will keep you alive In a world where the System governs everything, Ava’s a rebel – one who can control other people’s thoughts with her mind. As part of a resistance movement preparing for war, this is a useful skill. Levi stopped believing in the struggle for freedom when it snatched his parents from him. Now he’s just trying to live a quiet life and control the voices that threaten his sanity. One night Levi’s sister is arrested. To free her, he has to break old promises and get involved with people he swore he’d never associate with. Ava’s ordered to help him and, together, they leave on a rescue mission. She says he has to trust the rebels. But should they?	349	March 3rd 2015	Ava, Levi, Leymah		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32665692-article-three
