Bid the Gods Arise (The Wells of the Worlds, #1)		Robert Mullin	4.16	85	40	Kidnapped from his homeworld and sold into slavery, Maurin despairs of ever seeing his cousin or his home again. When he is ransomed by a mysterious woman and reunited with Aric, he joins an unlikely group committed to the downfall of the slave trade. But it isn't long before he realizes they are being hunted--not only by the blood-lusting head of the slave ring, but by an ancient evil that wants their souls.	478	December 12th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16180723-bid-the-gods-arise
