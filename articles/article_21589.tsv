The Last Jihad	The Last Jihad #1	Joel C. Rosenberg	4.17	8686	684	Jon Bennett and Erin McCoy are two of the shrewdest strategists on Wall Street and close friends of the president of the United States. Their secret project: a billion-dollar oil deal off the coast of Tel Aviv and Gaza that could form the basis of a historic peace treaty and bring enormous wealth to every Israeli and Palestinian. But nothing has prepared Jon or Erin for the terror that lies ahead. •Terrorists hijack a jet plane and fly a kamikaze mission into an American city. •Israeli commandos foil a nuclear attack, but find evidence that the next targets could be Washington and New York. •And suddenly the United States finds itself in a war in the Middle East over terrorism and weapons of mass destruction that will forever change the course of human history.	307	December 6th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/342362.The_Last_Jihad
