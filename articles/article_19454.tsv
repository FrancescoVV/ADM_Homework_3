The Meat Hunter		Megan  Allen	4.12	217	134	Molly Bishop grew up on a farm and was horrified by her father’s indifference toward the animals they raised, viewed only as slabs of flesh to be consumed by a ravenous society. Now a seductive and cunning young woman, she seeks out the cruelest members of the meat industry and offers up her own brand of redemption. Molly’s mission is clear. Those who raise animals for meat should understand what it feels like to become meat. But the FBI is onto her— they’ve sent in Michael Lair, a whip-smart agent with his own set of demons. And as a deadly game of cat-and-mouse ensues in the nation’s heartland, they must rely on their instincts and intellect to determine who prevails.	295	March 20th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48712876-the-meat-hunter
