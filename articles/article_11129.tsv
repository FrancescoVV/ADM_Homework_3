Whispers		Belva Plain	3.78	1776	99	It can happen in the best of families--even the Fergusons. When Lynn and Robert first meet, she's bright, fresh-faced twenty-year old; he's handsome, a bit older, a charming young executive on the fast track. From the start they fall deeply in love, thrilled by the discovery of their mutual desire. But as early as their honeymoon the gold begins to tarnish, when Robert's anger erupts into a physical assault, one for which Lynn blames herself. To all appearances Lynn and Robert are living the ultimate American dream-a lovely home in an exclusive Connecticut suburb, a picture-perfect marriage, two beautiful children, a country club membership, and wonderful friends. But not even with their closest friends can Lynn reveal what is truly happening to her family. Their secret life is betrayed only is whispers of what goes on behind closed doors.	331	April 1st 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16743.Whispers
