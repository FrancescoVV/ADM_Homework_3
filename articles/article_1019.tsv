Archer's Voice		Mia Sheridan	4.39	83740	9834	When Bree Prescott arrives in the sleepy, lakeside town of Pelion, Maine, she hopes against hope that this is the place where she will finally find the peace she so desperately seeks. On her first day there, her life collides with Archer Hale, an isolated man who holds a secret agony of his own. A man no one else sees. Archer's Voice is the story of a woman chained to the memory of one horrifying night and the man whose love is the key to her freedom. It is the story of a silent man who lives with an excruciating wound and the woman who helps him find his voice. It is the story of suffering, fate, and the transformative power of love.	345	January 25th 2014	Archer Hale, Bree Prescott	Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32822135-archer-s-voice
