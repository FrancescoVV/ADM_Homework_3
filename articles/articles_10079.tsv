Marked in Flesh	The Others #4	Anne Bishop	4.27	23847	2109	15 hrs 21 mins For centuries, the Others and humans have lived side by side in uneasy peace. But when humankind oversteps its bounds, the Others will have to decide how much humanity they’re willing to tolerate—both within themselves and within their community... Since the Others allied themselves with the cassandra sangue , the fragile yet powerful human blood prophets who were being exploited by their own kind, the delicate dynamic between humans and Others changed. Some, like Simon Wolfgard, wolf shifter and leader of the Lakeside Courtyard, and blood prophet Meg Corbyn, see the new, closer companionship as beneficial—both personally and practically. But not everyone is convinced. A group of radical humans is seeking to usurp land through a series of violent attacks on the Others. What they don’t realize is that there are older and more dangerous forces than shifters and vampires protecting the land that belongs to the Others—and those forces are willing to do whatever is necessary to protect what is theirs…	399	March 8th 2016	Meg Corbyn, Vladimir Sanguinati, Merri Lee, Simon Wolfgard, Henry Beargard, Crispin James Montgomery, Blair Wolfgard, Karl Kowalski, Nathan Wolfgard, Erebus Sanguinati, Douglas Burke, Joe Wolfgard, Tess, Hope Wolfsong, Jackson Wolfgard, Jesse Walker, Stavros Sanguinati, Tolya Sanguinati, Nyx Sanguinati		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22062202-marked-in-flesh
