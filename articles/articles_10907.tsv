The Damned Utd		David Peace	4.13	6921	369	Overachieving and eccentric football manager Brian Clough was on his way to take over at the country's most successful, and most reviled football club: Leeds United, home to a generation of fiercely competitive but ageing players. The battle he'd face there would make or break the club - or him. David Peace's extraordinarily inventive novel tells the story of a world characterised by fear of failure and hunger for success set in the bleak heart of the 1970s.	346	August 17th 2006		Leeds, Yorkshire, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/984021.The_Damned_Utd
