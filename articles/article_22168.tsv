End of the Civil War	Drew Steele Civil War Mystery #2	E.E. Doc Murdock	4.50	6	1	The End of the Civil War is a fast-paced western/murder mystery/war story that plays out in the American West soon after the supposed end of Civil War. It asks the question, what would happen if some Confederates had refused to give up and instead moved West to form alliances with anti-American militants? The story begins when a Confederate general known for his ruthless tactics in the war suddenly appears in the West along with his loyal company of men. When the general begins to wreak havoc in California and Arizona, famous San Francisco detective, Drew Steele, is hired to be a go-between negotiator. The cat-and-mouse game that ensues leads from California, through Mexico, and into the mountains of Arizona. It pits two brilliant minds against each other in a life and death struggle against a backdrop of spectacular Western scenery.	296	January 18th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17342390-end-of-the-civil-war
