The Four Seasons of Brambly Hedge	Brambly Hedge #1-4	Jill Barklem	4.53	443	54	The Brambly Hedge books are a modern publishing phenomenon. The first four little books, published in 1980, have now been reprinted more than twenty times, and sales are in the millions. Jill Barklem chose the original small format herself: it seemed to suit her miniature community of self-sufficient mice. But her ability to visualize the detail of Brambly Hedge deserves a closer look, and for this reason the original pictures have now been re-organized to a larger size. At last Brambly Hedge can be enjoyed in all its detail, displaying Jill Barklem's artistic talent to the full. The Four Season of Brambly Hedge begins with a twenty-page "conversation" with Jill Barklem, illustrated with her early sketches and notebooks. This fascinating material has never been published before: it traces the origins and development of Brambly Hedge and reveals the artist's total commitment to her vision.	144	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/924094.The_Four_Seasons_of_Brambly_Hedge
