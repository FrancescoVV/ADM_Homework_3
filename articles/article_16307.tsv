Child of the Morning		Pauline Gedge	4.14	3482	248	She ruled Egypt not as Queen but as Pharaoh, thirty five centuries ago. Yet her name--Hatshepsut--does not appear in dynastic scrolls, nor is her reign celebrated on monuments. This is the story of the young woman who assumed the throne of Egypt, mastered the arts of war and government, lived her life by her own design, and ruled an empire--the only woman Pharaoh in history.	403	1977	Hatshepsut		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296570.Child_of_the_Morning
