Evil Under the Sun	Hercule Poirot #24	Agatha Christie	3.98	49221	1995	It seems that no matter how hard he tries, Poirot never quite gets a holiday. This story sees him in Devon, Agatha Christie’s home county, and, of course, among the scantily clad sunbathers, a murdered woman is found. It was not unusual to find the beautiful bronzed body of the sun-loving Arlena Stuart stretched out on a beach, face down. Only, on this occasion, there was no sun… she had been strangled. Ever since Arlena’s arrival at the resort, Hercule Poirot had detected sexual tension in the seaside air. But could this apparent ‘crime of passion’ have been something more evil and premeditated altogether?	220	1941	Hercule Poirot, Arlena Stuart, Captain Kenneth Marshall, Linda Marshall, Patrick Redfern, Christine Redfern, Rosamund Darnley, Carrie Gardener, Odell Gardener, Emily Brewster, Major Barry, Reverend Stephen Lane, Horace Blatt, Inspector Colgate, Chief Constable Colonel Weston	Devon, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16305.Evil_Under_the_Sun
