Pole is a highly touching novel that deals with the personal life of the author. Indeed a highly touching book that will make people stop and think about the good opportunities one has in life. It equally makes one understand spirituality in a better manner, although exquisitely told, the words are simple, yet complex. The vital reality of religious faith is also geared into a more friendly guise of explanation and loving testimony. How a young torture survivor fought back, and won. A woman who, although born disabled, became a Buddhist religious leader. Changing lives for the good, and fought back against medical bands of criminals. Now studying mortuary science, the dying author continues to do the work of God. Her over all message is quite clear. Also depth fully depicting what it's like to spend all of one's life at the end of ani.v. pole. The profound philosophy involved that has already changed so many people's perceptions regarding the spiritual integrity of those whom are medically frail.	496	August 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2888160-eternal-i-v-pole
