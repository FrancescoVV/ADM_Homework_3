Lionheart	Plantagenets #4	Sharon Kay Penman	4.10	6063	665	They were called "The Devil's Brood," though never to their faces. They were the four surviving sons of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine. With two such extraordinary parents, much was expected of them. But the eldest-charming yet mercurial-would turn on his father and, like his brother Geoffrey, meet an early death. When Henry died, Richard would take the throne and, almost immediately, set off for the Holy Land. This was the Third Crusade, and it would be characterized by internecine warfare among the Christians and extraordinary campaigns against the Saracens. And, back in England, by the conniving of Richard's youngest brother, John, to steal his crown.	594	2011	Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard I of England, Saladin, Berengaria of Navarre, Philippe II of France, John of England, William Marshal		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10437680-lionheart
