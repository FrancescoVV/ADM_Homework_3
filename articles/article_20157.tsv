From the darkness of fallout, mutants and a race of vampires known as the Nobility have spawned. They rule the weak with no remorse. Once bitten by a Nobility, one is cursed to become a member of the undead. Villagers cower in fear, hoping and praying for a savior to rid them of their undying nightmare. All they have to battle this danger is a different kind of danger -- a Vampire Hunter.	250	January 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/525371.Hideyuki_Kikuchi_s_Vampire_Hunter_D_Volume_01
