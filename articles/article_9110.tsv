Cosmic		Frank Cottrell Boyce	3.93	5013	796	Liam is too big for his boots. And his football strip. And his school blazer. But being super-sized height-wise has its advantages: he's the only eleven-year-old to ever ride the G-force defying Cosmic rollercoaster - or be offered the chance to drive a Porsche. Long-legged Liam makes a giant leap for boy-kind by competing with a group of adults for the chance to go into space. Is Liam the best boy for the job? Sometimes being big isn't all about being a grown-up.	256	May 15th 2008	Liam Digby, Florida Kirby, Dinah Drax, Edhem 'Eddie' Xanadu, Hassan Xandu, Monsieur Martinet, Maximum 'Max' Martinet, Samson One Toure, Samson Two, Alan Bean, Lorraine Sass, Ibiza Kirby, Orlando Kirby		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1999660.Cosmic
