The BFG		Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake	4.22	375792	10233	Captured by a giant! The BFG is no ordinary bone-crunching giant. He is far too nice and jumbly. It's lucky for Sophie that he is. Had she been carried off in the middle of the night by the Bloodbottler, the Fleshlumpeater, the Bonecruncher, or any of the other giants-rather than the BFG-she would have soon become breakfast. When Sophie hears that they are flush-bunking off in England to swollomp a few nice little chiddlers, she decides she must stop them once and for all. And the BFG is going to help her!	199	November 1st 1982	the Big Friendly Giant, Queen Elizabeth II, Sophie (the BFG), The Fleshlumpeater, The Bonecruncher, The Manhugger, The Childchewer, The Meatdripper, The Gizzardgulper, The Maidmasher, The Bloodbottler, The Butcher Boy, Mary (the BFG), Mr. Tibbs (the BFG)	United Kingdom, London, England (United Kingdom), England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6319.The_BFG
