Sword of Sand		Jon Oden	4.50	4	3	William Giles is the best collection muscle around. So when the boss's girlfriend tries to skip town, it is only natural Giles is sent to collect her. Unfortunately, it is a set up that leaves a friend dead and that friend's young family in danger. With no way out, Giles must go on a suicide mission to North Africa with a group of highly trained, yet unmotivated, gangsters to rescue the son of a prominent Chicago businessman. To make matters even worse, the son happens to be a German soldier in Rommel's Afrika Korps. With the squad's commander controlled by the Nazis and an FBI snitch on his team, Giles' chance of survival dwindles with each bullet riddled day.	295	June 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11253978-sword-of-sand
