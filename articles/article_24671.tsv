The Band Room		Bob Seay	4.92	13	8	"It doesn't matter what you did. You're here now. We'll start with that. "The Band Room" is a snow globe depiction of America in a time when tribalism, anger, and hate collide with diversity, acceptance, and compassion. It's about standing up for what you believe and standing with others when you need to. It's a reminder that everyone is doing the best they can and a love letter to band and choir students everywhere. Angel is a football player who literally stumbles into trouble with the police. Rejected by his coach and teammates, Angel must form new relationships with people who don't look like him, don't think like him, and do not act like anyone he has ever known. Life at home isn't much better. His mother's increasingly erratic behavior has turned her into someone Angel no longer recognizes. Will he rescue her before it's too late?	282	July 31st 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54770005-the-band-room
