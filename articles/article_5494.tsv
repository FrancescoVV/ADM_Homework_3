Deadly Pretty Strangers: One dead body, one bereaved mother, one small favour ...		Max Thorn	4.21	33	14	‘Help me find out who killed my son. Please.’ A heartfelt plea. And a little money involved. An ordinary cityworker tries to help out a bereaved old lady. If he’d known it would lead to a confrontation with Russian murderers using an outlawed nerve agent on the streets of London, a pretty sharpshooter with unreliable motives and a deadly spider scuttling around his living room, he’d have kept his front door firmly closed. A long-forgotten genetic research experiment just makes things even stranger. And more deadly.	314	November 12th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36600950-deadly-pretty-strangers
