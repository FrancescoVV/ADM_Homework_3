The Hours		Michael Cunningham	3.94	125410	5098	In 1920s London, Virginia Woolf is fighting against her rebellious spirit as she attempts to make a start on her new novel. A young wife and mother, broiling in a suburb of 1940s Los Angeles, yearns to escape and read her precious copy of Mrs Dalloway. And Clarissa Vaughan steps out of her smart Greenwich village apartment in 1990s New York to buy flowers for a party she is hosting for a dying friend. The Hours recasts the classic story of Woolf's Mrs Dalloway in a startling new light. Moving effortlessly across the decades and between England and America, this exquisite novel intertwines the worlds of three unforgettable women.	230	November 1st 1998	Clarissa Vaughan, Laura Brown, Virginia Woolf	London, England (United Kingdom), New York City, New York (United States), Los Angeles, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11899.The_Hours
