Why I Live at the P.O. and Other Stories		Eudora Welty	4.23	934	55	Eudora Welty is one of America's most distinguished writers. Her reputation rests largely on her skill and delicacy in portraying a wide range of characters, rich and poor, black and white. Her style is marked by her perception of the Southern character, her ear for colloquial speech and her ability to endow her portraits of small-town life with a universal significance. Included are four stories that capture the heart of the American South.	90	1941			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1369974.Why_I_Live_at_the_P_O_and_Other_Stories
