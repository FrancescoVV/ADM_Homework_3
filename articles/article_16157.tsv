School. Hasn't This Gone on Long Enough?	Dear Dumb Diary #13	Jim Benton	4.23	2315	66	Bestselling author Jim Benton is back, with a brand-new spin on a favorite series! Dear Dumb Diary is a hilarious hit! Now after 12 books (each covering a month of her life), Jamie Kelly's upcoming diaries have a fresh look and a fun twist. It's Dear Dumb Diary: Year Two! The diary entries are still laugh-out-loud funny -- but this is a whole new beginning. Everything is another year dumber! As Jamie grapples with school, grades, and middle school's Big Questions, don't miss even more of her words of wisdom like, "If someone is really, really intelligent, it would be polite if they would ugly it up a bit before they left the house." (Jamie STILL has no idea that anybody is reading her diary. So please, please, please don't tell her.)	160	January 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11684505-school-hasn-t-this-gone-on-long-enough
