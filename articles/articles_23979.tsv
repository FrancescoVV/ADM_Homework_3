The Hazards of Skinny Dipping	Hazards #1	Alyssa Rose Ivy	3.67	4390	377	This isn't a deep book about first loves or self-discovery. If you want a book like that, I'd be happy to recommend one, but I don't have that kind of story to tell. Instead my story is about rash decisions and finding out that your dream guy is bad in bed. It's the story of when I finally went skinny dipping, and how my life was never the same again. Oh, and it's also the story of my freshman year of college and realizing Mr. Right might have been there all along.	248	May 17th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17408503-the-hazards-of-skinny-dipping
