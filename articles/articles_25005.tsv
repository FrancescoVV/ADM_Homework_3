One Day in My Life		Bobby Sands, Gerry Adams	4.38	541	43	Bobby Sands was twenty-seven years old when he died. He spent almost nine years of his life in prison because of his Irish republican activities. He died, in prison, on 5 May 1981, on the sixty-sixth day of his hunger strike at Long Kesh, outside Belfast. This book documents a day in the life of Bobby Sands. It is a tale of human bravery, endurance and courage against a backdrop of suffering, terror and harassment. It will live on as a constant reminder of events that should never have happened -- and will hopefully never happen again.	118	March 14th 1996	Bobby Sands		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/406660.One_Day_in_My_Life
