Veiled Madness		Greer Noble	4.50	34	18	A cowardly and macabre killing, depraved sex, illicit drug use, blackmail and murder, the daring rescue of a fugitive from a hostile African state and the hunt at night for a marauding lion; these events, nevertheless, pale in comparison with the shocking discovery of the identities of the people responsible for the crimes, their reason for committing them and their ultimate fate. http: //greernoble.com	400	March 3rd 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11785661-veiled-madness
