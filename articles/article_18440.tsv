The Queen of the South in Matthew 12:42		Soleilmavis Liu	4.33	3	2	The Bible prophesies the Queen of the South will rise at the judgment, but did not give her name or any other detail about her. "The Queen of the South in Matthew 12:42," authored by Soleilmavis Liu, is a strong and well-reasoned piece that demonstrates who the Queen of the South is, by using plenty of historical facts. It lets readers understand where the Ends of the Earth are, how the Queen of the South will come from the Ends of the Earth, and what the judgment is. Ultimately, readers will come to know God's great plan regarding the Queen of the South. Soleilmavis hopes that her presentation sheds new light on this important person, who will play a decisive role in the history. This book is a step in that direction.	479	February 27th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22545705-the-queen-of-the-south-in-matthew-12
