Fate Is the Hunter		Ernest K. Gann	4.54	2109	196	Ernest K. Gann’s classic pilot's memoir is an up-close and thrilling account of the treacherous early days of commercial aviation. “Few writers have ever drawn readers so intimately into the shielded sanctum of the cockpit, and it is hear that Mr. Gann is truly the artist” ( The New York Times Book Review ). “A splendid and many-faceted personal memoir that is not only one man’s story but the story, in essence, of all men who fly” ( Chicago Tribune ). In his inimitable style, Gann brings you right into the cockpit, recounting both the triumphs and terrors of pilots who flew when flying was anything but routine.	416	1961			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/533779.Fate_Is_the_Hunter
