Queen of Hearts	Queen of Hearts Saga #1	Colleen Oakes	3.66	8102	1551	The first novel in Colleen Oakes’s epic, imaginative series tells the origin of one of the most infamous villains—the Queen of Hearts. Dinah is the princess who will one day reign over Wonderland. She has not yet seen the dark depths of her kingdom; she longs only for her father’s approval and a future with the boy she loves. But when a betrayal breaks her heart and threatens her throne, she is launched into Wonderland’s dangerous political game. Dinah must stay one step ahead of her cunning enemies or she’ll lose not just the crown but her head. Evil is brewing in Wonderland and maybe, most frighteningly, in Dinah herself.	319	February 12th 2014		Wonderland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26074194-queen-of-hearts
