Krazy and Ignatz, 1925-1926: There is a Heppy Land Furfur A-waay	Krazy and Ignatz	George Herriman, Chris Ware	4.43	369	14	Fantagraphics is proud to re-present Krazy Kat to a new generation of readers. Each volume in this series reprints two full years of Sunday strips, or 104 full-page, black-and-white Sunday strips (Herriman did not incorporate color into the strip until 1935). Krazy Kat is a love story, focusing on the relationship of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse hated Krazy Kat, the expression of which was in throwing bricks at Krazy's head. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect "her" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless), mostly by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the other's true motivations. This simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth that led critics like Gilbert Seldes and E. E. Cummings to recognize Herriman's genius almost immediately. Each of Fantagraphics' Krazy Ignatz volumes is designed by Chris Ware, creator of the wildly successful ACME Novelty Library series. This beautiful volume includes material never collected before.	120	April 17th 2002	Krazy Kat, Ignatz Mouse		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231532.Krazy_and_Ignatz_1925_1926
