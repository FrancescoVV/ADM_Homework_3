Keep Me		Leah Holt	3.89	255	58	I'm his captive. . . and I want him to keep me. I was only a child when everything changed. Too young to understand, too old to forget. Broken and damaged. I thought nothing good could ever happen to me, but ten years later, something did. I met a man. He swept me off my feet and swooned me into his bed. Cole's touch was perfect. His lips were made of velvet obsession, they helped me forget the memories that burned me from the inside out. For the first time in forever, I was happy. Then he locked me inside his home. He told me it was for my safety. And it was so easy to believe him. I was tired of looking over my shoulder, tired of the fear that someone was always watching me. Cole wanted to protect me. I was ready to let him. With him holding me close, all the evil in the world can't reach me. But what happens when our pasts collide, threatening to tear us apart?					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36669983-keep-me
