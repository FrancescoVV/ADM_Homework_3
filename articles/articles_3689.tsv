Moon Called	Mercy Thompson #1	Patricia Briggs	4.15	177359	8438	Mercedes Thompson, aka Mercy, is a talented Volkswagen mechanic living in the Tri-Cities area of Washington. She also happens to be a walker, a magical being with the power to shift into a coyote at will. Mercy's next-door neighbor is a werewolf. Her former boss is a gremlin. And she's fixing a bus for a vampire. This is the world of Mercy Thompson, one that looks a lot like ours but is populated by those things that go bump in the night. And Mercy's connection to those things is about to get her into some serious hot water...	289	January 31st 2006	Adam Hauptman, Samuel Cornick, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Leah Cornick, Charles Cornick, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Kyle Brooks, Stefan Uccello, Alan "Mac" MacKenzie Frazier, Marsilia, Auriele Zao, Elizaveta Arkadyevna Vyshnevetskaya, Gabriel Sandoval, Tony Montenegro, David Christiansen, Bran "The Marrok" Cornick, Ben Shaw	Tri-Cities, Washington (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71811.Moon_Called
