But when her sister winds up engaged after a whirlwind courtship, she’s thrown in to close contact with exactly the kind of sexy playboy she wants to avoid—the gorgeous best man.

Because the one woman who refuses to be caught may be the only one Vaughn can’t live without…	304	May 6th 2014		Chicago, Illinois (United States), Wisconsin (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18136549-it-happened-one-wedding
