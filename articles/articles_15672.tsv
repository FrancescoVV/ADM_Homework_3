Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare		Stephen Greenblatt	3.86	9283	740	A young man from a small provincial town moves to London in the late 1580s and, in a remarkably short time, becomes the greatest playwright not of his age alone but of all time. How is an achievement of this magnitude to be explained? Stephen Greenblatt brings us down to earth to see, hear, and feel how an acutely sensitive and talented boy, surrounded by the rich tapestry of Elizabethan life, could have become the worldâ€™s greatest playwright.	438	2004	William Shakespeare	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622782-will-in-the-world
