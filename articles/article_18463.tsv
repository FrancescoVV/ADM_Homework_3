The Auric Insignia (The Aurelian Epics Book 1)		Perry Horste, Tommaso Tagliabue	4.13	8	4	In the northernmost part of the realm of man, in a cottage on the outskirts of the small, isolated village of Brightseed, lives Roarke. In the shadow of the mountain range that signifies the end of the civilized world, he leads a simple life in solitude, far away from the rumored brilliance of the southern cities. Or so he thought... Until one night, when he is awakened by an animal that leads him to one of his snares, where he finds something that shakes his set view of the world he lives in, and of the people that he shares it with. Something that will put him on a journey, filled with injustice, betrayal and death.	224	March 20th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25189090-the-auric-insignia
