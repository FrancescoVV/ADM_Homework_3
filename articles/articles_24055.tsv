Tatya Tope's Operation Red Lotus		Parag Top√©	4.33	45	8	Tatya Tope's Operation Red Lotus is a quest to understand the real history of the Anglo-Indian war of 1857. A quest by the contemporary members of the Tope family, which led to the discovery of the dramatic battle manoeuvres of their ancestor, the legendary Tatya Tope, as well as the true import of the war. It covers the detailed planning of the war and the logistical issues that were overcome to allow the Indian troops to march over a million man-miles in the early months of the war. Hundreds of Urdu letters written to Tatya during the war, which have never been published before, were translated to demonstrate Tatya's administrative acumen in running a full-fledged government in parallel. Operation Red Lotus is the first detailed account of Tatya Tope that covers his entire campaign from the planning of the war until his death; and offers a surprising answer to the generations-old question - 'was the man hanged on 18 April 1859, Tatya Tope?	468	March 10th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9248826-tatya-tope-s-operation-red-lotus
