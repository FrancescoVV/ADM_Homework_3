The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society		Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.	3.53	419	53	Arthur Schlesinger Jr asks in this book What does it mean to be an American?.

But now there is a new orthodoxy: America as a collection of self-interest groups, celebrating difference and abandoning the idea of assimilation.	160	May 1st 1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250824.The_Disuniting_of_America
