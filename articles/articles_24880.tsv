Testimony		Anita Shreve	3.57	27882	3333	At a New England boarding school, a sex scandal is about to break. Even more shocking than the sexual acts themselves is the fact that they were caught on videotape. A Pandora's box of revelations, the tape triggers a chorus of voices--those of the men, women, teenagers, and parents involved in the scandal--that details the ways in which lives can be derailed or destroyed in one foolish moment. Writing with a pace and intensity surpassing even her own greatest work, Anita Shreve delivers in Testimony a gripping emotional drama with the impact of a thriller. No one more compellingly explores the dark impulses that sway the lives of seeming innocents, the needs and fears that drive ordinary men and women into intolerable dilemmas, and the ways in which our best intentions can lead to our worst transgressions.	320	2008	Noelle, Silas Quinney, Mike Bordwin, Rob Leicht, Meg Bordwin, Owen Quinney, Anna Quinney, Sienna, Ellen Leicht, Kasia Gorzynski, Geoff Coggeshall	United States of America, Avery, Vermont (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3121162-testimony
