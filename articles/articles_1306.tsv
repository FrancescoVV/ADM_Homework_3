Dead Souls		Nikolai Gogol, Robert A. Maguire	3.97	66589	2528	Dead Souls is eloquent on some occasions, lyrical on others, and pious and reverent elsewhere. Nicolai Gogol was a master of the spoof. The American students of today are not the only readers who have been confused by him. Russian literary history records more divergent interpretations of Gogol than perhaps of any other classic. In a new translation of the comic classic of Russian literature, Chichikov, an enigmatic stranger and conniving schemer, buys deceased serfs' names from their landlords' poll tax lists hoping to mortgage them for profit and to reinvent himself as a likeable gentleman.	464	1842	Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikof	Russian Empire	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28381.Dead_Souls
