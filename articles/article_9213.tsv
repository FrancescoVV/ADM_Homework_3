Geography Club	Russel Middlebrook #1	Brent Hartinger	3.74	14571	799	I knew that any wrong action, however slight, could reveal my true identity... Russel is still going on dates with girls. Kevin would do anything to prevent his teammates on the baseball team from finding out. Min and Terese tell everyone they're really just good friends. But after a while, the truth's too hard to hide - at least from each other - so they form the "Geography Club." Nobody else will come. Why would they want to? Their secret should be safe.	226	March 1st 2003	Russel Middlebrook, Kevin Land		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94072.Geography_Club
