I Never Promised You a Rose Garden		Hannah  Green, Joanne Greenberg	3.87	28315	984	I Never Promised You a Rose Garden is the story of a sixteen-year-old who retreats from reality into the bondage of a lushly imagined but threatening kingdom, and her slow and painful journey back to sanity. Chronicles the three-year battle of a mentally ill, but perceptive, teenage girl against a world of her own creation, emphasizing her relationship with the doctor who gave her the ammunition of self-understanding with which to help herself. "I wrote this novel, which is a fictionalized autobiography, to give a picture of what being schizophrenic feels like and what can be accomplished with a trusting relationship between a gifted therapist and a willing patient. It is not a case history or study. I like to think it is a hymn to reality." â€”Joanne Greenberg	288	1964	Helene, Carla, Deborah Blau, Esther Blau, Dr. Fried (Furii), Miss Coral, Jacob Blau		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45220.I_Never_Promised_You_a_Rose_Garden
