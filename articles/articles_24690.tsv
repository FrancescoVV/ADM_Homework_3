And she expected to go on earning her own living for no man had shown signs of wanting to marry her--least of all the mysterious Professor Dominic van Wijkelen. Certainly he admired her nursing skills. He confidently asked her to take on his private cases, which took Abigail from London to Holland then Spain.
