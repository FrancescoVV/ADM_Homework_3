Two Hundred Years Together	Двести лет вместе #1-2	Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn	3.88	74	12	This edition is an abridged version. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who first exposed the horrors of the Stalinist gulag, is now attempting to tackle one of the most sensitive topics of his writing career - the role of the Jews in the Bolshevik revolution and Soviet purges. In his latest book Solzhenitsyn, 84, deals with one of the last taboos of the communist revolution: that Jews were as much perpetrators of the repression as its victims. Two Hundred Years Together - a reference to the 1772 partial annexation of Poland and Russia which greatly increased the Russian Jewish population - contains three chapters discussing the Jewish role in the revolutionary genocide and secret police purges of Soviet Russia.	539	2002		Russian Federation	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28008677-two-hundred-years-together
