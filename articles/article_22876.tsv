Captive		Gabrielle Estres	3.92	136	14	"An unapologetic and haunting tale of power, vengeance, betrayal and the eternal quality of love." Faced with an insurmountable enemy and betrayed by those he once trusted, Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia and Duke of Amlas and Fagaras, will stop at nothing to defend his throne and his country against the superior Ottoman might. Determined to destroy Sultan Mehmed, the man who was once his closest friend and who now threatens to destroy his people, the Prince willingly descends into the realms of hell, giving up his very soul in return for victory and revenge. Tempted by power and blinded by his burning need for vengeance, the Prince devices a diabolical plan which will have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty. But when this terrible, merciless tyrant sets eyes on the innocent girl he has chosen as the unwitting instrument of his vengeance, he will finally learn what it means to love. Torn between power, vengeance and love, he will drag her into his world, driven to possess her heart and soul.		2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38210098-captive
