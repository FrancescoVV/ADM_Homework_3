The Lorax		Dr. Seuss	4.34	284731	4121	"UNLESS someone like you...cares a whole awful lot...nothing is going to get better...It's not." Long before saving the earth became a global concern, Dr. Seuss, speaking through his character the Lorax, warned against mindless progress and the danger it posed to the earth's natural beauty. His classic cautionary tale is now available in an irresistible mini-edition, perfect for backpack or briefcase, for Arbor Day, Earth Day, and every day.	72	1971	Lorax, Swomee-Swans, Brown Bar-ba-loots, Humming-Fishes		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7784.The_Lorax
