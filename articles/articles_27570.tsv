The Shadow Man		John Katzenbach	3.81	4402	258	In Berlin in 1943, he was known and dreaded as Der Schattenmann--a merciless "catcher" of Jews for the Nazis. Few saw his face and lived. In present-day Miami Beach, he has resurfaced--to silence forever the survivors who remember. Unless retired homicide detective Simon Winter can find him first.	437	1995		Miami Beach, Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67933.The_Shadow_Man
