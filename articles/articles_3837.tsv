Lysistrata		Aristophanes, Sarah Ruden	3.86	35299	952	Aristophanes' comic masterpiece of war and sex remains one of the greatest plays ever written. Led by the title character, the women of the warring city-states of Greece agree to withhold sexual favours with their husbands until they agree to cease fighting. The war of the sexes that ensues makes Lysistrata a bawdy comedy without peer in the history of theatre.	132	-411	Lysistrata	Greece	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1591.Lysistrata
