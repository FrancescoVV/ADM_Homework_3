Love & Gelato	Love & Gelato #1	Jenna Evans Welch	4.11	47203	7706	“I made the wrong choice.” Lina is spending the summer in Tuscany, but she isn’t in the mood for Italy’s famous sunshine and fairy-tale landscape. She’s only there because it was her mother’s dying wish that she get to know her father. But what kind of father isn’t around for sixteen years? All Lina wants to do is go back home. But then she is given a journal that her mom had kept when she lived in Italy. Suddenly Lina’s uncovering a magical world of secret romances, art, and hidden bakeries. A world that inspires her, along with the ever-so-charming Ren, to follow in her mother’s footsteps and unearth a secret that has been kept for far too long. It’s a secret that will change everything she knew about her mother, her father—and even herself. People come to Italy for love and gelato, someone tells her, but sometimes they discover much more.	389	May 3rd 2016	Lorenzo Ferrara, Odette Ferrara, Carolina Emerson, Howard Mercer, Hadley Emerson, Thomas Heath, Francesa Bernardo, Matteo Rossi	Tuscany (Italy), Florence (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25756328-love-gelato
