The Deadliest Monster: A Christian Introduction to Worldviews		J.F. Baldwin	4.14	316	39	In an exciting journey that begins with our assumptions about the nature of man, The Deadliest Monster explores the impact that such assumptions have on our beliefs about God, truth, morality, psychology and politics. Not surprisingly, the initial assumption colors all other beliefs, so that the book becomes a fascinating catalogue of the ways in which the Christian perspective better matches reality.	272	January 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/804699.The_Deadliest_Monster
