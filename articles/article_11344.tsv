Trust Trilogy	Shades of Love #1-4	Cristiane Serruya	4.07	129	31	Ethan, an international steel tycoon, traumatized by sexual experiences in his youth, has never believed he would be able to love a womanâ€”or be loved by one. Until he meets Sophia. Sophia, a wealthy Brazilian widow, fled her own country after a tragic incident. In London, with her 3 year-old daughter, she lives a lonely existence, torn between the love for a dead man, the angst of living with partial amnesia, and the fear of being discovered. But just after she begins a relationship with Ethan, she meets Alistair. Handsome and guilt-ridden, Alistair has no trouble finding women for one-night stands, who indulge him in his desire to physically punish them to abate his own tortured soul. A powerful banker from a traditional and noble Scottish family, he commands his business with a strong hand, and yet knows better than anyone that money truly cannot buy love or happiness. But it can buy distraction. After meeting Sophia, he will do anything to have her. If only once. In Europe, in the months after October 2009, their paths will cross and clash. Ethan, Sophia, and Alistair will need to overcome their pasts, fears, and pains and learn to see themselves through forgiving eyes. Or succumb to their misery. Eventually, wishes come true. So do nightmares.	1900	July 7th 2014		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40576715-shades-of-trust
