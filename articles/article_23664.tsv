#LNF		Greg Iles	4.01	10702	683	24 HOURS --- that's how long it takes a madman to pull off the perfect crime. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and no one can stop him. But this time, he's just picked the wrong family to terrorize. Because Will and Karen Jennings aren't going to watch helplessly as he victimizes them. And they aren't going to let him get away with it.	448	August 7th 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80634._LNF
