Violet Eyes		Debbie Viguié	3.96	5954	407	"ONCE UPON A TIME" IS TIMELESS When a storm brings the dashing Prince Richard to her family's farm, Violet falls in love at first sight. Richard also gives Violet his heart, but he knows his marriage is destined to be an affair of state, not of passion. For the king and queen have devised a contest to determine who will win their son's hand in marriage. To be reunited with her prince, Violet must compete against princesses from across the land. It will take all of her wits - and a little help from an unexpected source - if Violet is to demonstrate the depth of her character and become Richard's bride.	195	February 2nd 2010	Celeste White, Violet, Prince Richard, Queen Martha, Father Paul, Thomas (Debbie Viguié)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6609571-violet-eyes
