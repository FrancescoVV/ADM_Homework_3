AUGUST FLYNN once yearned to be human. He has a part to play. And he will play it, no matter the cost. THE WAR HAS BEGUN. THE MONSTERS ARE WINNING. Kate will have to return to Verity. August will have to let her back in. And a new monster is waitingâ€”one that feeds on chaos and brings out its victims' inner demons. Which will be harder to conquer: the monsters they face, or the monsters within?	512	June 13th 2017	August Flynn, Katherine "Kate" Olivia Harker, Sloan, Alice, Henry Flynn, Soro Flynn, Ilsa Flynn, Emily Flynn, Colin Stevenson	Prosperity, Verity	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075662-our-dark-duet
