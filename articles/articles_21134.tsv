The Master Builder		Henrik Ibsen	3.79	3381	147	First performed in 1892, this psychological drama is one of the great Norwegian playwright's most symbolic and lyrical works. The drama explores the insecurities of an aging architect, Halvard Solness, who suspects that his creative powers have diminished with age. Solness finds strength of purpose in his involvement with Hilda — his muse, inspiration, and ardent believer in his greatness — but their association leads to a conflict between heroic myth and complicated reality.	80	1892	Halvard Solness		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223634.The_Master_Builder
