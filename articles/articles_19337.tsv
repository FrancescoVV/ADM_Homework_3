Weakest Moments		E.J.  Williams	3.86	7	4	Jim Shannon is approaching forty years of age and leads an ordinary life. He travels from his motherâ€™s home in the leafy suburb of Cremorne to his job as a sales assistant in the city, and then back again, rarely drifting from the tracks that have become a rut. Natasha was raised as Jim was, but is his polar opposite. Craving success; she is independent and self-absorbed, driven by a past that has anchored her brother. Her job, a home on Sydney Harbour, her husband and twin boys, are all ticks in a life that projects prosperity. In the middle is Jenny, a single mother who has raised her children as best she could while carrying a secret that grew harder to tell with each day that passed. Enough of those days passed where it became impossible, and then unnecessary, to reveal what had been thrust upon her all those years ago after Rick had abandoned her: she had almost forgotten herself. As a family, they will be confronted with truths that will weaken and then galvanise; tragedy will be opposed by love, and bonds will be forged that will heal their weakest moments.
