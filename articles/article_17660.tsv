Day of the Predator	TimeRiders #2	Alex Scarrow	4.08	4586	362	Liam O’Connor should have died at sea in 1912. Maddy Carter should have died on a plane in 2010. Sal Vikram should have died in a fire in 2026. But all three have been given a second chance—to work for an agency that no-one knows exists. Its purpose—to prevent time travel destroying history . . . When Maddy mistakenly opens a time window where and when she shouldn’t have, Liam is marooned sixty-five million years ago in the hunting ground of a deadly—and until now—undiscovered species of predator. Can Liam make contact with Maddy and Sal before he’s torn to pieces by dinosaurs—and without endangering history so much that the world is overtaken by a terrifying new reality?	448	August 5th 2010	Lian O'Connor, Maddy Carter, Sal Vikram, Becks (TimeRiders)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8129464-day-of-the-predator
