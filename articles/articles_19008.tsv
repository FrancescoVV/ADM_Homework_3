Unapologetic	Unapologetic #1	Pamela Ann	3.76	269	33	Our story was bittersweet, sad, happy and hopeful. He was my first everything. I gave him my heart—coming in and out of my life whenever it was convenient for him. I gave him my all—though he graced the tabloids with different women in his arms. River Ellis was Hollywood’s golden bad boy. He rose to fame a few years before me. And now that I’m slowly gaining ground in the film industry, he decided it was time to charm me with his godly presence. For two years after he left me, I had built resistance; simply waiting for the day he’d come begging me back and I’d truly take pleasure in rejecting him. But time and time again, even though I’d set my heart and mind into doing one thing, life had a way of testing my will, my endurance.	5	August 14th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30224579-unapologetic
