Meanwhile, she starts to notice that water becomes agitated whenever she goes near it! One night, hands appear out of a puddle on the street and drag her into the water. She emerges from the water to find that she has been transported to an ancient village somewhere in the Middle East. She is then captured by armed troops and taken to the queen's palace, where she learns that the queen had her kidnapped so she can offer her blood as part of a ritual that will kill two princes in competition to inherit the kingdom.	188	May 26th 1995	YÅ«ri Suzuki, Kail Mursili	Hattusa (Turkey)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357399.Red_River_Vol_1
