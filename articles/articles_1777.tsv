Magic Study	Poison Study #2	Maria V. Snyder	4.03	72490	4797	You know your life is complicated when you miss your days as a poison taster... With her greatest enemy dead, and on her way to be united with the family she'd been stolen from long ago, Yelena should be pleased. But although she has gained her freedom, she once again finds herself alone - separated from her lover Valek and suspected as a spy for her reluctance to conform to Sitian ways. Despite the turmoil, she's eager to start her magic training - especially as she's been given one year to harness her power or be put to death. But her plans take a radical turn when she becomes embroiled in a plot to reclaim Ixia's throne for a lost prince - and gets entangled in powerful rivalries with her fellow magicians. If that wasn't bad enough, it appears her brother would love to see her dead. Luckily, Yelena has some old friends to help her with her new enemies.	392	September 26th 2006	Valek, Kiki, Zitora Cowan, Commander Ambrose, Irys Jewelrose, Cahill Ixia, Moon Man, Leif Zaltana, Janco, Opal Cowan, Yelena Zaltana, Ari, Roze Featherstone, Bain Bloodgood, Dax Greenblade, Gelsi Moon, Fisk, Goel, Perl Zaltana, Esau Zaltana, Captain Marrok	Sitia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46202.Magic_Study
