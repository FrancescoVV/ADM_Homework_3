The Declaration	The Declaration #1	Gemma Malley	3.71	21077	1669	In the year 2140, it is illegal to be young. Children are all but extinct. The world is a better place. Longevity drugs are a fountain of youth. Sign the Declaration, agree not to have children and you too can live forever. Refuse, and you will live as an outcast. For the children born outside the law, it only gets worse – Surplus status. Not everyone thinks Longevity is a good thing, but you better be clear what side you’re on. . . . Surplus Anna is about to find out what happens when you can’t decide if you should cheat the law or cheat death.	320	October 2nd 2007	Anna Covey, Mrs. Margaret Pincent, Peter Tomlinsin	Bloomsbury, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1722717.The_Declaration
