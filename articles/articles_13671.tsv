Last Song Before Night	The Harp and Ring Sequence #1	Ilana C. Myer	3.42	1140	268	Long ago, poets were Seers with access to powerful magic. Following a cataclysmic battle, the enchantments of Eivar were lostâ€“now a song is only words and music, and no more. But when a dark power threatens the land, poets who thought only to gain fame for their songs face a task much greater: to restore the lost enchantments to the world. And the road to the Otherworld, where the enchantments reside, will imperil their lives and test the deepest desires of their hearts.	415	September 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23704941-last-song-before-night
