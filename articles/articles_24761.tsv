The Eternal Highlander	MacNachton Vampires #1	Hannah Howell, Lynsay Sands	4.05	3866	122	Cathal MacNachton and Connall MacAdie are cousins bound by far more than blood ties and the rugged Highland landscape their clan calls home. The ancient curse of their ancestry has fated them to live by night with an unquenchable thirst that neither can tame. The only thing that can save their souls is marriage to Outsiders--mortals whose untainted blood will weaken the curse in their children and break the chains of fear that have made their clan a breed apart. Bridget Callan and Eva Caxton are the women who will shape the clan's destiny. Marriage to these strange and mysterious men will rescue each of them from desperate circumstances--and draw them into a web of danger, desire, and intrigue. . .	304	September 1st 2004	Bridget Callan, Cathal MacNachton, Eva Caxton, Connall MacAdie	Scottish Highlands	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1702668.The_Eternal_Highlander
