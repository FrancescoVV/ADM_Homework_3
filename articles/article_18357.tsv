Before she can share her successful medical findings with the scientific community, she's murdered. There is, however, one witness begging to come forward. Special is Katrina's wolf-hybrid dog. She saw her mistress die. She wants revenge. Now she has to convince food photographer, animal psychic, and Katrina's best friend Wheat Keigwin of the same thing.
