Hanging On To My Dreams: Bouncing Back From All Rejections		Arnold Henry	4.26	23	6	"Hanging on to My Dreams" is an inspiring autobiography that follows the first 23 years of Arnold Henry, a West Indian basketball player who overcomes many hurdles and disappointments on the road to fulfilling his American hoop dreams. The story starts with a portrayal of Arnold's Caribbean childhood in a difficult household where sports provided a dream and a means of escape. After becoming the first basketball player from Saint Lucia to be awarded a full basketball scholarship as a freshman as the highest level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States, Arnold Henry's victory lap took a dark turn as he saw more school leagues that he expected after being accused of a crime. This stirring narrative also deals with Arnold's struggle to integrate into the American culture and sports systems. Arnold Henry's will to succeed and his strength to hang on to his dreams illustrates how we can all attain our goals-no matter what society throws at us.	256	May 11th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12275635-hanging-on-to-my-dreams
