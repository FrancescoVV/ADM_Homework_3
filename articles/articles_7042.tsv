Curse of the Blue Tattoo: Being an Account of the Misadventures of Jacky Faber, Midshipman and Fine Lady	Bloody Jack #2	L.A. Meyer	4.25	11812	904	After being forced to leave HMS Dolphin and Jaimy, her true love, Jacky Faber is making a new start at the elite Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls in Boston. But growing up on the streets of London and fighting pirates never prepared Jacky for her toughest battle yet: learning how to be a fine lady. Everything she does is wrong. Her embroidery is deplorable, her French is atrocious, and her table manners--disgusting! Then there's the small matter of her blue anchor tattoo. . . . Despite her best efforts, Jacky can't seem to stay out of trouble long enough to dedicate herself to being ladylike. But what fun would that be, anyway?	504	January 1st 2004	Jacky Faber, James Emerson "Jaimy" Fletcher, Mam'selle Claudelle de Bour-bon, Miranda Pimm, Lissette maria Theresa de Lise, Reverend Richard Wilson Mather, Clarissa Worthington Howe, Randal Trevelyne, Amy Trevelyne, Ezra Pickering, Sylvie Rossio	Boston, Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295654.Curse_of_the_Blue_Tattoo
