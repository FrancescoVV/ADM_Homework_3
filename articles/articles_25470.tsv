The Fallow Season of Hugo Hunter		Craig Lancaster	3.71	909	80	From the bestselling author of 600 Hours of Edward comes the story of a boxer and a sportswriter whose fates are inextricably linked. Hugo Hunter, a would-be champion who never quite made it, is on his last legs. Thirty-seven years old, soft around the middle, and broke, he’s plummeted from his glory days of title fights to small-time bouts against brawlers and punks. Watching ringside for nearly twenty years has been Mark Westerly, a sportswriter who has struggled to keep a professional distance from the man whose life and career have become enmeshed with his own tumultuous trajectory. Hugo and Mark share a history that runs deep and has at times gotten ugly. As Hugo lands on the ropes again, Mark steps in to try to save him—and unburdens himself of long-held secrets regarding Hugo’s past. But can these two men, who’ve lived so long under the weight of their own tragedies, finally help each other find redemption?	298	November 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23270989-the-fallow-season-of-hugo-hunter
