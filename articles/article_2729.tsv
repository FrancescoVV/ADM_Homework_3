Winter's Tale		Mark Helprin	3.50	26292	4171	New York City is subsumed in arctic winds, dark nights, and white lights, its life unfolds, for it is an extraordinary hive of the imagination, the greatest house ever built, and nothing exists that can check its vitality. One night in winter, Peter Lake, orphan and master-mechanic, attempts to rob a fortress-like mansion on the Upper West Side. Though he thinks the house is empty, the daughter of the house is home. Thus begins the love between Peter Lake, a middle-aged Irish burglar, and Beverly Penn, a young girl, who is dying. Peter Lake, a simple, uneducated man, because of a love that, at first he does not fully understand, is driven to stop time and bring back the dead. His great struggle, in a city ever alight with its own energy and besieged by unprecedented winters, is one of the most beautiful and extraordinary stories of American literature.	748	1983	Peter Lake, Beverly Penn, Mootfowl, Issac Penn, Willa Penn, Harry Penn, Jayga, Pearly Soames	New York State (United States), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12967.Winter_s_Tale
