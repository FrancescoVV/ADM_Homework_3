A brother and sister with nothing but each other search for direction in a dead world. An ostracized teen, spiraling into madness, seeks revenge against those who abused and bullied him.

They're all on a collision course, fated to meet on a mountaintop - where the dead rains down from the sky.	389	July 12th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35689990-dead-fall
