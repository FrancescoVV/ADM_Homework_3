The Murders in the Rue Morgue	C. Auguste Dupin #1	Edgar Allan Poe	3.89	25629	1157	"The Murders in the Rue Morgue" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in "Graham's Magazine" in 1841. It has been recognized as the first modern detective story; Poe referred to it as one of his "tales of ratiocination." The concept of analyzing a fictional crime to find the resolution was new in its day. Here Poe's amateur detective, C. Auguste Dupin, takes an interest in the murder in Paris of two women. It was terribly brutal but difficult to categorize; there appeared to be no robbery or sexual assault, no obvious reason for the crimes. The newspapers carried sensational headlines. Dupin gets involved because the man arrested for the crimes, a M. Le Bon, had previously done him a favour. It becomes a challenge to him. Get set for a step back in the history of detective fiction that will leave the impression that it was written just a short while ago.	38	April 1st 1841	C.
