But laying low isn't in the cards for a spunky lass who finds trouble even when she's not looking for it. A school outing goes awry as Jacky and her classmates are abducted and forced into the hold of the Bloodhound , a ship bound for the slave markets on the Barbary Coast. All of Jacky's ingenuity, determination, and plain old good luck will be put to the test as she rallies her classmates to fight together to avoid being sold on the auction block in this new installment of the Bloody Jack Adventures.	528	October 1st 2006	Jacky Faber, James Emerson "Jaimy" Fletcher, John Higgins, Katy Deere, Amy Trevelyne, Ezra Pickering		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295650.In_the_Belly_of_the_Bloodhound
