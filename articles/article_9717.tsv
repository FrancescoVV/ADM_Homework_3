John Le Carré: Three Complete Novels [Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy / The Honourable Schoolboy / Smiley's People]	The Karla Trilogy #1-3	John le Carré	4.47	1027	58	Three complete, previously-issued novels, each a thrilling tale of espionage from the bestselling author of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold . Considered the father of the spy thriller, bestselling author John le Carré brings the daring deeds and intricate details of international espionage to center stage. His leading man is George Smiley, sometime acting chief of the Circus (as le Carré's secret service is known): a troubled man of infinite compassion, yet a single-mindedly ruthless adversary. Through these three enormously successful novels ( Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy , The Honourable Schoolboy , and Smiley's People ), Smiley stalks his opposite number, code-named Karla, the Soviet case officer who has been masterminding the Circus' ruin. The stage is a Cold War landscape of moles and lamplighters, scalp-hunters and pavement artists, where men are turned, burned, or bought.	952	1982	Peter Guillam, Bill Haydon, George Smiley, Jerry Westerby		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367679.John_Le_Carr_
