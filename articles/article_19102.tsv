The Revelations of August Barton	August Barton #2	Jennifer      LeBlanc	4.54	41	24	August Barton thought his tribulations were over, but some truths are hard to swallow. He’s been with Rose Varley for over a year, and has his heart set on taking the next step: a marriage proposal. He’s not prepared, however, for the obstacles that soon find their way into Augie’s life—tornadoes, drunken bachelorette parties, and an earth-shattering confession from his stepdad John are all trials Augie will need to overcome if he’s going to keep the girl. With his Grandma Gertie and mom off at a retreat in the Cayman Islands, the revelation Augie never prepared himself for was that, for once, he was going to have to figure it out all on his own.	178	June 30th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34857300-the-revelations-of-august-barton
