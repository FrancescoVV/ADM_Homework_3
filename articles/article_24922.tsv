Saving Seven (Book 1)		Flint Ory	4.92	13	3	Seven Murphy-Collins has never recovered after losing his mother to a drug overdose. He was abandoned and forced to bounce from foster family to foster family while the drug dealer responsible for her death went free. That same drug dealer also went by a different name: dad. Broke and hungry, Seven somehow manages to track his dad to St. Louis where revenge becomes even more difficult. There he comes face to face with death, drug lords and overzealous cops, but after all that his biggest challenge may be himself. Influenced by the good-hearted Southern belle that he loves and the scrappy hellion that he wants to hate, Seven must decide not only how he wants to punish the man that ruined his life, but who he wants to be.
