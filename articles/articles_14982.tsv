Nightwalker	Dark Days #1	Jocelynn Drake	3.68	9354	519	For centuries Mira has been a nightwalkerâ€”an unstoppable enforcer for a mysterious organization that manipulates earth-shaking events from the darkest shadows. But elemental mastery over fire sets her apart from others of her night-prowling breed . . . and may be all that prevents her doom. The foe she now faces is human: the vampire hunter called Danaus, who has already destroyed so many undead. For Mira, the time has come to hunt . . . or be hunted.	370	July 29th 2008	Mira, Danau	Savannah, Georgia (United States), London, England (United Kingdom), Egypt	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20564828-nightwalker
