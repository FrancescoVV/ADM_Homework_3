Where to go?" --Osho The Osho Life Essentials series focuses on the most important questions in the life of the individual. Each volume contains timeless and always-contemporary investigations and discussions into questions vital to our personal search for meaning and purpose, focusing on questions specific to our inner life and quality of existence. The first title in this dynamic and exciting new series, Destiny, Freedom, and the Soul: What Is the Meaning of Life? explores deeply human questions, such as: Is there really such a thing as "soul," and if so, what is it? Where does the concept of karma fit in? Does my life have a special meaning or purpose? Destiny, Freedom, and the Soul includes an original talk by Osho on DVD. This visual component enables the reader to experience the direct wisdom and humor of Osho straight from the source.	224	January 1st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7969618-destiny-freedom-and-the-soul
