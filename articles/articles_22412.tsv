Point of No Return	Turning Point #1	N.R. Walker	4.06	4000	559	This edition is no longer available. Matthew Elliot is one of LA's best detectives. He's been labelled the golden boy of the Fab Four; a team of four detectives who've closed down drug-rings all over the city. Heâ€™s smart, tough and exceptionally good at his job. He's also a closeted gay man. Enter Kira Takeo Franco, the new boxing coach at the gym. Matthew can't deny his immediate attraction to the man his fellow cops know as Frankie. But in allowing himself to fall in love with a man known to his colleagues, Matthew risks outing them both. Matt and Kira work to keep their relationship and private lives hidden from Matt's very public life, fearing it would be detrimental to their careers. But it's not the other cops who Matthew should be worried about finding out his deepest, darkest secret... it's the bad guys.	231	August 18th 2012	Kira Takeo Franco, Matthew Elliot	Los Angeles, California (United States), Claremont, California (United States), Wrightwood, California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26085125-point-of-no-return
