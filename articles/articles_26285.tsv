Rainbow Drive		Roderick Thorp	3.52	52	6	Decades after his father’s murder, a Los Angeles cop gets a chance to set things right Michael Gallagher is twelve years old when his father is hit by a speeding truck. While crusading for public housing, his father ran afoul of the city’s most corrupt politicians, and Michael is certain they were responsible for the crash. As his father is lowered into the ground, Michael vows vengeance—no matter how long it takes. Decades later, Michael, now a police officer, is awakened one night by gunfire. Outside his window, he sees helicopters and squad cars arriving at the scene of the crime. It’s a massive operation, but the next day, there is nothing about it in the logbooks. To learn what really happened that night, Michael descends into the black heart of Los Angeles, where he will learn the truth about his father—if he’s lucky enough to stay alive.	473	October 1986			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1014879.Rainbow_Drive
