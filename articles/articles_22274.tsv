Necessary Force	K-9 Rescue #0.5	D.D. Ayres	3.83	691	105	It was supposed to be a sexy calendar shoot to raise money for K-9 service dogs. Photographer Georgie Flynn never expected to break all her personal rules and jump into bed with one of the hunky men posing. And after their steamy night together, she certainly never expected to see him again…despite their powerful connection. When she's targeted by a stalker and possible bomber, Georgie finds that her gorgeous one-night stand is the only one who can help. Brad Lawson, an FBI operative, and his K-9 bomb sniffing partner are assigned to protect the pretty photographer--and this time, he’s determined to keep things professional. He just didn't count on their explosive connection rekindling. But with a deadly threat on the horizon, will he be able to keep his body’s demands in check and complete his mission?	100	July 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21531437-necessary-force
