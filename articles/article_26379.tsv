Death: The Time of Your Life	Death of the Endless #2	Neil Gaiman, Chris Bachalo, Mark Buckingham, Mark Pennington, Claire Danes	4.23	12809	225	Death incarnate, as defined by master storyteller Neil Gaiman (THE SANDMAN), is a genuinely likeable young girl with a fondness for ankhs who truly cares about people. It's small wonder then that when a rising star of the music world wrestles with revealing her true sexual orientation just as her lover is lured into the realm of Death that Death herself should make an appearance. A practical, honest, and intelligent story that illuminates "the miracle of death."	95	March 1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22339.Death
