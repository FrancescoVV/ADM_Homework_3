With his fondness for pink Chuck Taylors and New Wave hits aside, Jack's unlike anyone she's ever met. Then she meets his brother, Peter. His eyes pierce through her, and she can barely breathe when he's around. Even though he can't stand the sight of her, she's drawn to him. But falling for two very different guys isn't even the worst of her problems. Jack and Peter are vampires, and Alice finds herself caught between love and her own blood..	278	March 17th 2010	Alice Bonham, Milo Bonham, Peter Townsend, Jack Townsend (My Blood Approves), Ezra Townsend, Mae Townsend, Jane (My Blood Approves)	Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30123368-my-blood-approves
