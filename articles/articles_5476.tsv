Temptation	Temptation #1	Karen Ann Hopkins	3.77	1692	375	Two vastly different worlds. One forbidden love . . . An Amish boy. An English Girl. An impossible, forbidden love . . . Everyone told me I was making a mistake, but the heart wants what the heart wants, and my heart wanted Noah. We met and fell in love in the hidden fields and forests of Meadowview. If he was English or I was Amish, none of this would have happened. One of us had to make the sacrifice of leaving our culture to be together. As if the clash of our vastly different worlds wasnâ€™t enough, our small farming community had deeper troubles, and they might just be enough to tear us apart forever. Temptation is the compelling first book in a tension-filled series about star-crossed lovers struggling to be together against all odds.	383	June 26th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13223243-temptation
