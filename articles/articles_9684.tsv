The River of Wind	Guardians of Ga'Hoole #13	Kathryn Lasky	4.06	5428	75	Coryn, Soren and the Chaw of Chaws ride a river of wind to discover a realm of endless wonders where dwells a society of mysterious owls, the like of which has never before been seen. Meanwhile, journeying in the known kingdoms, Primrose and Eglantine stumble upon a plot by Nyra to kill the young king and his companions in a distant snowy land. Too late to get help from the tree, the young Guardians must find the strange new realm on their own to warm Coryn and the others. Even if they make it in time, will a handful of Guardians and peace-loving monks be a match for Pure Ones bent on murder?	202	January 1st 2007	Martin (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Ruby (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Digger (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Nyra, Primrose (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Soren (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Gylfie, Twilight (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Octavia (Guardians of Ga'Hoole), Mrs. Plithiver, Bubo, Madame Plonk, Otulissa, Nyroc/Coryn, Doc Finebeak, Bess (GoG'H), Striga, Tengshu, Pelli		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232647.The_River_of_Wind
