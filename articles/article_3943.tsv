The Contortionist's Handbook		Craig Clevenger	3.93	10578	491	John Vincent Dolan is a talented young forger with a proclivity for mathematics and drug addiction. In the face of his impending institutionalization, he continually reinvents himself to escape the legal and mental health authorities and to save himself from a life of incarceration. But running turns out to be costly. Vincent's clients in the L.A. underworld lose patience, the hospital evaluator may not be fooled by his story, and the only person in as much danger as himself is the woman who knows his real name.	199	2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/527823.The_Contortionist_s_Handbook
