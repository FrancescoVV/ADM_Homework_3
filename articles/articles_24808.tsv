Promethea: Book Two of the Groundbreaking New Series	Promethea #2	Alan Moore, J.H. Williams III, Mick Gray	4.08	4977	226	The second volume of the critically acclaimed, multiple award-winning series PROMETHEA is every bit as good as, if not better than, the first volume — and we don't make that statement lightly! This collection follows Sophie Bangs, the latest in a long line of Prometheas, on a winding journey of discovery as she continues to learn the secrets of the Immateria...and herself. Her transcendental adventure brings young Sophie to realms of magic and wonder that none have experienced before. Collecting PROMETHEA issues #7-12, this book contains such fan-favorite stories as "Rocks and Hard Places," where Sophie learns about the Promethea named Bill, and "Sex, Stars, and Serpents," where Sophie learns some… er… valuable lessons. Moore — the most lauded writer in the history of comics — and the fan-favorite art team of Williams & Gray combine their talents for a unique vision in comics that Entertainment Weekly has given an "A-" — describing the creative team as "seemingly hell-bent on reinventing the art of comics storytelling."	176	January 1st 2001	Promethea		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/325753.Promethea_Vol_2
