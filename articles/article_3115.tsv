Double Indemnity		James M. Cain	4.10	20519	1185	Tautly narrated and excruciatingly suspenseful, Double Indemnity gives us an X-ray view of guilt, of duplicity, and of the kind of obsessive, loveless love that devastates everything it touches. First published in 1935, this novel reaffirmed James M. Cain as a virtuoso of the roman noir .	115	1936	Walter Huff, Phyllis Nirdlinger, Barton Keyes		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56616.Double_Indemnity
