Sisters in Law		Sylvia Mulholland	4.50	6	2	Three women lawyers, each with very different personal lives and challenges, struggle to keep their firm afloat after a tragedy kills off most of the men. As the dust settles, they discover some startling truths about each other and, even more, the men they worked with for so long. A lingerie shower for the young law student about to marry the last male partner seems to the women like a healing and transformative cure for all that ails the firm. The party does not go off quite as planned, but it certainly does go off, with dramatic and often hilarious consequences.	229	July 21st 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40931099-sisters-in-law
