Renegades	Renegades #1	Marissa Meyer	4.15	63315	9939	Secret Identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice. The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone... except the villains they once overthrew. Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova's allegiance is to a villain who has the power to end them both.	556	November 7th 2017	Nova Artino, Adrian Everhart, Danna Bell, Ruby Tucker, Oscar Silva, Ingrid Thompson, Winston Pratt, Honey Harper, Leroy Flinn, Hugh Everhart, Simon Westwood, Kasumi Hasegawa, Tamaya Rae, Evander Wade, Max Everhart		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28421168-renegades
