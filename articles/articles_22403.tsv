A Deeper Shade of Red		Dominick Anderson	3.27	11	2	What happens when a simple mist brings seething horror? Or when a married couple considers murder to re-claim their lives, while the assassin they hire has his own plans of revenge? Even the police have their own bloody secrets, as do most residents in this small mountain town. Yet all evils seem to come together on a single night, as it's good versus evil in a final showdown where the only way out is to kill or be killed.	486	July 16th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19397891-a-deeper-shade-of-red
