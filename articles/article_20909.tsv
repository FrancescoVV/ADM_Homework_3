The Anything Box		Zenna Henderson	4.31	756	61	Don't open The Anything Box unless you're prepared for the unexpected. The Grunder, a thing of horror which, if defeated, restores love... The Noise-Eater, created by a child out of his fevered imagination, gobbles up anything--or anyone--that makes a sound... The Coveti, residents of an alien world poisoned by the intrusion of the stranger from Earth... The Beast Hill, an ordinary mound of earth, except that its grass resembles fur, and--doesn't it move?	191	October 1956			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/491887.The_Anything_Box
