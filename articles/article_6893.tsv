Vision in Silver	The Others #3	Anne Bishop	4.25	29372	2488	The Others freed the cassandra sangue to protect the blood prophets from exploitation, not realizing their actions would have dire consequences. Now the fragile seers are in greater danger than ever before; both from their own weaknesses and from those who seek to control their divinations for wicked purposes. In desperate need of answers, Simon Wolfgard, a shape-shifter leader among the Others, has no choice but to enlist blood prophet Meg Corbyn’s help, regardless of the risks she faces by aiding him. Meg is still deep in the throes of her addiction to the euphoria she feels when she cuts and speaks prophecy. She knows each slice of her blade tempts death. But Others and humans alike need answers, and her visions may be Simon’s only hope of ending the conflict. For the shadows of war are deepening across the Atlantik, and the prejudice of a fanatic faction is threatening to bring the battle right to Meg and Simon’s doorstep…	400	March 3rd 2015	Tess, Meg Corbyn, Vladimir Sanguinati, Steve Ferryman, Merri Lee, Simon Wolfgard, Henry Beargard, Crispin James Montgomery		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21457243-vision-in-silver
