Population: One: Autism, Adversity and the Will to Succeed		Tyler McNamer	3.76	235	30	Welcome to the world of Tyler McNamer, author of Population: One: Autism, Adversity and the Will to Succeed. Tyler named his book Population: One because he lives in his own world where his is the only resident. Yet, he knows that when individuals come together and learn from each other, they can form entire galaxies. Tyler's autism provides him with a unique perspective when viewing the world. He hopes his readers will "switch eyes" with him for a short time because only by seeing things from another's perspective can we come to understand and care about each other.	205	January 1st 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24158961-population
