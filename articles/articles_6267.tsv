After waiting for his big break, bad boy Cage York is finally called up to prove his worth in the college baseball arena. But when Cage’s girlfriend, Eva, mourns the sudden loss of her father, it’s not Cage’s comforting arms she runs to, but those of her former fiancé’s twin brother, Jeremy. Torn between his baseball dream and the girl of his dreams, Cage must prove he’s worthy of Eva’s love, or risk losing her to Jeremy forever.	288	August 26th 2013	Eva Brooks, Cage York, Willow Foster, Jeremy Beasley, Wilson Brooks	Sea Breeze, Alabama (United States), Hill State, Tennessee (United States), Rural South Alabama (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15828714-sometimes-it-lasts
