The War of the Worlds/The Invisible Man/The Time Machine		H.G. Wells	4.16	358	17	The Time Machine The Time Machine is generally credited with the popularisation of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. Wells also introduced the idea of time being the "fourth dimension". War of the Worlds This story is split into two parts, Book one: The Coming of the Martians, and Book two: The Earth under the Martians.The novel is narrated by a writer of philosophical articles who throughout the narrative struggles to reunite with his wife, while witnessing the Martians rampaging through the southern English counties. Part one also features the tale of his brother, who accompanies two women to the coast in the hope of escaping England as it is invaded. The Invisible Man The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who theorises that if a person's refractive index is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will be invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, becoming mentally unstable as a result.	283	January 1st 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7443853-the-time-machine-the-invisible-man-the-war-of-the-worlds
