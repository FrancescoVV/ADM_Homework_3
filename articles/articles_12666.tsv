Dark Symphony	Dark #9	Christine Feehan	4.18	16883	369	Blinded and scarred in a terrible accident, Antoinetta Scarletti made music that thrilled the world with its beauty and passion. Descended from a long line of psychics, Antoinetta has learned to rely on her other senses to “see” the world around her, but nothing could have prepared her for Byron. He came to her, drawn by her music, and became her secret obsession. Others fear him, sensing that he is dangerous—a predator—but for Antoinetta he is her ultimate fantasy, her dream lover. He woos her with kisses full of erotic allure, whispering that she is his light, his salvation. Byron has waited an eternity for her, and he will let nothing stand between him and the woman born to be his lifemate...	352	February 25th 2003	Byron Justiciano, Antonietta Nicoletta Scarletti, Nicoletta Scarletti, Don Giovanni Scarletti, Joie Sanders, Anton Scarletti, Dominic Dragonseeker, Franco Scarletti, Marita Scarletti, Stefan Demonesisni, Vlad Belendrake, Eleanor Belendrake		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/163294.Dark_Symphony
