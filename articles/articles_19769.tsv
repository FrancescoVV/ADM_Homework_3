Becket		Jean Anouilh, Lucienne Hill, André Aciman	3.99	1672	91	The celebrated play that draws from historical events in the Norman conquest of England to create a profound portrait of a man's soul—and a transcendent vision of the human spirit From its powerful opening scene, of a naked King Henry II praying at the tomb of Thomas Becket, to the final wrenching act of ultimate self-sacrifice, Jean Anouilh's Becket remains a towering achievement in the history of the theatre. Winner of the Antoinette Perry Award for Best Play of the Season, Anouilh's monumental work—introduced in this edition by the acclaimed writer and critic Andre Aciman—draws from historical events in the Norman conquest of England to paint a profound and enduring portrait of the saint and martyr.	144	1959	Thomas Becket, Henry II of England	London, England (United Kingdom), Canterbury, Kent, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106197.Becket
