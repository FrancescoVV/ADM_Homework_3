My Brilliant Friend	L'amica geniale #1	Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein	3.96	203303	18534	A modern masterpiece from one of Italy’s most acclaimed authors, My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense, and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante’s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. Growing up on these tough streets the two girls learn to rely on each other ahead of anyone or anything else. As they grow, as their paths repeatedly diverge and converge, Elena and Lila remain best friends whose respective destinies are reflected and refracted in the other. They are likewise the embodiments of a nation undergoing momentous change. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her protagonists, the unforgettable Elena and Lila.	331	October 19th 2011	Raffaella Cerullo (Lila), Elena Greco (Lenuccia), Stefano Carracci, Pasquale Peluso, Carmela Peluso, Ada Cappuccio, Antonio Cappuccio, Nino Sarratore, Enzo Scanno, Marcello Solara, Michele Solara, Rino Cerullo	Italy, Naples (Italy), Campania (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend
