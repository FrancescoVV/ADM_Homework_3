Sammy Keyes and the Art of Deception	Sammy Keyes #8	Wendelin Van Draanen	4.18	2038	82	Sammy Keyes has a lot of nerve. Wearing high-tops to a fancy reception at an art gallery. Asking why a framed orange splot is worth $10,000. Eyebrows rise. Noses turn up. But then Sammy tackles a thief who tries to break up the soiree with a stickup. Now the patrons of the arts are glad she has a lot of nerve. Or are they? Sammy may have stopped a criminal, but the real crime has yet to be discovered. The real crime is more subtle, more artful, than anything Sammy's ever seen. She had no idea art could be so dangerous. . . . This edition also includes a free cd including an interview with Wendelin, a reading from "Sammy Keyes and the Search for Snake Eyes," and "The Sammy Keyes Song."	288	April 8th 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1421769.Sammy_Keyes_and_the_Art_of_Deception
