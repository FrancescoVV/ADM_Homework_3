Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them	Hogwarts Library	Newt Scamander, J.K. Rowling	3.98	333139	10500	An approved textbook at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry since publication, Newt Scamander's masterpiece has entertained wizarding families through the generations. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an indispensable introduction to the magical beasts of the Wizarding World. Scamander's years of travel and research have created a tome of unparalleled importance. Some of the beasts will be familiar to readers of the Harry Potter books - the Hippogriff, the Basilisk, the Hungarian Horntail ... Others will surprise even the most ardent amateur Magizoologist. This is an essential companion to the Harry Potter stories, and includes a new foreword from J.K. Rowling (writing as Newt Scamander) and six new beasts!	128	March 1st 2001	Ron Weasley, Newt Scamander, Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41899.Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them
