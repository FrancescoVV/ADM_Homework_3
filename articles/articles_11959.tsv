Letter to a Christian Nation		Sam Harris	4.00	35549	1863	In response to The End of Faith , Sam Harris received thousands of letters from Christians excoriating him for not believing in God. Letter to A Christian Nation is his reply. Using rational argument, Harris offers a measured refutation of the beliefs that form the core of fundamentalist Christianity. In the course of his argument, he addresses current topics ranging from intelligent design and stem-cell research to the connections between religion and violence. In Letter to a Christian Nation , Sam Harris boldly challenges the influence that faith has on public life in our nation.	96	January 1st 2006	Charles Darwin, Mother Teresa		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51299.Letter_to_a_Christian_Nation
