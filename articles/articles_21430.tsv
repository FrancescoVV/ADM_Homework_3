Youth of the Apocalypse: And the Last True Rebellion		John Marler	4.06	52	6	A manifesto for the despairing children of the eleventh hour, this book deals with the issues that are tearing apart the fabric of innocence: suicide, insanity, drugs, violence, the occult, the apocalypse, and finally our salvation, suffering, and resurrection our of the depths of the modern wasteland. It offers a painfully honest appraisal of society form the perspective of the young who are hurt and in despair, and shows how many of their "punk values" become much more meaningful when viewed in the context of authentic Eastern Orthodox Christianity -- particularly within monasticism.	198	May 1st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/725699.Youth_of_the_Apocalypse
