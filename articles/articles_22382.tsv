Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul: The Pertinence of Islamic Cosmology in the Modern World		William C. Chittick	4.29	125	25	With academic courses either encouraging commercialism, or cultivating zealots, Chittick states that it is impossible to understand classical Islamic texts without the years of contemplative study that are anathema to the modern education system. Insisting upon a return to the ways of the ancient wisdom tradition, which saw the quest for knowledge of the soul, the world, and God as a unifying spiritual discipline, Chittick maintains that the study of Islamic texts cannot be treated separately from self-understanding. Fascinating, radical, and a true challenge to modern trends in academic study, this book opens a new debate in Islamic thought.	176	2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/315894.Science_of_the_Cosmos_Science_of_the_Soul
