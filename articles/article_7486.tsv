Excellent Women		Barbara Pym	3.92	11191	1639	Excellent Women is one of Barbara Pym's richest and most amusing high comedies. Mildred Lathbury is a clergyman's daughter and a mild-mannered spinster in 1950s England. She is one of those "excellent women," the smart, supportive, repressed women who men take for granted. As Mildred gets embroiled in the lives of her new neighbors--anthropologist Helena Napier and her handsome, dashing husband, Rocky, and Julian Malory, the vicar next door--the novel presents a series of snapshots of human life as actually, and pluckily, lived in a vanishing world of manners and repressed desires.	231	1952	Mildred Lathbury, Helena Napier, Rockingham Napier, Everard Bone, Julian Malory, Winifred Malory, Allegra Gray, Dora Caldicote, William Caldicote, Sister Blatt, Esther Clovis	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178565.Excellent_Women
