In Heaven as on Earth: A Vision of the Afterlife		M. Scott Peck	3.79	297	38	The best-selling author of The Road Less Traveled and In Search of Stones presents a novel of the afterlife that teaches important spiritual lessons for his life. The soul of Daniel - the author-psychiatrist who narrates this story - awakens in the afterlife infused with fear and excitement. Two spiritual "greeters" guide him as he begins to negotiate the "corridors" of this new environment, encountering welcome and unwelcome spirits. But ultimately only his own spiritual convictions and discoveries will lead him past seductive enchantment to the achievement of his destiny and an understanding of the fundamental moral principles that transcend mortality. Rich in lessons on finding a place and purpose in this life and beyond, Daniel's odyssey into eternity, like Dr. Peck's other inspirational classics, flows with nourishment for both the soul and the psyche.	240	March 3rd 1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1789979.In_Heaven_as_on_Earth
