The Top 10 of Everything 2007		Russell Ash	3.86	28	1	With annual sales of 200,000 copies, The Top 10 of Everything is clearly the place people go to get the lowdown on what or who was the best, worst, richest, fiercest, deadliest, or simply biggest of practically anything. It features 600 lists on a diverse range of subjects, from blockbuster movies and music to stellar universities, from crime and punishment to popular drinks. Find out which stars of stage and screen shone the brightest and which terrestrial animals weigh the most. See which habitable buildings are the tallest and which bodies are the largest in the solar system. Check out stats on airlines, crops, natural disasters, and sports. Some of the lists are entirely new; some are updated with the latest news, and all appear on attractively illustrated spreads with excellent background information. “First” and “Fast” fact boxes pinpoint the pioneers and the most recent achievers in various endeavors. It’s entertaining and educational!	256	October 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/539181.The_Top_10_of_Everything_2007
