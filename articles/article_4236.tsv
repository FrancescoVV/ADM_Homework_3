Musical Chairs		Jen Knox	4.04	314	99	Musical Chairs explores one family's history of mental health diagnoses and searches to define the cusp between a '90s working-class childhood and the trouble of adapting to a comfortable life in the suburbs. In order to understand her restlessness, Jennifer reflects on years of strip-dancing, alcoholism, and estrangement. Inspired by the least likely source, the family she left behind, Jennifer struggles towards reconciliation. This story is about identity, class, family ties, and the elusive nature of mental illness.	176	October 3rd 2009	Elena Kyler, Irene, Roseanne, Maggie, Wallace, Elida	Ohio (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6901097-musical-chairs
