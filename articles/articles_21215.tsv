In Enchanting Love, the lead character Regina is not your average girl; she has been on both sides of the track. After a chance meeting with Priscilla Marshall who presented her with new opportunities, God changed her life. Her main desire was no longer finding a man, but instead thirsting after God, building her business, and being a new person in Christ. Dinner with her bestie, news of a new baby, and a chance meeting with an undercover waiter at La'Shelle's restaurant, now challenged all of that. She was now second-guessing the place she had grown comfortable. Did she really want more? Was she ready to release God's hands concerning her love life? Could she finally have a desire to be a wife and mother? These were all questions Regina now faced. Nathan Stallone Jr. was certainly not looking for a wife, but when he laid eyes on Regina, he knew she was wife material. Now his only question was if he was ready and willing to alter his life to become a part of hers. Nevertheless, life would throw them both a curve that could potentially cause their faith to waver. Would they endure the test? Would this be the captivating, enthralling, delightful ~ Enchanting Love~ they both dreamed about? Find out just how God moves when we allow Him to be in control of our lives in Enchanting Love.					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42612771-enchanting-love
