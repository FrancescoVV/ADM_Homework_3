Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege, 1942–1943		Antony Beevor	4.31	28487	1017	The Battle of Stalingrad was not only the psychological turning point of World War II: it also changed the face of modern warfare. Historians and reviewers worldwide have hailed Antony Beevor's magisterial Stalingrad as the definitive account of World War II's most harrowing battle. In August 1942, Hitler's huge Sixth Army reached the city that bore Stalin's name. In the five-month siege that followed, the Russians fought to hold Stalingrad at any cost; then, in an astonishing reversal, encircled and trapped their Nazi enemy. This battle for the ruins of a city cost more than a million lives. Stalingrad conveys the experience of soldiers on both sides, fighting in inhuman conditions, and of civilians trapped on an urban battlefield. Antony Beevor has interviewed survivors and discovered completely new material in a wide range of German and Soviet archives, including prisoner interrogations and reports of desertions and executions. As a story of cruelty, courage, and human suffering, Stalingrad is unprecedented and unforgettable.	494	July 1st 1998	Joseph Stalin, Hermann Göring, Friedrich Paulus, Georgy Zhukov, Erich von Manstein, Vasily Grossman, Nikita Khrushchev, Lavrentiy Beria, Adolf Hitler, Vasily Chuikov, Alexander Edler von Daniels, Helmuth Groscurth, Hans-Valentin Hube, Hermann Hoth, Andrey Yeryomenko	Volgograd (Russian Federation), Stalingrad, USSR, Soviet Union	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542389.Stalingrad
