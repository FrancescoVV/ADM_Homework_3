WITHIN THE EMPIRE THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS, ONLY ORDERS. Elias, Helene and Tavi are Fivers --in training to become elite military recruits for the Martial Empire at Blackcliff Academy. When theyâ€™re sent on a dangerous mission to steal a heavily-guarded poison on Isle South, they soon find themselves up against surprising enemies -- including other recruits. As the true horror of their assignment is revealed, these three will begin to confront the harrowing realities of Martial rule, their place in the system . . . and the choices they must make to survive. New York Times bestselling author Sabaa Tahir joins writer Nicole Andelfinger and artist Sonia Liao for an all-new original graphic novel revealing an early tale of Elias and Helene at Blackcliff, and a stirring standalone chapter in the An Ember in the Ashes mythology.	144	July 14th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52758336-a-thief-among-the-trees
