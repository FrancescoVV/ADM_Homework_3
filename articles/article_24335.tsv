In this second installment of the Primani series, the Primani are bombarded by shadowy enemies who threaten everything they know. When Mica is targeted, all hell breaks loose. Desperate to save her life, Killian pulls Mica into his private world of altars and blood. His intentions were honorable, but his secrets could destroy them both. When Killian takes over her training, Mica's mysterious powers evolve in a stunning new direction. Determined to learn control, she's unaware of the unseen eyes watching her every movement. But as the body count grows, she can't ignore the terrifying truth any longer. As the Primani struggle to destroy their personal demons, humans go about their business while a terrifying fate is hatching in the tunnels under their feet.	448	September 23rd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18604079-call-the-lightning
