Extraordinary Means		Robyn Schneider	3.95	16829	2387	When he's sent to Latham House, a boarding school for sick teens, Lane thinks his life may as well be over. But when he meets Sadie and her friends - a group of eccentric troublemakers - he realises that maybe getting sick is just the beginning. That illness doesn't have to define you, and that falling in love is its own cure.	336	May 26th 2015	Lane Rosen, Sadie Bennett	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23149128-extraordinary-means
