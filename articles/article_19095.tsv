A Life Once Lived		Tracy Dale	4.75	4	0	Waverly Jones is always game to try something new. But, when she tries her hand at sailing, and instead finds herself falling into a vortex in the middle of the ocean, death seems certain. Yet somehow, she lands at the foot of a strange woman, two-hundred years before her time, who insists she become a part of the English society she’s now in. Attending balls, house parties, and meeting curious visitors suddenly become a part of the life she must live, and with her good humor and funny mannerisms, she charms more than a few. Yet her secret determination to return home never wavers. Until she discovers there’s an assassin tasked with getting rid of her if she tries. Forced to make choices she never dreamed of, she escapes on a ship bound to the Americas with a sea captain that has far more secrets than she ever imagined. As their unusual friendship grows, Waverly must survive the dangers that continue to follow her, and find her way in a time and place that’s not her own. ***Amusing, mysterious and romantic, A Life Once Lived is an epic adventure that takes you on an exciting journey across an ever-changing landscape in time.	431	May 15th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36463950-a-life-once-lived
