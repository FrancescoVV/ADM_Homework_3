Leonardo, the Terrible Monster	Leonardo #1	Mo Willems	4.18	13367	700	Leonardo is truly a terrible monster--terrible at being a monster that is. No matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to frighten anyone. Determined to succeed, Leonardo sets himself to training and research. Finally, he finds a nervous little boy, and scares the tuna salad out of him! But scaring people isn't quite as satisfying as he thought it would be. Leonardo realizes that he might be a terrible, awful monster--but he could be a really good friend.	48	August 2nd 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/624744.Leonardo_the_Terrible_Monster
