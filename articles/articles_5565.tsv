Spoon River Anthology		Edgar Lee Masters	4.04	9267	699	From spoonriveranthology.net: "Edgar Lee Masters's Spoon River Anthology was an immediate commercial success when it was published in 1915. Unconventional in both style and content, it shattered the myths of small town American life. A collection of epitaphs of residents of a small town, a full understanding of Spoon River requires the reader to piece together narratives from fragments contained in individual poems."	112	1915		Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/292668.Spoon_River_Anthology
