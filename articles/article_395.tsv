The Hunchback of Notre-Dame		Victor Hugo, Walter J. Cobb	3.99	172467	5021	This extraordinary historical novel, set in Medieval Paris under the twin towers of its greatest structure and supreme symbol, the cathedral of Notre-Dame, is the haunting drama of Quasimodo, the hunchback; Esmeralda, the gypsy dancer; and Claude Frollo, the priest tortured by the specter of his own damnation. Shaped by a profound sense of tragic irony, it is a work that gives full play to Victor Hugo's brilliant historical imagination and his remarkable powers of description.	510	January 14th 1831	Quasimodo (Victor Hugo), Claude Frollo, Esmeralda, Gringoire, Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers	Paris (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30597.The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame
