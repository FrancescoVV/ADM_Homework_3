Crazy For Love		Tahnee Fritz	3.91	11	1	Colton never thought he’d have to be afraid of anything. With a sheriff for a father, the fear should have been drove right out of him. Instead, he’s forced to watch his back, knowing the black car will forever be in his rearview mirror. He jumps at the sound of his cell phone, afraid to answer to the red headed beauty who only wants to hear his voice. Moving back home with his parents should have made his life easier. He never expected a stranger to fall hopelessly in love with so soon.	282	April 21st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22007080-crazy-for-love
