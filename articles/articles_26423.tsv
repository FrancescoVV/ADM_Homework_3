Clouds of Witness	Lord Peter Wimsey #2	Dorothy L. Sayers	4.01	17958	1163	Rustic old Riddlesdale Lodge was a Wimsey family retreat filled with country pleasures and the thrill of the hunt -- until the game turned up human and quite dead. He lay among the chrysanthemums, wore slippers and a dinner jacket and was Lord Peter's brother-in-law-to-be. His accused murderer was Wimsey's own brother, and if murder set all in the family wasn't enough to boggle the unflappable Lord Wimsey, perhaps a few twists of fate would be -- a mysterious vanishing midnight letter from Egypt...a grieving fiancee with suitcase in hand...and a bullet destined for one very special Wimsey.	288	1926	Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey, Gerald, Duke of Denver, Helen, Duchess of Denver, The Honorable Freddy Arbuthnot, Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Inspector Sugg, Lady Mary Parker, Honoria Lucasta, Dowager Duchess of Denver		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192888.Clouds_of_Witness
