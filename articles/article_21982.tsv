Who Has Seen the Wind		W.O. Mitchell	3.87	3975	167	When W.O. Mitchell died in 1998, he was described as "Canada's best-loved writer." Every commentator agreed that his best—and his best-loved—book was Who Has Seen the Wind . Since it was first published in 1947, this book has sold almost a million copies in Canada. As we enter the world of four-year-old Brian O'Connal, his father the druggist, his Uncle Sean, his mother, and his formidable Scotch grandmother ("she belshes … a lot"), it soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary book. As we watch Brian grow up, the prairie and its surprising inhabitants like the Ben and Saint Sammy—and the rich variety of small-town characters—become unforgettable. This book will be a delightful surprise for all those who are aware of it, but have never quite got around to reading it, till now.	352	1947		Canadian Prairies (Canada), Saskatchewan (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1538543.Who_Has_Seen_the_Wind
