The Case of the Vanishing Boy		Alexander Key	4.11	166	17	His memory gone, a mysterious youth knows only one thing: It’s time to run On a crowded commuter train, a young boy shakes with fear, unable to remember how he got there or where he’s going. His memory is a total blank. He doesn’t even know his name. But beside him is a blind girl, Ginny, who has a way of seeing deep within people’s souls. Looking inside the boy’s addled memory, she discovers that his name is Jan—and he has every reason to be afraid. When the train stops, Jan flees into the night, and the police come charging after him. No matter where he goes—a church, the woods, the back alleys of this cozy suburban town—the hunters keep getting closer. He has incredible powers, and the government wants to use them for evil purposes. As his memory returns, Jan will tame his powers and stop running. With Ginny’s help, he will begin to fight back.
