Dear and Glorious Physician		Taylor Caldwell	4.31	6288	394	Today St. Luke is known as the author of the third Gospel of the New Testament, but two thousand years ago he was Lucanus, a Greek, a man who loved, knew the emptiness of bereavement, and later traveled through the hills and wastes of Judea asking, "What manner of man was my Lord?" And it is of this Lucanus that Taylor Caldwell tells here in one of the most stirring stories ever lived or written.	560	1958	St. Luke, Lucanus, Jesus		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59097.Dear_and_Glorious_Physician
