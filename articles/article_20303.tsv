Darkness Visible		William Golding	3.37	1717	100	A dazzlingly dark novel by the Nobel Laureate. At the height of the London blitz, a naked child steps out of an all-consuming fire. Miraculously saved yet hideously scarred, tormented at school and at work, Matty becomes a wanderer, a seeker after some unknown redemption. Two more lost children await him: twins as exquisite as they are loveless. Toni dabbles in political violence, Sophy in sexual tyranny. As Golding weaves their destinies together, as he draws them toward a final conflagration, his book lights up both the inner and outer darknesses of our time.	272	1979			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/249043.Darkness_Visible
