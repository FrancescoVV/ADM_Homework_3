The Time in Between		María Dueñas, Daniel Hahn	4.12	29459	3438	The Time In Between is a word-of-mouth phenomenon that catapulted María Dueñas, a debut author, to the top of Spain's bestseller lists. This sweeping novel, which combines the storytelling power of The Shadow of the Wind with the irresistible romance of Casablanca , moves at an unstoppable pace. Suddenly left abandoned and penniless in Morocco by her lover, Sira Quiroga forges a new identity. Against all odds she becomes the most sought-after couture designer for the socialite wives of German Nazi officers. But she is soon embroiled in a dangerous political conspiracy as she passes information to the British Secret Service through a code stitched into the hems of her dresses.	615	June 2009	Jamila, Felix, Sira Quiroga, Marcus Logan, Rosalinda Fox, Juan Luis Beigbeder, Manuel Da Silva, Candelaria "Matutera", Peter Fox, Ramiro Arribas, Vázquez		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836813-the-time-in-between
