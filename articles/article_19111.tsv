The Pioni Affair		Andy James	4.50	2	0	Riviera yacht broker Jonti Kershaw and his captain find a hoard of Mafia dollars on the motor vessel Mia Amigo and decide to split the cash. But Signor Pazzano wants the money and his honour back and launches a traditional mob vendetta against Jonti, an unassuming Englishman who finds himself dragged deeper and deeper into a world of misplaced honour and violence. Andy James' taut, insightful thriller switches from the Cote d'Azur to Corsica and finally to the tiny Italian prison island of Pioni where only the daring rescue of a convicted mobster will be enough to save Jonti from Pazzano and his henchmen.	276	August 27th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14447216-the-pioni-affair
