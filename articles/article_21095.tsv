Sharon Osbourne Extreme: My Autobiography		Sharon Osbourne, Penelope Dening	3.84	2953	202	As the daughter of notorious rock manager Don Arden, Sharon Osbourne's childhood was an unruly mix of glamour and violence. In her late 20s, Sharon finally made the painful decision to break with her family. Always irrepressible, Sharon flourished, creating a loving family of her own while becoming a legendary manager and rockband promoter. In rock star Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon found her soul mate, yet Ozzy's drug and drink-fuelled excesses which culminated in his attempt to strangle her made their marriage a white knuckle ride from the start; only her devotion to their three children gave her the will to survive. From the tremendous highs of the hit show The Osbournes to the lows of Ozzy's near-fatal quad-bike accident and her own bout with colon cancer, Sharon's tenacity, honesty, and humour have triumphed again and again.	365	October 3rd 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119822.Sharon_Osbourne_Extreme
