Lady Luck	Colorado Mountain #3	Kristen Ashley	4.42	36148	2221	Is love in the cards? Since birth, Lexie Berry has had nothing but bad luck. Orphaned at an early age, she had a rough childhood and a boyfriend who was murdered. Now the beautiful, stylish Lexie is determined to change her luck and her life. But first she's got to make good on a promise: to pick up Ty Walker from prison. One look at the gorgeous ex-convict and Lexie knows she's in trouble-and already thinking about taking a walk on the wild side . . . For five years, Ty was imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. Now he wants revenge on the people who framed him. Yet when the high-stakes poker player sees the leggy Lexie, he suddenly has other desires on his mind. Realizing that Ty is innocent, Lexie tries to stop his plan for vengeance and help him become a better man. But as Ty battles his inner demons, dirty cops and criminals plot to take him out. Can he and Lexie find a way to escape the past?	535	October 22nd 2011	Tyrell "Ty" Walker, Alexa "Lexie" Berry, Tatum "Tate" Jackson, Lauren Grahame, Nina Sheridan, Holden "Max" Maxwell, Faye Goodknight, Chace Keaton	Carnal, Colorado (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12958487-lady-luck
