The Three Musketeers	The D'Artagnan Romances #1	Alexandre Dumas	4.07	274911	6834	Alexandre Dumas’s most famous tale— and possibly the most famous historical novel of all time— in a handsome hardcover volume. This swashbuckling epic of chivalry, honor, and derring-do, set in France during the 1620s, is richly populated with romantic heroes, unattainable heroines, kings, queens, cavaliers, and criminals in a whirl of adventure, espionage, conspiracy, murder, vengeance, love, scandal, and suspense. Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d’Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress “Milady”; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen—and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto “all for one, one for all” has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, The Three Musketeers is eternally entertaining.	625	March 1844	D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, Cardinal Richelieu, King Louis XIII, Anne of Austria, Milady de Winter, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Monsieur de Treville	Paris (France), La Rochelle (France), France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7190.The_Three_Musketeers
