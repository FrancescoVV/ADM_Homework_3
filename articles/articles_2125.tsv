One Grave at a Time	Night Huntress #6	Jeaniene Frost	4.23	44615	2178	How do you send a killer to the grave when he’s already dead? Having narrowly averted an (under)World War, Cat Crawfield wants nothing more than a little downtime with her vampire husband, Bones. Unfortunately, her gift from New Orleans’s voodoo queen just keeps on giving—leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit. Centuries ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity—forever. But one wrong step and they’ll be digging their own graves.	358	August 30th 2011	Denise MacGregor, Bones (Night Huntress series), Catherine Crawfield-Russell, Spade (Night Huntress series), Tate Bradley, Don Williams, Ian Flannery	Garland, Texas (United States), Blue Ridge Mountains (United States), Washington, D.C.
