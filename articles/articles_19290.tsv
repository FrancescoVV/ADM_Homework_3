The Gifted	The Daegmon War #1	Matthew Dickerson	4.00	28	13	The Daegmon War is a three-- volume fantasy novel beginning with The Gifted , continuing with The Betrayed , and ending with The Mountain . The centuries-- old war against the Daegmon Lord has been dormant for generations and knowledge of the Gifts (powers of healing, of supernatural knowledge, and of strength over demonic foes) has faded into dim folklore. When one of the Daegmons suddenly returns to wage war against the All-- Maker and his people, only one small band, led by a young Westwash woman named Elynna and an Andani hunter--guide, rises up against the terrible foe. But they are few, and only a handful of them number among the Gifted. When their own king and his armies turn against the them, all seems lost for the company. Only Thimeonâ€™s faith in the All-- Maker and in the Holy Mountain sustains the faithfulfew.	448	August 29th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21864397-the-gifted
