The Magicians' Guild	The Black Magician Trilogy #1	Trudi Canavan	3.94	73117	2653	"We should expect this young woman to be more powerful than our average novice, possibly even more powerful than the average magician." This year, like every other, the magicians of Imardin gather to purge the city of undesirables. Cloaked in the protection of their sorcery, they move with no fear of the vagrants and miscreants who despise them and their work-â€”until one enraged girl, barely more than a child, hurls a stone at the hated invaders...and effortlessly penetrates their magical shield. What the Magicians' Guild has long dreaded has finally come to pass. There is someone outside their ranks who possesses a raw power beyond imagining, an untrained mage who must be found and schooled before she destroys herself and her city with a force she cannot yet control.	467	2001	Sonea, Rothen, Akkarin	Kyralia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28249.The_Magicians_Guild
