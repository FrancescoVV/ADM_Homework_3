THE DIARY OF A CANADIAN NOBODY: The diary of a Mr. Nobody and how the war on terror affects his modern family		Arthur Paul James	4.21	63	2	It's September 2001 and Arthur Lakelady is a man beset by worries. It seems that his wife, Alys, is infatuated with the home renovator who is working on their new kitchen. His daughter, Gwen, is doing well at school, although with pass marks that often exceed 100%, he worries that her school doesn’t grasp the meaning of percentage. Meanwhile, his son, Lance, might never pass another exam ever again, if he doesn’t soon give up sports. These worries are soon put into perspective when Arthur’s Canadian employer is taken over by Americans and they replace the local executives in an attempt to introduce their own initiatives. As the world changes around him and he is expected to lead a team at work, Arthur hires a young temp, Lydia, to help him. But Lydia only adds to his worry, with her desire to get as up close and personal with him as possible. And when the madness of the world spills over and thousands are killed in the World Trade Center attack, Arthur looks at the state of the planet and sees that it needs someone who can clear the confusion, make the complex simple and package it into manageable pieces. It needs a diarist. And right now, the nobody who is Arthur Lakelady, might one day become a somebody in the mold of Samuel Pepys. Review "This book is both funny and moving. One page you might laugh out loud, the next you might be in tears. This is the story of a modern family living their everyday lives, and how the war on terror affects them. We need more stories like this: raw, unfiltered, realistic, even showing the messiness of life and all." -Ashley Emma, bestselling author of Undercover Amish, Fearless Author, and the Ashley's Amish Adventures Series	273	December 15th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34610437-the-diary-of-a-canadian-nobody
