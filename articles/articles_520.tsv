The Woman in White		Wilkie Collins, Matthew Sweet	3.99	132537	7632	'In one moment, every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop... There, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth, stood the figure of a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white' The Woman in White famously opens with Walter Hartright's eerie encounter on a moonlit London road. Engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie, Walter becomes embroiled in the sinister intrigues of Sir Percival Glyde and his 'charming' friend Count Fosco, who has a taste for white mice, vanilla bonbons, and poison. Pursuing questions of identity and insanity along the paths and corridors of English country houses and the madhouse, The Woman in White is the first and most influential of the Victorian genre that combined Gothic horror with psychological realism. Matthew Sweet's introduction explores the phenomenon of Victorian 'sensation' fiction, and discusses Wilkie Collins's biographical and societal influences. Included in this edition are appendices on theatrical adaptations of the novel and its serialisation history.	672	November 26th 1859	Walter Hartright, Marian Halcombe, Anne Catherick, Sir Percival Glyde, Count Fosco, Frederick Fairlie, Laura Fairlie, Madame Fosco, Mr. Gilmore	Cumberland, England, London, England (United Kingdom), Hampshire, England, England United Kingdom, England, United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5890.The_Woman_in_White
