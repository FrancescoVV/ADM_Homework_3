Katbamna, tells the powerful story of a brave few who venture for truth in the aftermath of a global uprising. In the year 2027, society has fallen. Mass revolts and warring nations have claimed countless lives and destroyed vast lands. Forced into a dark slumber, the world now draws fewer breaths and hosts infinite graveyards. In England, ten survivors who have journeyed many miles are on a path ready to converge. With histories soaked in the blood of betrayal, lies and deceit, one common thread binds them. The human instinct to seek a greater truth. Over six days, these ten souls will come to find that the ruined world around them is reawakening. As a presence emerges, bringing with it a merciless intention to eliminate any and all beating bodies, this company of strangers will confront a series of hardships in a tale of underdogs, oppressors and the human condition. Down and Rising is an immersive reading experience. An imaginative multi-story arc intricately woven together by striking imagery, reference materials and finely crafted characters.	676	January 12th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42794237-down-and-rising
