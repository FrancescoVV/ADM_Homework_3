White Horses		Alice Hoffman	3.40	1694	170	Teresa grew up with dreams of dark-eyed fearless heroes on white horses who would one day come to rescue her. The men her mother told her about were a special breed – rules didn’t apply to them or to her brother, Silver. Their intense attachment becomes the stuff of nightmares rather than fairytales. In a dangerous world, Teresa must rescue herself and rewrite her family mythology before it ruins her life.	305	1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39696988-white-horses
