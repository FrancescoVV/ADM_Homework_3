The Rootless		Angelo Tsanatelis	4.29	31	3	He appeared seemingly out of nowhere. They were calling him, the Rootless, because he wasn't a member of the Tribe, although he was almost like them. He traveled alone, with no clear plan and a voice in his head that was always there, a remnant of a distant and forgotten past. This story is set in the same universe as the Living Sword Chronicles 2nd Edition	0	April 26th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11447962-the-rootless
