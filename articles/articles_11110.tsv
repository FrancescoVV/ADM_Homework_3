Caddie Woodlawn	Caddie Woodlawn #1	Carol Ryrie Brink	4.00	48245	1462	Caddie Woodlawn is a real adventurer. She'd rather hunt than sew and plow than bake, and tries to beat her brother's dares every chance she gets. Caddie is friends with Indians, who scare most of the neighbors -- neighbors who, like her mother and sisters, don't understand her at all. Caddie is brave, and her story is special because it's based on the life and memories of Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother, the real Caddie Woodlawn. Her spirit and sense of fun have made this book a classic that readers have taken to their hearts for more than seventy years.	288	1935		Wisconsin (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205821.Caddie_Woodlawn
