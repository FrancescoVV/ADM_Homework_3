Hometown Girl Again	Hometown #5	Kirsten Fullmer	4.24	779	55	How did I end up so frustrated? It’s a question Katherine asks herself every day. First, a surprise inheritance tipped her life upside-down, and now her new RV park is a muddy mess of half-restored trailers. To make matters worse, she’s falling for her first crush all over again. The only thing she’s sure of at this point is a full-blown identity crisis. Alex came home after a life-threatening wound ended his Army career. Now Katie is back too, and she’s building something called a glamping park? He feels like he let her down years ago, can he make it up to her now? Or are his own problems too much to handle? Fate brought Katherine and Alex back to Smithville, and the town-folk want to see them together again.
