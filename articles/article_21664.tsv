The Anatomy of Peace: Resolving the Heart of Conflict		The Arbinger Institute	4.27	9898	1617	Written as an engaging story, this book shows how mistaken views can cause people to misread situations and exacerbate the issues they wish to improve. Arguing that it is only after they understand themselves and get their internal house in order that they can correctly confront external conflicts, the book shows what can be done to make that happen, and how to make inner peace a potent tool for achieving outer satisfaction.	231	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25480369-the-anatomy-of-peace
