The Judgement	Ruin #3	Lucian Bane	4.29	262	60	Ruin wakes up on Earth knowing only one thing: to Judge and Execute. As an Angel of Judgment with no memory of his origins and no ability to communicate, he seeks help from Isadore, the first human he comes into contact with. Without realizing, he binds molecularity with the OCD Neuroscientist, and slowly becomes permanently attached to her. But, there is a mission he's sent to accomplish and it isn't about Isadore. Or is it? Something about the eccentric and beautiful woman seems to be preventing him from remembering what he must do in order to complete his task on Earth. In the breathtaking third book of the Ruin Series, The Judgment, Ruin tackles missions designed to bring him face to face with the answers he desperately needs. Soon, however, he discovers that the clues he gains to unravel the mysteries of his mission will declare war on his heart and soul.	106	October 24th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23343397-the-judgement
