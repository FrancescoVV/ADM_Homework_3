No Safety in Numbers	No Safety in Numbers #1	Dayna Lorentz	3.55	6153	881	When a strange device is discovered in the air ducts of a busy suburban mall, the entire complex is suddenly locked down. No one can leave. No one knows what is going on. At first, there's the novelty of being stuck in a mega mall with free food and a gift certificate. But with each passing day, it becomes harder to ignore the dwindling supplies, inadequate information, and mounting panic. Then people start getting sick. Told from the point of view of two guys and two girls, this is a harrowing look at what can happen under the most desperate of circumstances, when regular people are faced with impossible choices. Some rise to the occasion. Some don't. And for some - it's too late.	263	May 2012	Marco (No Safety in Numbers), Mike Richter, Drew Bonner, Lexi Ross, Arthur Ross, Dorothy "Dotty" Ross, Ginger Franklin, Maddie Flynn, Ryan Murphy, Shaila "Shay" Dixit, Preeti Dixit		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12971664-no-safety-in-numbers
