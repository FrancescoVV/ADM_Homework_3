Flirt	Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #18	Laurell K. Hamilton	3.73	32614	1198	When Anita Blake meets with prospective client Tony Bennington, who is desperate to have her reanimate his recently deceased wife, she is full of sympathy for his loss. Anita knows something about love, and she knows everything there is to know about loss. But what she also knows, though Tony Bennington seems unwilling to be convinced, is that the thing she can do as a necromancer isn't the miracle he thinks he needs. The creature that Anita could coerce to step out of the late Mrs. Bennington's grave would not be the lovely Mrs. Bennington. Not really. And not for long.	192	February 2nd 2009	Anita Blake, Jason Schuyler, Nathaniel Graison, Micah Callahan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6726595-flirt
