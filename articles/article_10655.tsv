The corpse of a millionaire collecting antiques is found in New York on the eve of a major auction. The last thing he saw in the darkness seconds before his death was a certain Man-With-No-Face. Is it a man or a ghost? Is he capable of causing paralyzing fear and death by his appearance? Is he the embodiment of Chimera, the ancient Greek monster? Following in the tracks of the Man-With-No-Face the detective finds out about the stolen precious locket and a secret project under the codename "Chimera". How are these connected?
