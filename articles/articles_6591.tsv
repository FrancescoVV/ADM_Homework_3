The Taker	The Taker Trilogy #1	Alma Katsu	3.67	7179	1257	True love can last an eternity . . . but immortality comes at a price. . . . On the midnight shift at a hospital in rural St. Andrew, Maine, Dr. Luke Findley is expecting a quiet evening--until a mysterious woman, Lanore McIlvrae, arrives in his ER, escorted by police. Lanore is a murder suspect, and Luke is inexplicably drawn to her. As Lanny tells him her story, an impassioned account of love and betrayal that transcends time and mortality, she changes his life forever. At the turn of the nineteenth century, Lanny was consumed as a child by her love for the son of St. Andrewâ€™s founder, and she will do anything to be with him forever, but the price she pays is steep--an immortal bond that chains her to a terrible fate.	438	April 14th 2011	Lanore McIlvrae, Luke Findley, Jonathan St. Andrew, Adair	Maine (United States), Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7766064-the-taker
