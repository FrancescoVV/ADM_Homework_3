Opal	Lux #3	Jennifer L. Armentrout	4.29	124691	9339	No one is like Daemon Black. When he set out to prove his feelings for me, he wasn’t fooling around. Doubting him isn’t something I’ll do again, and now that we’ve made it through the rough patches, well… There’s a lot of spontaneous combustion going on. But even he can’t protect his family from the danger of trying to free those they love. After everything, I’m no longer the same Katy. I’m different… And I’m not sure what that will mean in the end. When each step we take in discovering the truth puts us in the path of the secret organization responsible for torturing and testing hybrids, the more I realize there is no end to what I’m capable. The death of someone close still lingers, help comes from the most unlikely source, and friends will become the deadliest of enemies, but we won’t turn back. Even if the outcome will shatter our worlds forever. Together we’re stronger… and they know it.	394	December 11th 2012	Daemon Black, Blake Saunders, Dawson Black, Bethany Williams, Adam Thompson, Luc (Lux Series), Katy Swartz, Dee Black, Andrew Thompson, Ash Thompson, Matthew Garrison	West Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13362536-opal
