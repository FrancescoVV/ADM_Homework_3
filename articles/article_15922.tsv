Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE, Vol. 10	Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE #10	CLAMP, William Flanagan	4.29	2906	48	TIME WILL TELL The godlike being Ashura-ô has killed the equally skilled and mighty rival, Yasha-ô. But now Ashura-ô seems depressed. What this means to the country of Shura, none can tell...not even the five friends on a desperate journey through dimensions to find the memories of Princess Sakura - memories in the form of immensely powerful feathers. The five have been racing from world to world, separated and then pitted against one another as enemies. Now young Syaoran is at the center of the maelstrom - and only wits, luck, and some help from his friends will save the tiny band from destruction.	184	May 17th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13571.Tsubasa
