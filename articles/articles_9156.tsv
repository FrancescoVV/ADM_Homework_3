The Hunt for Atlantis	Nina Wilde & Eddie Chase #1	Andy McDermott	3.90	13740	780	Following in the tradition of Clive Cussler and Matthew Reilly, Andy McDermott takes us a roller-coaster ride in search of the legendary Atlantis. Archaeologist Nina Wilde believes she has found the location of the lost city of Atlantis and now she wants the opportunity to prove her theory. Someone else though wants her dead! With the help of ex-SAS bodyguard Eddie Chase and beautiful heiress Kari Frost, Nina faces a breakneck race against time around the world, pursued at every step by agents of the mysterious - and murderous - Brotherhood of Selasphoros. From the jungles of Brazil to the mountains of Tibet, from the streets of Manhattan to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, the hunt for Atlantis leads to a secret hidden for 11,000 years - which in the wrong hands could destroy civilization as we know it...	538	August 25th 2007	Nina Wilde, Kari Frost, Kristian Frost, Giovanni Qobras, Eddie Chase, Jonathan Philby	Iran, Norway, Brazil	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2445116.The_Hunt_for_Atlantis
