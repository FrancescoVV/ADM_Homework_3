Switch! The Lost Kingdoms of Karibu	Lost Kingdoms of Karibu #1	Karen  Prince	4.14	472	73	Trouble is brewing in Karibu and Gogo Maya and her leopard are about to make matters worse. Their risky ‘switching’ trick has jettisoned them right out of the secret realm, sucking a teenager from the ordinary world into the mess they left behind them. Ethan Flynn is pretty useless in the African bush but at least he knows how to do CPR . . . and that’s when he finds out you shouldn’t do it on a witch. The one he just rescued from drowning says she switched places with his cousin and now Ethan has sucked up all her magical powers, leaving her too weak to switch back again. It must be true. Joe has vanished into thin air, Ethan’s feeling all unhinged, and the old woman’s leopard is communicating its thoughts straight into his head. . . . alarming thoughts about teaming up with fearsome characters and traveling into dark places; disturbing thoughts about Joe in terrible danger unless Ethan learns to use the magic in time to rescue him. That’s if Ethan himself can survive . . .	276	January 1st 2012		Lost Kingdom, Africa (Zimbabwe)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18333130-switch-the-lost-kingdoms-of-karibu
