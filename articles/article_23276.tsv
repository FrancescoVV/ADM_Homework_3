Breaking Free	Heartland #3	Lauren Brooke	4.11	3232	90	Heartland is a horse farm nestled in the hills of Virginia, but it's much more than that. Heartland is like no other place - it's a place where the scars of the past can be healed, a place where frightened and abused horses learn to trust again. Pegasus is all Amy has left of her past, but he's steadily growing weaker. Amy's trying to care for him and hold Heartland together. She's trying to do just what her mother would have done, but everything is beginning to unravel. It will take all Amy's courage to let go of her mother's legacy, but it is the only way she will break free and find her own.	148	2000	Amy Fleming, Jack Bartlett, Lou Fleming, Ty Baldwin, Soraya Martin, Matt Trewin, Scott Trewin, Val Grant, Ashley Grant, Lisa Stillman, Ben Stillman, Eliza Chittick		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/904966.Breaking_Free
