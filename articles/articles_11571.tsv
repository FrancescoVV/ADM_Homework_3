Fear of Physics: A Guide for the Perplexed		Lawrence M. Krauss	3.74	598	48	“Assume the cow is a sphere.” So begins this lively, irreverent, and informative look at everything from the physics of boiling water to cutting-edge research at the observable limits of the universe. Rich with anecdotes and accessible examples, Fear of Physics nimbly ranges over the tools and thought behind the world of modern physics, taking the mystery out of what is essentially a very human intellectual endeavour.	224	October 5th 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195155.Fear_of_Physics
