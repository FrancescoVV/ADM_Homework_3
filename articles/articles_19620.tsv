Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual: Volume 2: The Lower Extremities		Janet G. Travell, David G. Simons	4.78	51	3	Volume 1 provided a thorough understanding of what myofascial pain actually is, and discussed the approach to effective diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome from the waist up. This second volume offers the same effective approach for the lower body muscles. It includes features and reviews of special topics not discussed in other literature. These include an extensive review of the causes of functional scoliosis, and how to identify them clinically; a review of the lower limb length inequality that details radiographic techniques for for accurate measurement; how to examine intrapelvic muscles for trigger points; a topographical guide that simplifies distinguishing the three gluteal muscles and the piriformis muscle when palpating trigger points; the muscular origin of pain in sciatic, gluteal and perineal distributions; and an examination of the complexity of adductor longus muscle which helps explain why its importance is easily overlooked.	628	October 1st 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1247730.Myofascial_Pain_and_Dysfunction
