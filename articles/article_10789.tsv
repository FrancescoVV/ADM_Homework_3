The Mutiny on the Bounty Trilogy		Charles Bernard Nordhoff, James Norman Hall	4.38	1125	82	The story of the Bounty will be told as long as men sail the sea. The storytelling genius of the authors finds here a canvas filled with color, action and adventure. Readers will realize, as did the authors, that so large a drama could not be confined to the compass of an ordinary book. Nordoff and Hall chose to tell the story of the Bounty in three acts: Mutiny on the Bounty Men Against the Sea Pitcairn's Island In The Mutiny on the Bounty Trilogy these three books have been united in a single volume to form the complete work that the authors had in mind.	692	April 15th 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101862.The_Mutiny_on_the_Bounty_Trilogy
