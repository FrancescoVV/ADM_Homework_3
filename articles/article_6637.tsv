Bitten & Smitten	Immortality Bites #1	Michelle Rowen	3.68	7705	420	Dear Mom, I might be a wee bit late for Cousin Missy’s wedding. It’s been a tough week. Turns out, my blind date from hell was literally from hell. Guy bit me. Next thing I know, I’m being chased all over the city by vampire hunters. And did I mention that I got fired, too? Bright side-I met a man. Thierry de Bennicoeur. How great is that name? Anyway, he’s sexy, six-hundred years old, and a tad suicidal, but no one’s perfect, right? And we have a deal-he’s gonna show me the ropes of the vampire world, and I’m supposed to help him end his existence. Or maybe I’ll just try to convince him life is worth living – no small challenge with the mostly immortal, let me tell you. I’ll admit it’s a complicated relationship. But with any luck, I just might have a date for that wedding after all… Hugs and Kisses, Sarah	400	January 1st 2006	Michael Quinn, Sarah Dearly, Thierry de Bennicoeur		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68400.Bitten_Smitten
