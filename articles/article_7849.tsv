Cause of Death	Kay Scarpetta #7	Patricia Cornwell, C.J. Critt	3.94	44605	863	It is New Year's Eve, the last day of Virginia's bloodiest year since the Civil War. Dr. Kay Scarpetta plunges into the murky depths of a ship graveyard to recover the very human remains of Ted Eddings, an investigative reporter. What kind of story was Eddings chasing below the icy surface of the Elizabeth River? And why did Scarpetta receive a phone call from someone reporting the death before the police were notified? She soon discovers that Eddings' murder is merely the first layer of something much deeper --- a labyrinthine conspiracy that will put all of her criminal and forensic knowledge to the test like never before. For Scarpetts, the real challenge won't be cataloging the growing number of dead bodies, but preventing herself and those she loves from becoming the next victims.	356	August 1st 1996	Kay Scarpetta, Pete Marino, Lucy Farinelli, Benton Wesley, Dr. Phillip Mant, Captain Green	Virginia (United States), Richmond, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6541.Cause_of_Death
