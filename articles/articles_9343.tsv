The God-Stone War	Mageborn #4	Michael G. Manning	4.24	6183	74	Seven years have passed since Mordecai’s battle with the Shining God, Celior, and since that time his control of his abilities has vastly improved. He has at last envisioned a use for the ‘God-Stone’, but the gods want vengeance and now seek to destroy everything he has built. The secrets of the past threaten the future of his kingdom, his family, and perhaps humanity itself, unless Mordecai can discover the meaning of ‘Illeniel’s Doom’. How far will a desperate wizard go to protect his children… or will his efforts merely damn them all?	561	April 27th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15774082-the-god-stone-war
