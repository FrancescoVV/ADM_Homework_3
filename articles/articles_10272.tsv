More exciting still, she'll get to wear a disguise...Enter her alter ego: Honey. As flirty and feminine as a Bond girl, as confident and sexy as Mary Poppins in silk stockings, Honey brings out a side to Melissa she never knew she had. A side that will get her into hot water, (and out of it) and that she'll never want to lose...	406	June 6th 2005		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137098.The_Little_Lady_Agency
