Baby Love	Kendrick/Coulter/Harrigan #1	Catherine Anderson	4.04	6813	348	Desperate and determined, Maggie Stanley grabs her small baby and runs into the snowy Idaho night. In her loneliest, blackest hour, she unexpectedly finds a warmth and comfort she has never known in the tender compassion of a handsome, down-and-out stranger. In Rafe Kendrick, Maggie recognizes a soul wounded like her own—though she knows she must never trust any man ever again. Rafe is more than he seems—an enigmatic man of secrets who could give Maggie the moon, had he not vowed to spend his life alone. But sometimes love's flames can transform a cold world into paradise—and a man who's lost nearly everything, a woman who's forgotten how to dream, and the helpless child who needs them both can become that most wondrous creation: a family.	420	1999	Maggie Stanley, Rafe Kendrick	Squire, Idaho (United States), Crystal, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89363.Baby_Love
