The Last Witchfinder		James K. Morrow	3.51	1483	242	Jennet Stearne's father hangs witches for a living in Restoration England. But when she witnesses the unjust and horrifying execution of her beloved aunt Isobel, the precocious child decides to make it her life's mission to bring down the Parliamentary Witchcraft Act. Armed with little save the power of reason, and determined to see justice prevail, Jennet hurls herself into a series of picaresque adventuresâ€”traveling from King William's Britain to the fledgling American Colonies to an uncharted island in the Caribbean, braving West Indies pirates, Algonquin Indian captors, the machinations of the Salem Witch Court, and the sensuous love of a young Ben Franklin. For Jennet cannot and must not rest until she has put the last witchfinder out of business.	526	May 1st 2005		Colchester, England (United Kingdom), Salem, Massachusetts (United States), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218573.The_Last_Witchfinder
