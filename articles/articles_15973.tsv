The White Mountains	The Tripods #1	John Christopher	3.94	11743	883	Long ago, the Tripods—huge, three-legged machines—descended upon Earth and took control. Now people unquestioningly accept the Tripods' power. They have no control over their thoughts or their lives. But for a brief time in each person's life—in childhood—he is not a slave. For Will, his time of freedom is about to end—unless he can escape to the White Mountains, where the possibility of freedom still exists.	195	April 1967	Will, Henry, Beanpole		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64316.The_White_Mountains
