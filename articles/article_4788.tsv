Tunnels	Tunnels #1	Roderick Gordon, Brian  Williams	3.60	15615	1553	14-year-old Will Burrows has little in common with his strange, dysfunctional family. In fact, the only bond he shares with his eccentric father is a passion for archaeological excavation. So when his dad mysteriously vanishes, Will is compelled to dig up the truth behind his disappearance. He unearths the unbelievable: a subterranean society that time forgot. "The Colony" has existed unchanged for a century, but it's no benign time capsule of a bygone era. Because the Colony is ruled by a merciless overclass, the Styx. Will must free his father--is he also about to ignite a revolution?	464	July 2nd 2007	Will Burrows, Chester	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1175893.Tunnels
