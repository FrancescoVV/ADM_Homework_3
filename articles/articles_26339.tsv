Sorry		Zoran Drvenkar	3.55	2376	387	Four childhood friends, Kris, Tamara, Wolf, and Frauke, are a disaffected bunch of losers going nowhere. Then during one drunken night, they come up with an idea - they will set up an agency that, for a fat fee, apologises for all the wrongs in the world. The agency, which they call SORRY, becomes a runaway success.	325	2009		Berlin (Germany)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6424651-sorry
