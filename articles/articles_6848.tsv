Yet moments before death, someone mysteriously appeared and said, ‘Take my hand ...’ But Liam, Maddy and Sal aren’t rescued. They are recruited by an agency that no one knows exists, with only one purpose—to fix broken history. Because time travel is here, and there are those who would go back in time and change the past. That’s why the TimeRiders exist: to protect us. To stop time travel from destroying the world...	425	February 4th 2010	Lian O'Connor, Maddy Carter, Sal Vikram, Bob (TimeRiders)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6773432-timeriders
