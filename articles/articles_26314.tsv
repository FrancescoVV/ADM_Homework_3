The Call to Vengeance	Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice #16	Jude Watson, Cliff Nielsen	3.84	1467	43	Qui-Gon Jinn is a man on the edge. His heart has been shattered. His beliefs have been destroyed. And now he is dangerously close to stepping over a line that no Jedi dares to cross. He wants revenge. His fellow Jedi--his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jedi Council member Mace Windu--will try to stop him. But when Qui-Gon strikes out on his own, anything can happen. Revenge is not a Jedi trait . . . but it is a human one. Can Qui-Gon separate his personal feelings from his Jedi training.	134	December 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359827.The_Call_to_Vengeance
