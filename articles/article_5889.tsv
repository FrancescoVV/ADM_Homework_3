But deep down she’s panicking about how she’s going to survive her future when getting sucked into other people’s dreams is really starting to take its toll. Things get even more complicated when she meets her father for the very first time—and he’s in a coma. As Janie uncovers his secret past, she begins to realize that the choice thought she had has more dire consequences than she ever imagined.	214	February 9th 2010	Janie Hannagan, Cabel Strumheller		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7124095-gone
