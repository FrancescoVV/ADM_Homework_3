Who Moved My Cheese?	Who Moved My Cheese? #1	Spencer Johnson, Kenneth H. Blanchard	3.82	368957	12274	It is the amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life, for example a good job, a loving relationship, money or possessions, health or spiritual peace of mind. The maze is where you look for what you want, perhaps the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in. The problem is that the cheese keeps moving. In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change in their search for the cheese. One of them eventually deals with change successfully and writes what he has learned on the maze walls for you to discover.	96	1998	Scurry, Hem, Haw, Sniff		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894.Who_Moved_My_Cheese_
