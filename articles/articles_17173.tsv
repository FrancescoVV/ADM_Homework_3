Pearl in the Sand		Tessa Afshar	4.32	6792	821	Can a Canaanite harlot who has made her livelihood by looking desirable to men make a fitting wife for one of the leaders of Israel? Shockingly, the Bible's answer is yes. Pearl in the Sand tells Rahab's untold story. Rahab lives in a wall; her house is built into the defensive walls of the City of Jericho. Other walls surround her as well--walls of fear, rejection, and unworthiness. A woman with a wrecked past; a man of success, of faith...of pride. A marriage only God would conceive! Through the heartaches of a stormy relationship, Rahab and Salmone learn the true source of one another's worth and find healing in God.	320	August 1st 2010	Rahab (Bible), Salmone, Joshua (Bible)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8089607-pearl-in-the-sand
