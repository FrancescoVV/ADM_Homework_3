The Rules of Attraction		Bret Easton Ellis	3.69	40615	1389	Set at a small affluent liberal-arts college in New England eighties, The Rules of Attraction is a startlingly funny, kaleidoscopic novel about three students with no plans for the future—or even the present—who become entangled in a curious romantic triangle. Bret Easton Ellis trains his incisive gaze on the kids at self-consciously bohemian Camden College and treats their sexual posturings and agonies with a mixture of acrid hilarity and compassion while exposing the moral vacuum at the center of their lives. The Rules of Attraction is a poignant, hilarious take on the death of romance.	283	September 1987	Patrick Bateman, Sean Bateman, Lauren Hynde, Paul Denton, Victor Johnson	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9912.The_Rules_of_Attraction
