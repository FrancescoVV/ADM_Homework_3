Stoker's Shadow		Paul  Butler	3.67	6	1	Stoker's Shadow tells the story of the late Bram Stoker's surviving family members in 1922 as they struggle to come to grips with the dark undercurrents in the novel Dracula . Florence, Bram's widow, is shocked when a German company, Prana Films, pirates her late husband’s story for a film, Nosferatu . William, the son of Bram and Florence, is at first baffled by his mother’s discomfort, but he soon finds himself struggling with his own memories. Mary, Florence’s free-spirited young Irish companion, is captivated by 1920s London and all its mysteries. She finds escape in her copy of Dracula and forms an unlikely, and to Florence’s mind a dangerous, bond of friendship with William.
