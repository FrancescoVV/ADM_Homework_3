Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?		Raymond Carver	4.24	14197	878	With this, his first collection, Carver breathed new life into the short story. In the pared-down style that has since become his hallmark, Carver showed us how humour and tragedy dwelt in the hearts of ordinary people, and won a readership that grew with every subsequent brilliant collection of stories, poems and essays that appeared in the last eleven years of his life.	181	March 1st 1976			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11446.Will_You_Please_Be_Quiet_Please_
