Allow yourself to enjoy this immersive and enthralling tale set in medieval West Africa where Kings and Queens duel for power while mysterious creatures sent by the gods prepare to wage war upon them all. A generation has passed, and the devastation of war is slowly fading away but the scars remain, lingering in the hearts and minds of many. In an era of peace, King Ewuare remains conflicted, torn between opening closed wounds or allowing his reign of peace and prosperity to continue. As the King tries to resolve his moral conflict, the gods have a different agenda. Sinister and supernatural forces amass on the summit of the Agbon mountains, deep into the clouds, where no man dare stray, where the wind bites cold and the forest stays forever frozen. Within, lies a tale of Kings and Queens, warriors and commoners, slaves and sorcerers, and the consequences of their hurried actions. African tribes head to battle with swords forged of bronze and steel, wild beasts bending to the will of man and fighting side by side. A boy travels across the known world, through treacherous lands, in search of a hidden treasure. All amid betrayal of love, friendship and family. As a result, the survival of a people, culture and history hangs perilously in the balance.
