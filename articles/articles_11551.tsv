In Dubious Battle		John Steinbeck, Warren G. French	3.90	11531	747	At once a relentlessly fast-paced, admirably observed novel of social unrest and the story of a young man’s struggle for identity, In Dubious Battle is set in the California apple country, where a strike by migrant workers against rapacious landowners spirals out of control, as a principled defiance metamorphoses into blind fanaticism. Caught in the upheaval is Jim Nolan, a once aimless man who find himself in the course of the strike, briefly becomes its leader, and is ultimately crushed in its service.	304	1936	Jim Nolan	California (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56083.In_Dubious_Battle
