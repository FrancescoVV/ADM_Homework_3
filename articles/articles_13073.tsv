Me and My Bitch		David Weaver	4.39	457	24	What happens when a double crossed female goes to the greatest of all possible extremes to get her revenge? Absolute mayhem! This is a mind twisting, unpredictable, romantic nail biter from the same veins that brought you "A Love Story," and "Bankroll Squad!" The twists in this book are guaranteed to blow you away all the way to the last paragraph. This is that "I didn't see that coming" at it's very BEST! Brisk paced and will not bore you even for a minute. A winding roller coaster of events that will leave you speechless. You will not forget this story!!	160	September 12th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12619763-me-and-my-bitch
