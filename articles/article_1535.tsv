Moloka'i	Moloka'i #1	Alan Brennert	4.17	107700	9849	Set in Hawai'i more than a century ago, this is the story of Rachel Kalama, a spirited seven-year-old Hawaiian girl, who dreams of visiting far-off lands like her father, a merchant seaman. Then one day a rose-colored mark appears on her skin, and those dreams are stolen from her. Taken from her home and family, Rachel is sent to Kalaupapa, the quarantined leprosy settlement on the island of Moloka'i. Here her life is supposed to end---but instead she discovers it is only just beginning.	405	October 21st 2003	Rachel Kalama, Henry Kalama, Sarah Kalama, Kapono "Uncle Pono" Kalama, Haleola	Hawaii (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3273.Moloka_i
