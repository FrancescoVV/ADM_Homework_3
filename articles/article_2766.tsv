Instead, Jacky is becoming a skilled and respected sailor as the crew pursues pirates on the high seas. There's only one problem: Jacky is a girl . And she will have to use every bit of her spirit, wit, and courage to keep the crew from discovering her secret. This could be the adventure of her life--if only she doesn't get caught. . . .	304	June 6th 2002	Jacky Faber, James Emerson "Jaimy" Fletcher, Davy Jones		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295649.Bloody_Jack
