Dog Gone	Sam Holden #1	Diane Moat	4.15	185	26	A horribly murdered dog. A woman at a crossroads in her life. Samantha Holden finds the tortured body of a dog, launching her on a battle against animal abuse. The line between right and wrong quickly blurs, leading her down the path of bringing these abusers to justice. A path which calls for extraordinary - and sometimes illegal - measures. A modern day animal-avenger version of Robin Hood, Sam turns to robbery to fund her illegal projects. A mob family retiree, a housebound social media whiz, and a gorgeous Irishman who fences the things she steals, all are linked together in the search for the man who started it all. Can Sam balance this escalating crusade while keeping it all secret from her on-again, off-again boyfriend, who could cause it all to explode? If she finds the man she hunts, will either of them survive?	220	April 13th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29959799-dog-gone
