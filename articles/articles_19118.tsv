Friction in Motion		Sy Kadella	4.81	37	8	This dysfunctional family road trip is on the spectrum and off the beaten path...Ride along on a bumpy cross-country road trip with a highly dysfunctional family. On this trip an emotionally detached child prodigy with a history of therapist visits encounters a cast of quirky characters who validate his wishes to live his life independently. But none of the characters found on the road end up being as path-altering for him as his own immediate family. There are many lessons along the way. The most important being that wherever there is motion, there is bound to be friction, and within this lies the secret to wisdom and the strength to break free.	298	September 15th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081978-friction-in-motion
