Bridie and Finn		Harry Cauley	4.13	144	14	Bridie O'Connor is the most intriguing character Finn and his fourth-grade classmates have ever met. She is fearless, willing to say anything that comes into her mind, and everything about her is messy and a little off. It is love at first sight for Finn, but it will be almost a decade before he is ready to admit it. In graceful and seamless prose, Harry Gauley captures the world of a close-knit urban community and a way of life that exists no more.	355	January 1st 1994		New Jersey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/809972.Bridie_and_Finn
