What If It's Us	What If It's Us  #1	Becky Albertalli, Adam Silvera	3.91	66551	11099	Arthur is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it. Ben thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s things. But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them? Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated. Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited. But what if they can’t quite nail a first date . . . or a second first date . . . or a third? What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work . . . and Ben doesn’t try hard enough? What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play? But what if it is?	437	October 9th 2018	Arthur Seuss, Benjamin "Ben" Alejo, Dylan Boggs, Jessica "Jessie" Franklin, Ethan Gerson, Hudson Robinson	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36341204-what-if-it-s-us
