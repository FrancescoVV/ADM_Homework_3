Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy		Gary D. Schmidt	3.89	9243	1455	Not only is Turner Buckminster the son of the new minister in a small Maine town, he is shunned for playing baseball differently than the local boys. Then he befriends smart and lively Lizzie Bright Griffin, a girl from Malaga Island, a poor community founded by former slaves. Lizzie shows Turner a new world along the Maine coast from digging clams to rowing a boat next to a whale. When the powerful town elders, including Turner’s father, decide to drive the people off the island to set up a tourist business, Turner stands alone against them. He and Lizzie try to save her community, but there’s a terrible price to pay for going against the tide.	219	May 24th 2004		Phippsburg, Maine (United States), Malaga Island, Maine (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/165856.Lizzie_Bright_and_the_Buckminster_Boy
