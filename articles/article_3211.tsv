The First Phone Call from Heaven		Mitch Albom	3.75	55281	5372	The First Phone Call from Heaven tells the story of a small town on Lake Michigan that gets worldwide attention when its citizens start receiving phone calls from the afterlife. Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father, is determined to find out. An allegory about the power of belief--and a page-turner that will touch your soul--Albom's masterful storytelling has never been so moving and unexpected. Readers of The Five People You Meet in Heaven will recognize the warmth and emotion so redolent of Albom's writing, and those who haven't yet enjoyed the power of his storytelling, will thrill at the discovery of one of the best-loved writers of our time.	323	November 11th 2013	Sully Harding, Katherine Yellin, Tess Rafferty, Jack Sellers, Amy Penn	Coldwater, Michigan (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17888952-the-first-phone-call-from-heaven
