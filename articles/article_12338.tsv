White, Roger Angell	4.29	1583	191	Too personal for an almanac, too sophisticated for a domestic history, and too funny and self-doubting for a literary journal, One Man's Meat can best be described as a primer of a countryman's lessons a timeless recounting of experience that will never go out of style.	296	1942			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10813.One_Man_s_Meat
