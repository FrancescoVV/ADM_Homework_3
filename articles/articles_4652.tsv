Lick	Stage Dive #1	Kylie Scott	4.11	77149	6184	Waking up in Vegas was never meant to be like this. Evelyn Thomas’s plans for celebrating her twenty-first birthday in Las Vegas were big. Huge. But she sure as hell never meant to wake up on the bathroom floor with a hangover to rival the black plague, a very attractive half-naked tattooed man, and a diamond on her finger large enough to scare King Kong. Now if she could just remember how it all happened. One thing is for certain, being married to rock and roll’s favourite son is sure to be a wild ride.	286	July 1st 2013	Evelyn Thomas, David Ferris	Las Vegas, Nevada (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17983690-lick
