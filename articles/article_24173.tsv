NLP Workbook: A practical guide to achieving the results you want		Joseph  O'Connor	3.95	333	10	A practical, creative guidebook to achieving the results you want using Neuro Linguistinc Programming techniques Neuro-Linguistic Programming is based on the idea that the human mind is a sort of computer – our verbal and body language are the programmes which allow us to change our own thoughts and influence other people e.g. using body language and speech patterns to create instant rapport with someone else. We already use such techniques on a sub-conscious level – NLP simply helps us crystalise what we already know. This work book is a basic, at-home NLP course, providing easy-to-follow exercises and reflections to which the reader can return time and again. It addresses topics such as How to Change Emotional State, the Power of Language and Getting Results, and can be applied to all kinds of different areas e.g. business, sport, health. The NLP workbook is designed to be a basic manual for the beginner in NLP, and also a clear and easy reference manual for practioners and trainers.	304	January 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/258915.NLP_Workbook
