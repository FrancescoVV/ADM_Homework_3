Shadow of a Killer		David       Anderson	4.88	24	17	Cal's past comes back to haunt him. Then it comes back to kill him. Calvin Knox didn’t do anything criminal. He just committed a heinous offence against human nature – a desperate act of cannibalism high up the Andes Mountains. Even worse: the whole world knows the gory, shameful details. After a year of therapy Cal begins to get some normality back into his life. Then one day vengeance comes knocking on his door. Someone wants Cal to pay the ultimate price for his sins. Cal is torn between running, fighting, or accepting the summary judgment his unseen enemy will stop at nothing to meet out.	231	August 2nd 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41047974-shadow-of-a-killer
