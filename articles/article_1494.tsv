Silver Borne	Mercy Thompson #5	Patricia Briggs	4.38	94917	3139	Mercy Thompson, car mechanic and shapeshifter, never knows what the day - or night - may bring in a world where "witches, vampires, werewolves, and shapeshifters live beside ordinary people" ( Booklist ). But she is about to learn that while some secrets are dangerous whose who seek them are just plain deadly... Mercy is smart enough to realize that when it comes to the magical fae, the less you know, the better. But you can't always get what you want. When she attempts to return a powerful fae she previously borrowed in an act of desperation, she finds the bookstore locked up and closed down. It seems the book contains secrets - and the fae will do just about anything to keep it out of the wrong hands. And if that doesn't take enough of Mercy's attention, her friend Samuel is struggling with his wolf side - leaving Mercy to cover for him lest his own father declare Samuel's life forfeit. All in all, Mercy has had better days. And if she isn't careful, she may not have many more...	342	March 30th 2010	Adam Hauptman, Samuel Cornick, Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter), Mercy Thompson, Jesse Hauptman, Charles Cornick, Anna Latham, Darryl Zao, Warren Smith, Honey Jorgenson, Kyle Brooks, Stefan Uccello, Marsilia, Auriele Zao, Gabriel Sandoval, Tony Montenegro, Alicia (Ariana) Brewster, Ben Shaw	Tri-Cities, Washington (United States), Washington (state) (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6587387-silver-borne
