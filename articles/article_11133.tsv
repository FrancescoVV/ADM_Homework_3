As Meat Loves Salt		Maria McCann	3.90	4769	661	In the seventeenth century, the English Revolution is under way. The nation, seething with religious and political discontent, has erupted into violence and terror. Jacob Cullen and his fellow soldiers dream of rebuilding their lives when the fighting is over. But the shattering events of war will overtake them. A darkly erotic tale of passion and obsession, As Meat Loves Salt is a gripping portrait of England beset by war. It is also a moving portrait of a man on the brink of madness. Hailed as a masterpiece, this is a novel by a most original new voice in fiction.	565	January 1st 2001	Jacob Cullen, Christopher Ferris	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/271487.As_Meat_Loves_Salt
