Strangulation: Kubishime Romanticist	Zaregoto #2	NisiOisiN	4.29	481	29	The debut work from NISIOISIN, Zaregoto is NISIOISIN's twist on the I-novel where his narrator reveals a mystery and tries desperately to not take part in what transpires over the work. Full of intriguing young characters and action filled drama, Strangulation and Decapitation are the basis for the modern light novel movement creating a new genre of literature for Japan's X generation and beyond. College is a whole new adventure, rife with challenges, opportunities, and cold-blooded killers. Fresh from unmasking an assassin on a posh island paradise, Ii-chan is finally an ultra-cool college student--jaded, sarcastic, and not exactly consumed by academic ambition. Now more interested in angst and anomie than in catching killers, Ii-chan figures that danger is a thing of the past. Wrong! There's a homicidal maniac loose in Kyoto, a perp with the soul of an artist whose talent is apparent in the inspired way he festoons his crime scenes with body parts.	280	May 8th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4169252-zaregoto-book-2
