Tales of Protection		Erik Fosnes Hansen, Nadia Christensen	4.17	397	38	An eccentric scientist lies dead in his coffin reflecting on the past and his last experiment--collecting random incidents from human history and finding the underlying pattern that connects them. His reveries lead him to tell two other tales--one of a doomed lighthouse keeper on a Swedish island and the other of a rivalry among Renaissance artists--and finally he tells a startling tale from his own youth. For readers of Michael Ondaatje and Isak Dinesen, Erik Fosnes Hansen's imaginative narration brings an original and searching inquiry into why things happen the way they do and suggests a theory of "seriality"--a half-science about the power of human connections.	512	October 8th 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1621228.Tales_of_Protection
