Pollyanna	Pollyanna #1	Eleanor H. Porter	3.98	76933	2178	The orphan girl Pollyanna moves in with her strict aunt in New England. Despite a difficult start, Pollyanna's exuberance and positivity affect everyone who meets her, and she spreads joy and love wherever she goes. But when tragedy strikes, Pollyanna finds her optimistic attitude tested, and she must learn to find happiness again. A heartwarming tale that has become one of the most loved children's stories of all time, Eleanor H. Porter's 1913 best-seller—the first in a long series of Pollyanna novels by the author and other writers—is a beautiful story with a powerful moral message.	304	1913	Nancy, Pollyanna, Dr. Chilton, Jimmy Bean, Old Tom, John Pendleton, Polly Chilton	Vermont (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1000751.Pollyanna
