The Testing	The Testing #1	Joelle Charbonneau, Amélie Sarn, Amélie Hesnard	4.04	59894	6811	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Isn’t that what they say? But how close is too close when they may be one and the same? The Seven Stages War left much of the planet a charred wasteland. The future belongs to the next generation’s chosen few who must rebuild it. But to enter this elite group, candidates must first pass The Testing—their one chance at a college education and a rewarding career. Cia Vale is honoured to be chosen as a Testing candidate; eager to prove her worthiness as a University student and future leader of the United Commonwealth. But on the eve of her departure, her father’s advice hints at a darker side to her upcoming studies--trust no one. But surely she can trust Tomas, her handsome childhood friend who offers an alliance? Tomas, who seems to care more about her with the passing of every gruelling (and deadly) day of the Testing. To survive, Cia must choose: love without truth or life without trust.	325	June 4th 2013	Mina, Boyd, Malencia "Cia" Vale, Tomas Endress, Michal Gallen, Ryme Reynald, Zeen Vale, Hart Vale, Win Vale, Hamin Vale, Kip Drysten, Magistrate Owens, Malachi Rourke, Zandri Hicks, Daileen, Lyane, Geoff Billings, Flint Carro, Nicolette, Dr. Jedidiah Barnes, Annalise Walker, Brick Barron, Roman Fry	Tosu City, United Commonwealth	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13326831-the-testing
