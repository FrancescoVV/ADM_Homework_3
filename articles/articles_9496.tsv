Endure	Need #4	Carrie Jones	4.08	18252	1096	It’s all-out war (and no-holds-barred romance) in the climactic conclusion to Carrie Jones’s bestselling series. Zara is at the center of an impending apocalypse. True, she’s successfully rescued Nick from Valhalla, but it simply isn’t enough. Evil pixies are ravaging Bedford, and they need much more than one great warrior; they need an army. Zara isn’t sure what her role is anymore. She’s not just fighting for her friends; she’s also a pixie queen. And to align her team of pixies with the humans she loves will be one of her greatest battles yet. Especially since she can’t even reconcile her growing feelings for her pixie king . . . Unexpected turns, surprising revelations, and one utterly satisfying romantic finale make Endure a thrilling end to this series of bestsellers.	272	May 1st 2012	Nick McKenna, Zara White, Astley		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9915707-endure
