Silent in the Sanctuary	Lady Julia Grey #2	Deanna Raybourn	4.05	14611	1120	Fresh from a six-month sojourn in Italy, Lady Julia returns home to Sussex to find her father's estate crowded with family and friends— but dark deeds are afoot at the deconsecrated abbey, and a murderer roams the ancient cloisters. Much to her surprise, the one man she had hoped to forget—the enigmatic and compelling Nicholas Brisbane—is among her father's houseguests… and he is not alone. Not to be outdone, Julia shows him that two can play at flirtation and promptly introduces him to her devoted, younger, titled Italian count. But the homecoming celebrations quickly take a ghastly turn when one of the guests is found brutally murdered in the chapel, and a member of Lady Julia's own family confesses to the crime. Certain of her cousin's innocence, Lady Julia resumes her unlikely and deliciously intriguing partnership with Nicholas Brisbane, setting out to unravel a tangle of deceit before the killer can strike again. When a sudden snowstorm blankets the abbey like a shroud, it falls to Lady Julia and Nicholas Brisbane to answer the shriek of murder most foul.	552	December 28th 2007	Lady Julia Grey, Nicholas Brisbane, Portia, Lady Bettiscombe, Lord March, Morag, Magda, Eglamour "Plum" March, Lysander March, Violante, Alessandro Fornacci, Charlotte King, Lucy, Emma Phipps, Aunt Dorcas, Sir Cedric Eastley, Henry Ludlow, Lucian Snow	United Kingdom, Sussex, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1943742.Silent_in_the_Sanctuary
