The Onion Eaters		J.P. Donleavy	3.77	439	26	Clayton Claw Cleaver Clementine of The Three Glands is a medical rarity. On a grey cold day he sets off westwards to take up residence in the vast haunted edifice of Charnel Castle. Clementine, a polite unknown unsung product of the new world and recently recovered by a miraculous cure from a long decline, alights at an empty crossroads. Standing lonely on its windswept hillside, the great turrets and battlements rear in the sky. Clementine, destitute but for his monstrous dog Elmer and a collection of toothbrushes, enters this ancient stone fortress. Madness triumphs over love, beasts over man, chaos over reason and, for the moment, life over death.	290	1971			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/824920.The_Onion_Eaters
