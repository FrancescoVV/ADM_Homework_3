The Secrets of Existence and Fulfilment		D.U. Sivri	5.00	4	1	Whether it is dissatisfaction in our jobs or our relationships, feelings of insecurity, guilt, jealousy or low self-esteem, who amongst us hasn't gone through issues in our lives? Which of us wouldn't be happy to have some help to unravel the knots our minds tie themselves into? Using tried and tested techniques developed over years working as a psychotherapist, the author leads the reader through an examination of our minds and the many motivations and mechanisms which create us, and presents us with strategies to cope with, understand and eliminate those which serve no purpose but to hold us back.	297	June 30th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25662070-the-secrets-of-existence-and-fulfilment
