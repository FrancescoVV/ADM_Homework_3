Meridian	4.67	6	3	In the aftermath of the siege of Stonehold, High Prince Scabrous continues his pursuit to cleanse the deep world and claim the Twin Kingdoms. Serion needs to decide between doing what had been asked of him and doing what he believes is right, but will his actions bring more peril on those he intends to save? Leagues away Ash finds himself a captive, with no way of knowing what has become of his sister, Ember, Fox and Dan or if they are even still alive. He needs to find a way to free himself and save the demon Cazon, who is on the brink of being lost to pain and darkness. As war continues to roll over the deep world, danger lies around every turn, and so does treachery and ambition.	504	November 15th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43181675-deep-world-blood
