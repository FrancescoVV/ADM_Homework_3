Fifty-one Shades: A Parody (First Three Chapters)		Andrew Shaffer	3.50	5747	432	Read the first three chapters of "Fifty-one Shades: A Parody" , a rough draft excerpt from the forthcoming full-length parody novel, Fifty Shames of Earl Grey . Shaffer turns the BDSM love story between CEO Christian Grey and virginal college student Anastasia Steele into a comedy of errors. In "Fifty-One Shades: A Parody" , the unbelievably handsome Edward — er, “Chris Gray” — sweeps college student Bella — um, “Anna Steal” — off her feet and into his twisted world of kinky sex, dirty money, and board games (because every dark hero needs a lighter side). Will her best friend, the brony Jin, intervene to save her from her wealthy and perverted new boyfriend?	224	March 16th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13548945-fifty-one-shades
