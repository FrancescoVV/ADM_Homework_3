A World Without Princes	The School for Good and Evil #2	Soman Chainani, Iacopo Bruno	4.07	26534	2599	After saving themselves and their fellow students from a life pitched against one another, Sophie and Agatha are back home again, living happily ever after. But life isn't exactly a fairytale. When Agatha secretly wishes she'd chosen a different happy ending with Prince Tedros, the gates to the School for Good and Evil open once again.
