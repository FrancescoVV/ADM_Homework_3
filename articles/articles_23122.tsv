Teach Me Daddy		Rye Hart	4.05	509	153	I welcomed the isolation of the stony mountains. But there's one woman that haunts me to this day. For one night, I owned her. Her innocence. Her purity. It's been years and she has something that belongs to me: our daughter. Rose The icy cold mountains have nothing on Camillo. He has a thirst for dominance. Control. Power. Three years ago, I got a taste of what it meant to be with a real man. Those few hours of ecstasy were worth losing my virginity to a stranger. But, when I learned the truth about him I ran as fast as I could. Now he's shacked up in a cabin at the outskirts of town and I'm scared he knows my secret. Something tells me I can trust him, but I can't take any chances - no matter how badly I want to. Camillo My nephew deserves a life free from violence and pain. I traded a dangerous world for one that promised a clean slate. But no matter how hard I try - there's one person that still haunts me. For one perfect night, I owned her in every way imaginable. Now, she's the mother of my little girl. I'll do everything in my power to make Rose mine. And convince her I'm the family man she deserves. But, a dark past is coming back to haunt me - and everyone I love. They have no idea the hell I'm about to release. Because no one is laying a finger on my family.
