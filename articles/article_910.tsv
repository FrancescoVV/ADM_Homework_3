The Runaway Jury		John Grisham	3.99	273522	2126	Every jury has a leader, and the verdict belongs to him. In Biloxi, Mississippi, a landmark tobacco trial with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake begins routinely, then swerves mysteriously off course. The jury is behaving strangely, and at least one juror is convinced he's being watched. Soon they have to be sequestered. Then a tip from an anonymous young woman suggests she is able to predict the jurors' increasingly odd behavior. Is the jury somehow being manipulated, or even controlled? If so, by whom? And, more importantly, why?	358	1996	Wendall Rohr, Celeste Wood, Nicholas Easter, Rankin Fitch	United States of America, Biloxi, Mississippi (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24192.The_Runaway_Jury
