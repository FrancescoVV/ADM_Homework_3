He was a normal kid who just moved to the mundane, rural town of Hazeltine after being uprooted from a warm and exciting life in California. He was soon accompanied by three neighbors who quickly became his best friends. Their journey in life would be intertwined by the discovery of four stones. These hidden gems not only unlocked the magical realm of Monolitho, but granted them sacred powers that they could only dream of on earth.
