Silent Pantheon		Eric Nierstedt	4.27	233	19	Healer. Teacher. Gravedigger. Mother. Trickster. They live among us, performing the duties that once made them gods. Their names are whispers, drowned out by a single, mighty voice. They live under it, finding solace in the work and with each other, pretending not to remember the times when their songs were sung. But times are changing again. And darkness is rising. Those that have forgotten them will call for them again. But when they call, will these forgotten beings from distant lands heed it? Or will they abandon those who forgot their songs? Come take a first look at a world where myth and faith live together. Where those that are forgotten will choose between duty and anger. Where mankind will once again speak the names of the SILENT PANTHEON.	267	July 1st 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52917242-silent-pantheon
