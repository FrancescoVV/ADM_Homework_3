This Man Confessed	This Man #3	Jodi Ellen Malpas	4.40	76497	4080	THE STUNNING CONCLUSION TO THE THIS MAN TRILOGY! The Manor, the very place where their passionate love affair began, fills with guests on what should be the happiest day of Ava and Jesse's lives. She has accepted that she'll never tame the fierceness in Jesse-and she doesn't want to. Their love is profound, their connection powerful, but just when she thinks that she's finally gotten beneath his guarded exterior, more questions arise, leading Ava to believe that Jesse Ward may not be the man she thinks he is. He knows too well how to take her to a place beyond ecstasy . . . but will he also drive her to the brink of despair? It's time for this man to confess.	501	July 2nd 2013	Ava O'Shea, Jesse Ward		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255265-this-man-confessed
