Tyrant	King #2	T.M. Frazier	4.37	27715	2938	I. Remember. Everything. Only now I wish I didn't. When the fog is sucked away from my mind like smoke through a vacuum, the truth that has been beyond my reach for months finally reveals itself. But the relief I thought I would feel never comes, and I'm more afraid now than I was the morning I woke up handcuffed in King's bed. Because with the truth comes dark secrets I was never meant to know. I will put the lives of those I love most at risk if I let on that my memory has returned, or if I seek help from the heavily tattooed felon who owns me body and soul. I don't know if I'm strong enough to resist the magnetic pull toward King that grows stronger every day. He's already saved me in more ways than one. Now it's my turn to do whatever it takes to save him. Even if that means marrying someone else...	294	August 13th 2015	Brantley King, Doe, Tanner Redmond, Bear		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25711641-tyrant
