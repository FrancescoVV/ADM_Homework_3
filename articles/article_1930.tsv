The Hidden Oracle	The Trials of Apollo #1	Rick Riordan	4.23	110647	10578	How do you punish an immortal? By making him human. After angering his father Zeus, the god Apollo is cast down from Olympus. Weak and disorientated, he lands in New York City as a regular teenage boy. Now, without his godly powers, the four-thousand-year-old deity must learn to survive in the modern world until he can somehow find a way to regain Zeus's favour. But Apollo has many enemiesâ€”gods, monsters and mortals who would love to see the former Olympian permanently destroyed. Apollo needs help, and he can think of only one place to go... an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp Half-Blood.	375	May 3rd 2016	Nico di Angelo, Apollo (Greek god), Will Solace, Meg McCaffrey, Percy Jackson		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26252859-the-hidden-oracle
