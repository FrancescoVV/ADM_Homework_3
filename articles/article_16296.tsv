The Stranger's Child		Alan Hollinghurst	3.32	10400	1357	From the Man Booker Prizeâ€“winning author of The Line of Beauty: a magnificent, century-spanning saga about a love triangle that spawns a myth, and a family mystery, across generations. In the late summer of 1913, George Sawle brings his Cambridge schoolmate - a handsome, aristocratic young poet named Cecil Valance - to his family's modest home outside London for the weekend. George is enthralled by Cecil, and soon his sixteen-year-old sister, Daphne, is equally besotted by him and the stories he tells about Corley Court, the country estate he is heir to. But what Cecil writes in Daphne's autograph album will change their and their families' lives forever: a poem that, after Cecil is killed in the Great War and his reputation burnished, will become a touchstone for a generation, a work recited by every schoolchild in England. Over time, a tragic love story is spun, even as other secrets lie buried - until, decades later, an ambitious biographer threatens to unearth them. Rich with Hollinghurst's signature gifts - haunting sensuality, delicious wit and exquisite lyricism - The Stranger's Child is a tour de force: a masterly novel about the lingering power of desire, how the heart creates its own history, and how legends are made.	564	June 27th 2011	Cecil Valance, George Sawle, Daphne Sawle, Hubert Sawle, Freda Sawle, Clara Kalbeck, Dudley Valance, Sebby Stokes, Revel Ralph, Peter Rowe, Paul Bryant, Jenny Ralph, Corinna Keeping, Wilfrid Valance	England, Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7552716-the-stranger-s-child
