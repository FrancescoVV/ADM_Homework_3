A Hope Undaunted	Winds of Change #1	Julie Lessman	4.01	3598	361	What happens when the boy she loved to hate becomes the man she hates to love? The 1920s are drawing to a close, and feisty Katie O'Connor is the epitome of the new woman—smart and sassy with goals for her future that include the perfect husband and a challenging career in law. Her boyfriend Jack fits all of her criteria for a husband—good-looking, well-connected, wealthy, and eating out of her hand. But when she is forced to spend the summer of 1929 with Luke McGee, the bane of her childhood existence, Katie comes face-to-face with a choice. Will she follow her well-laid plans to marry Jack? Or will she fall for the man she swore to despise forever?	505	2010	Katie O'Connor, Jack Worthington, Luke McGee		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7506363-a-hope-undaunted
