Born of Blood	Palmetto Moon #1	Diana Collins	4.39	28	8	A young mother has vanished without a trace and Sophie D'Angelo has been hired to solve the cold case that left police stumped. Tensions are high between the local cops and the newly 'out of the coffin' vampire community, landing Sophie smack in the middle of the toughest mystery she's ever faced and in the middle of a possible civil war. Her only allies are her loud, overbearing Italian family and her ex-fiancee turned-vampire, Caleb, who shares her house, her business, and generally gets on her nerves. If he wasn't already dead, she'd probably kill him. As if that wasn't enough, Sophie has become the fixation of a twisted killer who is leaving a trail of bodies straight to her door. Can Sophie uncover the truth behind the strange disappearance and unmask her stalker before she, or someone she loves, becomes his next victim?	170	October 6th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12846322-born-of-blood
