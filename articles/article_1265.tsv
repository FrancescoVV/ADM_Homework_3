Demons		Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Richard Pevear, Larissa Volokhonsky	4.28	37501	1627	Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0679734511 . (ISBN13: 9780679734512) Inspired by the true story of a political murder that horrified Russians in 1869, Fyodor Dostoevsky conceived of Demons as a "novel-pamphlet" in which he would say everything about the plague of materialist ideology that he saw infecting his native land. What emerged was a prophetic and ferociously funny masterpiece of ideology and murder in pre-revolutionary Russia.	733	1872	Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky, Nikolai Vsevolodovich Stavrogin, Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky, Lizaveta Nikolaevna, Alexei Nilych Kirilov, Shigalyov, Ivan Shatov, Varvara Stavrogina, Captain Lebyadkin, Liputin	Russia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5695.Demons
