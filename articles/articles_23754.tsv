Right Wing Women		Andrea Dworkin	4.24	481	54	What does the Right offer to women? How does the Right mobilize women? Why is the Right succeeding in opposing women's rights? With the stark precision and forceful passion that characterize all of her work, Andrea Dworkin answers these timely questions. And by providing the first clear analysis of the impact on women of the Right's position on abortion, homosexuality, anti-Semitism, female poverty, and antifeminism, she demonstrates how the Right attempts both to exploit and to quiet women's deepest fears. â€” From the reverse cover.	255	1983			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/377163.Right_Wing_Women
