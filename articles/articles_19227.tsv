Who Left The P(o)ets Out?		George G. Asztalos	5.00	1	0	Check out my infrarealistic poems written in English from Romania, with all the pain and joy for this beautiful country. We made a Revolution to be left alone or to join the freedom. Read and find out. In and out we can only give our word of honor that we exist. And this is altogether amazing! https://play.google.com/store/books/d...	30	August 14th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43919836-who-left-the-p-o-ets-out
