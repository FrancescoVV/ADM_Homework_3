Red is for Remembrance	Blue is for Nightmares #4	Laurie Faria Stolarz	4.07	9172	299	I know you're alone... Shattered by her boyfriend's tragic death, Stacey is struggling in her first year of college, hoping that somehow, somewhere, Jacob is still alive. Now her nightmares are back, haunted by ghosts and misery. Casting healing spells brings Stacey closer to Porsha—a troubled girl who's also dreaming of death—and to a strange boy whose life is in danger. To save him, it'll take all the strength and magic they've got. And maybe even cost them their lives...	320	August 8th 2005	Stacey Ann Brown		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101914.Red_is_for_Remembrance
