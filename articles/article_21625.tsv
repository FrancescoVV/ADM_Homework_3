A Turn In The South		V.S. Naipaul	3.62	542	61	A thoughtful and beautifully crafted epilogue to the history of slavery A Turn in the South is a reflective journey by V. S. Naipaul in the late 1980s through the American South. Naipaul writes of his encounters with politicians, rednecks, farmers, writers, ordinary men and women, both black and white, with the insight and originality we expect from one of our best travel writers. Fascinating and poetic, this is a remarkable book on race, culture and country.	200	1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55707.A_Turn_In_The_South
