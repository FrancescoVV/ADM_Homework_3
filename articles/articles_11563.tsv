Magic to the Bone	Allie Beckstrom #1	Devon Monk	3.65	12683	839	Allie would rather moonlight as a Hound than accept the family fortune - and the strings that come with it. All magic use has costs -- hers include migraines and memory loss. She finds a boy dying from a magic Offload with her father's signature, then her father is murdered. Allie's search for the truth calls on her country friend and the handsome man originally assigned as her bodyguard. Someone is forging magic signatures -- and hers is on her dead father.	355	October 16th 2008	Allie Beckstrom, Zayvion Jones	Portland, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3241366-magic-to-the-bone
