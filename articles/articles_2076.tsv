The Clown		Heinrich Böll, Leila Vennewitz	3.99	21696	1397	Acclaimed entertainer Hans Schnier collapses when his beloved Marie leaves him because he won’t marry her within the Catholic Church. The desertion triggers a searing re-examination of his life—the loss of his sister during the war, the demands of his millionaire father and the hypocrisies of his mother, who first fought to “save” Germany from the Jews, then worked for “reconciliation” afterwards.	272	1963	Hans Schnier, Marie Derkum, Heribert Züpfner, Leo Schnier, Monika Silvs, Herbert Kalick, Karl Emonds, Heinrich Behlen, Bella Brosen, Alfons Schnier, Kinkel, Sommerwild, Fredebeul, Zohnerer, Mr. Derkum, Mr. Schnier, Sabina Emonds, Edgar Wieneken	Bonn (Germany), Germany	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69091.The_Clown
