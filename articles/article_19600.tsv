500 Miles from You	Scottish Bookshop  #3	Jenny Colgan	3.90	5360	780	New York Times bestselling author Jenny Colgan returns to the beloved Scottish Highland town of Kirrinfief, which readers first met in The Bookshop on the Shore , and adds a dash of London’s bustling urban landscape. Lissie, is a nurse in a gritty, hectic London neighborhood. Always terribly competent and good at keeping it all together, she’s been suffering quietly with PTSD after helping to save the victim of a shocking crime. Her supervisor quietly arranges for Lissie to spend a few months doing a much less demanding job in the little town of Kirrinfeif in Scottish Highlands, hoping that the change of scenery will help her heal. Lissie will be swapping places with Cormack, an Army veteran who’s Kirrinfeif’s easygoing nurse/paramedic/all-purpose medical man. Lissie’s never experienced small-town life, and Cormack’s never spent more than a day in a big city, but it seems like a swap that would do them both some good. In London, the gentle Cormack is a fish out of the water; in Kirrinfief, the dynamic Lissie finds it hard to adjust to the quiet. But these two strangers are now in constant contact, taking over each other’s patients, endlessly emailing about anything and everything. Lissie and Cormack discover a new depth of feeling…for their profession and for each other. But what will happen when Lissie and Cormack finally meet…?	288	June 9th 2020	Lissa Westcott, Cormac MacPherson, Jake Inglis, Kim-Ange, Kai Mitchell, Mrs. Mitchell, Mergim Kavaja, Dr Joan Davenport, Islay Coudrie, Gregor & Elspeth Coudrie, Bridie MacPherson, Ginty MacGuire, Emer., Mrs. Murray	Kirrinfief, Scotland (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53066550-500-miles-from-you
