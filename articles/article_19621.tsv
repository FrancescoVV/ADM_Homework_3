Allegiant: Divergent Trilogy, Book 3 by Veronica Roth | Summary & Analysis		Book*Sense	4.16	58	8	Allegiant: Divergent Trilogy, Book 3 by Veronica Roth | Summary & Analysis This is a Summary & Analysis of Allegiant. Award-winning author Veronica Roth brings the excellent Divergent series to a close in Allegiant. Although the book offers an end to the story of Tris Prior, it does not foreclose other works in her rich and eerily proximal narrative world. It is, instead, a novel that will please fans of the series and offer both scholars and causal readers much to consider. The novel relates the continued story of Tris Prior as she and her companions navigate the aftermath of the Edith Prior video. It takes them out of the changed Chicago as a war between those allegiant to the older Factional system—led by Johanna Reyes and Marcus Eaton—and those espousing a post-Factional society—led by Evelyn Johnson-Eaton—looms and introduces them to the agency that set up the Factions in the first place. This companion to Allegiant also includes the following: • Book Review • Story Setting Analysis of Allegiant • Story elements you may have missed as we decipher the novel • Details of Characters & Key Character Analysis • Summary of the text, with some analytical comments interspersed • Discussion & Analysis of Themes, Symbols… • And Much More! This Analysis of Allegiant fills the gap, making you understand more while enhancing your reading experience.	64	January 7th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24486751-allegiant
