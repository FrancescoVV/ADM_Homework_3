The Baron in the Trees	I nostri antenati #2	Italo Calvino, Archibald Colquhoun, Ana Goldstein	4.06	29213	1583	A landmark new translation of a Calvino classic, a whimsical, spirited novel that imagines a life lived entirely on its own terms Cosimo di Rondó, a young Italian nobleman of the eighteenth century, rebels against his parents by climbing into the trees and remaining there for the rest of his life. He adapts efficiently to an existence in the forest canopy—he hunts, sows crops, plays games with earth-bound friends, fights forest fires, solves engineering problems, and even manages to have love affairs. From his perch in the trees, Cosimo sees the Age of Enlightenment pass by, and a new century dawn. The Baron in the Trees exemplifies Calvino’s peerless ability to weave tales that sparkle with enchantment. This new English rendering by acclaimed translator Ann Goldstein breathes new life into one of Calvino’s most beloved works.	217	February 1957	Cosimo Piovasco, Biagio Piovasco, Arminio Piovasco	Liguria (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9804.The_Baron_in_the_Trees
