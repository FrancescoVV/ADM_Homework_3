The State of the Art	Culture #4	Iain M. Banks	3.85	13865	563	The first ever collection of Iain Banks' short fiction, this volume includes the acclaimed novella, The State of the Art. This is a striking addition to the growing body of Culture lore, and adds definition and scale to the previous works by using the Earth of 1977 as contrast. The other stories in the collection range from science fiction to horror, dark-coated fantasy to morality tale. All bear the indefinable stamp of Iain Banks' staggering talent.	188	March 1991	Diziet Sma, Dervley Linter, The Arbitrary, Roghres Shasapt, Tagm Lokri, Li'ndane, Lanyares Sodel, Djibard Alsahil, Tel Ghemada, Skaffen-Amstikaw	Earth	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129131.The_State_of_the_Art
