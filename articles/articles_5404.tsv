Anya's Ghost		Vera Brosgol	3.89	66347	5519	Anya could really use a friend. But her new BFF isn't kidding about the "Forever" part. Of all the things Anya expected to find at the bottom of an old well, a new friend was not one of them. Especially not a new friend who’s been dead for a century. Falling down a well is bad enough, but Anya's normal life might actually be worse. She's embarrassed by her family, self-conscious about her body, and she's pretty much given up on fitting in at school. A new friend—even a ghost—is just what she needs. Or so she thinks. Spooky, sardonic, and secretly sincere, Anya's Ghost is a wonderfully entertaining debut from author/artist Vera Brosgol.	224	June 7th 2011	Anya Borzatovskaya, Mrs. Borzatovskaya, Sasha Borzakovsky, Emily Reilly, Siobhan, Dima, Elizabeth, Sean, Preston		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9615347-anya-s-ghost
