And she takes flight - with his credit card. Alone in a strange city, Rosie begins to build a new life: she meets Bill Steiner and she finds an odd junk shop painting, 'Rose Madder', which strangely seems to want her as much as she wants it.

Rosie can feel just how close he's getting...	595	1995	Rose McClendon Daniels, Norman Daniels, American Law Enforcement		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10619.Rose_Madder
