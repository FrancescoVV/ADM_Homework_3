I Am David		Anne Holm, L.W. Kingsland	3.98	9894	937	David's entire twelve-year life has been spent in a grisly prison camp in Eastern Europe. He knows nothing of the outside world. But when he is given the chance to escape, he seizes it. With his vengeful enemies hot on his heels, David struggles to cope in this strange new world, where his only resources are a compass, a few crusts of bread, his two aching feet, and some vague advice to seek refuge in Denmark. Is that enough to survive? David's extraordinary odyssey is dramatically chronicled in Anne Holm's classic about the meaning of freedom and the power of hope.	256	1963	Mariecke, Carlos, Sophie, David Anlow, Johannes, The Man	Bulgaria, Switzerland, Denmark	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278958.I_Am_David
