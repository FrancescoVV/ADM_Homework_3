The Shell Seekers		Rosamunde Pilcher	4.16	95017	3203	Artist's daughter Penelope Keeling can look back on a full and varied life: a Bohemian childhood in London and Cornwall, an unhappy wartime marriage, and the one man she truly loved. She has brought up three children - and learned to accept them as they are. Yet she is far too energetic and independent to settle sweetly into pensioned-off old-age. And when she discovers that her most treasured possession, her father's painting, The Shell Seekers, is now worth a small fortune, it is Penelope who must make the decisions that will determine whether her family can continue to survive as a family, or be split apart.	530	1987	Penelope Keeling	Cornwall, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37095.The_Shell_Seekers
