As the second person to assume the role of Batman's sidekick, Jason Todd had a completely different personality than the original Robin. Rash and prone to ignore Batman's instructions, Jason was always quick to act without regard to consequences. In this fatal instance, Robin ignores his mentor's warnings when he attempts to take on the Joker by himself and pays the ultimate price. Driven by anger with Superman by his side, Batman seeks his vengeance as he looks to end the Joker's threat forever.	144	November 1st 1988	Jason Todd, Sandra Woosan, Bruce Wayne, Joker, Superman	Gotham City (United States), Lebanon, Ethiopia, New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107032.Batman
