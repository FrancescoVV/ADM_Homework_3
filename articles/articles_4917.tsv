The Reivers		William Faulkner	3.79	6575	427	One of Faulkner's comic masterpieces, The Reivers is a picaresque that tells of three unlikely car thieves from rural Mississippi. Eleven-year-old Lucius Priest is persuaded by Boon Hogganbeck, one of his family's retainers, to steal his grandfather's car and make a trip to Memphis. The Priests' black coachman, Ned McCaslin, stows away, and the three of them are off on a heroic odyssey, for which they are all ill-equipped, that ends at Miss Reba's bordello in Memphis. From there a series of wild misadventures ensues--invoving horse smuggling, trainmen, sheriffs' deputies, and jail.	305	1962	Lucius Priest, Boon Hogganbeck, Ned McCaslin, Miss Corrie, Miss Reba	Memphis, Tennessee (United States), Tennessee (United States), Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210825.The_Reivers
