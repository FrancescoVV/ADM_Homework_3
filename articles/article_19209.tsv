Concept's Forever		P.C. Clotter	5.00	2	1	One belief, one faith, the structure of the infinite Scapes, embody the ideals Concept: the Creator established nearly fifty billion years ago. Where all of his creatures coexist as equals amongst others complex and simple--all harboring the faith their maker bestowed them with. Living in harmony - by the philosophy of connection - eminently connected to the ones He has made for them; never born too far from one another. Those ones they are meant to be with: their Connected. Enero de Las Tierras Olvidadas, a nineteen year old Lost Child of La Pa√¨s Scape, makes his first venture outside his Scape to find and connect with his own. Ready to discover the legacy placed upon them: the rarest of all creatures mentioned sparsely in THE BOOK. However, through all of this quotidian connection, equality, harmony and honesty, trek those few bearing scathing turmoils - who make it their role to go against those very elements Concept imbued them with. Regardless of the countless ways existence crafts in homage to their Creator, whether it'd be language, arts or simply being, some choose breaking their links of him. Becoming Disconnected: a being whose connections unfortunately severed in their path not of Concept's design. And are climbing by reasons malignant. The correlation of a narrative unbound about family, faith, roles, "aspects" of existence and (dis)connection starts here.	179	July 1st 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40689907-concept-s-forever
