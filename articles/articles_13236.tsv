Phaedo		Plato, David Gallop, R.D. Archer-Hind	4.05	10192	369	The Phaedo is acknowledged to be one of Plato's masterpieces, showing him both as a philosopher and as a dramatist at the height of his powers. For its moving account of the execution of Socrates, the Phaedo ranks among the supreme literary achievements of antiquity. It is also a document crucial to the understanding of many ideas deeply ingrained in western culture, and provides one of the best introductions to Plato's thought.	144	-380			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/982310.Phaedo
