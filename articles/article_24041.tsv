What more can I say?"—David W. Hughes, The Observatory "[ Sidereus nunclus ] has never before been made available in its entirety in a continuous form, with full notes and comment. The introduction, translation and notes by Van Helden are a splendid example of the best scholarship and fullest accessibility. . . . we can now truly get to grips with the phenomenon of Galileo and what his life and work should mean to us today."—Robert Temple, Nature	135	March 12th 1610			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/984782.Sidereus_Nuncius_or_The_Sidereal_Messenger
