The Fact of a Doorframe: Poems Selected and New, 1950-1984		Adrienne Rich	4.24	3048	72	'Rich's writing has always lifted her naturally toward a unifying transcendental vision, a dream, but a dream simultaneously wrenched and weighted by its moral embodiment, called by her at different stages: love, truth, integrity, commonality, silence. She is a true metaphysical poet...(At times) her dialectical fire produces poems of transcendent beauty.'-Carol Muske, New York Times Book Review	358	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195211.The_Fact_of_a_Doorframe
