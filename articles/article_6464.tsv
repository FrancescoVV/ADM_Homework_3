Girl of Shadow		Holly Chavez	4.38	13	5	“Everyone’s guilty, but you’re only a villain if you’re caught; otherwise, you’re a legend.” –Izabel the Assassin “Do you have to poison someone again? We haven’t even had breakfast!” –Mirna the Friend “Justice doesn’t serve the innocent; it serves the guilty.” –Darick the Enforcer “Life is good for us. No one else matters; power, business, and family that’s all.” –The Boss “I want to see them all fall… I want to be the one to push them over the edge.” –Margery the Maid What happens when… …there are no royal families because they were all wiped out? …there are no presidents because democracy failed? …everything’s controlled by one man; one man who doesn’t have the support of the people? I’ll tell you, it’s the least I can do, but it won’t be pleasant. A story like this never is. Welcome to the world I live in, it’s cutthroat. Literally. If you have a weapon, keep it at hand. You never know when my story might become yours. You must prepare like I have. I am Izabel, The Boss’s daughter, and I am a murderer.	305	November 17th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27226764-girl-of-shadow
