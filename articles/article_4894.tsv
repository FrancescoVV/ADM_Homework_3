Archangel's Consort	Guild Hunter #3	Nalini Singh	4.23	37753	1728	Nalini Singh steps back into the shadows of her “heartbreakingly original”* world where angels rule, vampires serve, and the innocent can pay the greatest price of all… Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux and her lover, the lethally beautiful archangel Raphael, have returned home to New York only to face an uncompromising new evil… A vampire has attacked a girls’ school—the assault one of sheer, vicious madness—and it is only the first act. Rampant bloodlust takes vampire after vampire, threatening to make the streets run with blood. Then Raphael himself begins to show signs of an uncontrolled rage, as inexplicable storms darken the city skyline and the earth itself shudders. The omens are suddenly terrifyingly clear. An ancient and malevolent immortal is rising. The violent winds whisper her name: Caliane. She has returned to reclaim her son, Raphael. Only one thing stands in her way: Elena, the consort who must be destroyed… *Errant Dreams Reviews	324	January 1st 2011	Elena Deveraux, Raphael (Archangel), Illium (Angel), Sara Haziz, Ransom Winterwolf, Dmitri (Vampire), Jason (Angel), Venom (Vampire), Aodhan (Angel)	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7307503-archangel-s-consort
