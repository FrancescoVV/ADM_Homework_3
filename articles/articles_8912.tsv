Did I Mention I Miss You?	DIMILY #3	Estelle Maskame	4.10	12757	971	It’s been a year since Eden last spoke to Tyler. She remains furious at him for leaving her and has moved on with life in Chicago, where she is at University studying psychology. As school breaks up for the summer, she heads back to Santa Monica, but she’s not the only one with that idea… Despite their break-up and Tyler’s abrupt departure last summer, is there something Tyler is keeping from Eden? Are they both as over each other as they thought, and could Eden even begin to forgive Tyler? In Did I Mention I Miss You? , the explosive finale to Estelle Maskame’s phenomenal DIMILY trilogy, can Tyler and Eden finally work things out, against all the odds?	432	July 21st 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29852893-did-i-mention-i-miss-you
