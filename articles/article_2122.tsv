Guess How Much I Love You	Little Nutbrown Hare	Sam McBratney, Anita Jeram	4.36	126646	1778	"Guess how much I love you," says Little Nutbrown Hare. Little Nutbrown Hare shows his daddy how much he loves him: as wide as he can reach and as far as he can hop. But Big Nutbrown Hare, who can reach farther and hop higher, loves him back just as much. Well then Little Nutbrown Hare loves him right up to the moon, but that's just halfway to Big Nutbrown Hare's love for him.	20	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301736.Guess_How_Much_I_Love_You
