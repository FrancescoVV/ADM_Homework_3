Waiting for Godot		Samuel Beckett	3.83	161336	5630	The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men simply waiting for someone—or something—named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree, inhabiting a drama spun of their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and nonsense, which has been interpreted as mankind’s inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett’s language pioneered an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existential post-World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.	109	April 1st 1952	Estragon, Vladimir, Lucky, Pozzo, boy		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17716.Waiting_for_Godot
