All the World's a Simulation		Stephen Moles	4.38	8	4	Stephen Moles returns with his most complex and rewarding novel yet. All the World's a Simulation is a metafictional tour de force featuring Shakespeare, Snow White and an infinite number of evil Stephen Hawkings. While its main characters attempt to escape from it, the book constantly rewrites itself before the reader's gaze to reveal a profound secret about the power behind this and all other literary works. Thoroughly playful yet deeply serious, this extraordinary novel offers a personality-altering reading experience and an initiation into the realm of dark meaning. (This edition includes as an appendix two related works, the novellas Fossil People and Life.exe.)	356	May 1st 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40042603-all-the-world-s-a-simulation
