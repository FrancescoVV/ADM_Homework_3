Children of Dust: A Memoir of Pakistan		Ali Eteraz	3.54	752	97	“[Eteraz’s] adventures are a heavenly read.” — O , the Oprah magazine “In this supremely assured, lush, and rip-roaring book, Eteraz manages to do the impossible, gliding confidently over the chasm that divides East and West. Wildly entertaining…memoir of the first order.” —Murad Kalam, author of Night Journey Ali Eteraz’s award-winning memoir reveals the searing spiritual story of growing up in Pakistan under the specter of militant Islamic fundamentalism and then overcoming the culture shock of emigrating to the United States. A gripping memoir evocative of Persepolis , Reading Lolita in Tehran , and the novel The Kite Runner , Eteraz’s narrative is also a cathartic chronicle of spiritual awakening. Yael Goldstein Love, author of Overture , calls Children of Dust “a gift and a necessity [that] should be read by believers and nonbelievers alike.”	352	January 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8659588-children-of-dust
