This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor		Adam Kay	4.41	155810	10649	Welcome to the life of a junior doctor: 97-hour weeks, life and death decisions, a constant tsunami of bodily fluids, and the hospital parking meter earns more than you. Scribbled in secret after endless days, sleepless nights and missed weekends, Adam Kay's This is Going to Hurt provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the NHS front line. Hilarious, horrifying and heartbreaking, this diary is everything you wanted to know - and more than a few things you didn't - about life on and off the hospital ward.	256	September 7th 2017		London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35235302-this-is-going-to-hurt
