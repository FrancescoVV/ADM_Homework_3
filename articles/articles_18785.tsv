Gazing into the Eternal: Reflections upon a Deeper Purpose to Living		Belsebuub	4.21	142	20	Gazing into the Eternal is a collection of a number of Belsebuub’s key talks that provide an introduction to spiritual knowledge. It takes a clear and easy-to-understand look at some of the most profound questions we face, such as what happens when we die, is it possible to have the divine within, what are the causes of suffering, and how can spiritual realities be personally explored.
