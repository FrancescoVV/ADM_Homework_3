Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book	The Cottington Familyâ€™s Pressed Fairy Books	Terry Jones, Brian Froud	4.01	16001	245	This is a reproduction of the diary of Lady Angelica Cottingham, which features pressed garden fairies. Or rather the psychic images of the fairies, who quickly turned it into a game, where they leapt between the closing pages in an effort to outdo each other to produce the most outrageous poses.	64	1994	Angelica Cottington, Quentin Cottington		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227570.Lady_Cottington_s_Pressed_Fairy_Book
