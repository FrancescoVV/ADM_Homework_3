Amy Snow		Tracy Rees	4.00	10011	999	Left to perish on a bank of snow as a baby, Amy has never known love, never known family. Reluctantly given shelter at nearby Hatville Court, she is despised by the masters and servants alike. The beautiful Hatville heiress, Aurelia Vennaway, is Amy's only advocate - she becomes the light of Amy's life, and the centre of her existence. So when Aurelia dies young, Amy's world collapses. But Aurelia leaves Amy with one last gift. A bundle of letters with a coded key. A treasure hunt that only Amy can unlock. A life-changing secret awaits... if only she can reach it.	551	April 9th 2015	Amy Snow, Aurelia Vennaway, Wilberforce Ditherington, Charles Vennaway, Celestina Vennaway, Albert Crumm, Henry Mead, Larissa Nesbitt, Quentin Garland, Michael Vister, Madeleine Vister, Priscilla Vister, Oliver Vister, Hollis Vister, Louisa Vister, Edwin Vister, Constance Vister, Bailor Dunthorne, Daniel Renfrew, Ariadne Riverthorpe, Arabella Beverley, Joss Capland, Jeremiah Capland, Elspeth Capland, Verity Capland, Louis Josslyn Capland	Twickenham, London, England (United Kingdom), Hatville Court, Ladywell, Enderby (United Kingdom), Bath, Somerset, England (United Kingdom), York, Yorkshire, England , 1848, York, Yorkshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24993261-amy-snow
