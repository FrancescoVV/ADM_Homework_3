To Have and to Hold: A Tale of Providence and Perseverance in Colonial Jamestown		Mary    Johnston	3.99	660	105	A fledgling colony on the shores of the James River struggles desperately to survive and earn the good will of the King of England as Spanish dons, ruthless pirates, and lurking Indians plot to destroy Jamestown and its handful of colonists. Within this world, a simple, godly soldier braves all odds to defend his honor and his duty to uphold God’s sacred laws, all the while fighting to win the love of his new wife. To Have and to Hold brings to life the exciting beginnings of America, weaving a story of adventure, intrigue and romance with providence and perseverance in colonial Jamestown. This exciting story makes a wonderful family read-aloud, as well as a “can’t put down” book for the individual reader, capturing the imaginations of young and old, men and women alike.	429	1899	Captain Ralph Percy, Patience Worth	Jamestown, Virginia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/671844.To_Have_and_to_Hold
