When Darkness Tries to Hide	Montgomery Lake High #2	Stacy A. Padula	4.95	21	15	As the skies grow darker and darker over Montgomery Lake High, not everyone takes the severe storm warning seriously. A day later, Andy Rosetti—the popular class president—is in a coma, and his classmate Jason Davids feels responsible for the tragedy. As Andy’s friends and family cope with the aftermath of the storm, Jason and his friends set out on a quest to save Andy’s life. Stopping at nothing, Jason begins to see that there are forces stronger than nature at work in Montgomery—and more than one life in need of saving.	149	January 19th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34208026-when-darkness-tries-to-hide
