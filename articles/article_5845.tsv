Between the Lives		Jessica Shirvington	4.21	4912	958	Sabine isn't like anyone else. For as long as she can remember, she's had two lives. Every twenty-four hours she "shifts," living each day twice. In one life, Sabine has everything: popular friends, perfect grades, expensive clothes, and the guy everyone wants. In the other, Sabine's family struggles financially, and her friends are considered rebels. But then she meets Ethan. He's gorgeous and challenging, and he makes her feel like she's never felt before. All Sabine really wants is the chance to live only one life. But when this finally becomes possible, is she willing to risk everything - including losing the one person who might actually believe her - to make it happen?	336	May 1st 2013	Ethan, Sabine, Miriam, Capri Rivera Massey, Maddie, Dex, Ryan, Dr. Levi	Boston, Massachusetts (United States), Massachusetts (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17204984-between-the-lives
