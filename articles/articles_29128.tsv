Never Bite a Boy on the First Date		Tamara Summers	3.85	1954	164	I've got a few issues: I'm a vampire now. One of my classmates was found dead, with telltale fang marks. I didn't do it! (really!) Nobody believes me, so . . . I'm going to have to find the real killer. I've already got three suspects. (three very cute suspects.) One more problem: I am seriously falling for one of them . . . but what if he's the killer?	269	September 16th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6392859-never-bite-a-boy-on-the-first-date
