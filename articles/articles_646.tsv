The Haunting of Hill House		Shirley Jackson, Laura   Miller	3.84	166879	15787	It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, the lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powersâ€”and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.	182	October 16th 1959	Dr. John Montague, Eleanor Vance, Theodora (The Haunting of Hill House), Luke Sanderson, Mrs. Montague, Arthur Parker (The Haunting of Hill House), Mrs. Dudley	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89717.The_Haunting_of_Hill_House
