He never imagines he would encounter anyone whose intellect matched his own, much less an audacious teenage girl with a penchant for detection.

But when an elusive villain enters the picture, their partnership is put to a real test.	341	January 15th 1994	Mary Russell, Inspector Lestrade, Patricia Donleavy, Mrs Hudson (Conan Doyle series), Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes (Russell & Holmes series), Dr. John Watson	Sussex, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91661.The_Beekeeper_s_Apprentice
