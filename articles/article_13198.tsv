Simple Jess	Marrying Stone #2	Pamela Morsi	4.11	3102	321	The last thing widow Althea Winsloe wanted to do was remarry. Unfortunately, her meddlesome mountain neighbors had other plans. So, one autumn night they banded together and gave Althea a shocking ultimatum: She was to find herself a husband by Christmas...or the town would do it for her! Althea knew she had her choice of any single man in Marrying Stone, Arkansas. Yet the only one she felt truly comfortable with was Simple Jess. Sweet and gentle, Jess wasn't as smart as your average man. But his tender manner stirred Althea's heart in ways she had never dreamed possible. It would take a miracle to find a husband in Marrying Stone. But sometimes miracles are right under your nose.	325	April 1st 1996	Althea Winsloe, Jesse Best	Ozark Mountains (United States), Arkansas (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/692935.Simple_Jess
