Butterfly in Amber	Spotless #4	Camilla Monk	4.31	1268	203	He's waiting for you... Under a blanket of snow, surrounded by dark woods and a frozen sea, lies an ogre's castle. There lives a little princess, trapped in the maze of her own mind. On a battlefield where the past meets the present stand a fairy godmother and a pirate, an old ice cream man and a knight in shining clean armor... The clock is ticking fast, and to pierce the ogre's secrets and defeat him, Island Chaptal will have to fight to remember...and stay alive. Can the Lions and the Roomba cats be stopped before it's too late?	454	May 12th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34453613-butterfly-in-amber
