August: Osage County		Tracy Letts	4.19	15128	835	One of the most bracing and critically acclaimed plays in recent history, August: Osage County is a portrait of the dysfunctional American family at its finestâ€”and absolute worst. When the patriarch of the Weston clan disappears one hot summer night, the family reunites at the Oklahoma homestead, where long-held secrets are unflinchingly and uproariously revealed. The three-act, three-and-a-half-hour mammoth of a play combines epic tragedy with black comedy, dramatizing three generations of unfulfilled dreams and leaving not one of its thirteen characters unscathed.	138	February 1st 2008	Violet Weston, Beverly Weston, Barbara, Karen, Ivy	Pawhuska, Oklahoma (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2437710.August
