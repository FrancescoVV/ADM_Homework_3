He never thinks about the consequences because he doesn’t have to. Until Hartley Wright appears, shaking up his easy life. She’s the one girl who’s said no, despite being attracted to him. Easton can’t figure her out and that makes her all the more irresistible. Hartley doesn’t want him. She says he needs to grow up. She might be right. Rivals. Rules. Regrets. For the first time in Easton’s life, wearing a Royal crown isn’t enough. He’s about to learn that the higher you start, the harder you fall.	300	August 28th 2017	Easton Royal, Hartley Wright		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33807229-fallen-heir
