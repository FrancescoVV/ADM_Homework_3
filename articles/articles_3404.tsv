Until I Find You		John Irving	3.64	24715	1575	Every major character in Until I Find You has been marked for life – not only William Burns, a church organist who is addicted to being tattooed, but also William's song, Jack, an actor who is shaped as a child by his relationships with older women. And Jack's mother, Alice – a Toronto tattoo artist – has been permanently damaged by William's rejection of her. This is a novel about the loss of innocence, on many levels.	820	2005	Jack Burns, Emma Oastler, Michelle Maher		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9355.Until_I_Find_You
