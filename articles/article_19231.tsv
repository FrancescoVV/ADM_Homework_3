She Fell In Love With A Vicious Man		Tafiska Nyasulu Ndovi	4.67	9	1	Uchizi was born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth, lacked nothing, had a bespoke education and a promising career ahead of her, that is until she fell in love.... Though a sad story, you will love the story behind the book. The book also teaches us many love lessons. It also teaches us a lot about the choices we have in this world. I have taken my time to bring out the beauty the culture and the cuisine of Malawi from which the scene of the book is set. Enjoy.					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42852140-she-fell-in-love-with-a-vicious-man
