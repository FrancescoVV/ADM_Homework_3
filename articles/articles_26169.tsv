Dark Predator	Dark #19	Christine Feehan	4.24	11557	535	Christine Feehan delivers the most startling novel yet in her “must-read” series ( Night Owl Reviews ) as an immortal male comes to the end of a long and violent journey—to reach a far more dangerous and inescapable threat… As brutal as the undead he hunted, executioner Zacarias De La Cruz’s savage journey is over. After a thousand years in a gray world, he has accomplished everything he set out to do. His brothers are safeguarded, and each has a woman who completes him. But with his centuries as a killing machine now left to the past, and without a hunt to define him, Zacarias wonders, for the first time in his life, who he really is. The answer awaits him in the vengeance of an old enemy, in the consequences of a bloody family legacy and in Marguarita, a woman he once saved—his lifemate, his deliverance, and the greatest risk yet to both their lives.
