Get Well Soon	Anna Bloom #1	Julie Halpern	3.76	6298	640	Anna Bloom is depressed—so depressed that her parents have committed her to a mental hospital with a bunch of other messed-up teens. Here she meets a roommate with a secret (and a plastic baby), a doctor who focuses way too much on her weight, and a cute, shy boy who just might like her. But wait! Being trapped in a loony bin isn’t supposed to be about making friends, losing weight, and having a crush, is it? In her fiction debut, Julie Halpern finds humor in the unlikeliest of places, and presents a character whose voice—and heart—will resonate with all of us who have ever felt just a little bit crazy.	208	October 2nd 2007	Sandy, Anna Bloom, Justin MacFarlane, Matt O.		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457060.Get_Well_Soon
