The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break		Steven Sherrill	3.78	3466	486	Five thousand years out of the Labyrinth, the Minotaur finds himself in the American South, living in a trailer park and working as a line cook at a steakhouse. No longer a devourer of human flesh, the Minotaur is a socially inept, lonely creature with very human needs. But over a two-week period, as his life dissolves into chaos, this broken and alienated immortal awakens to the possibility for happiness and to the capacity for love.	313	May 1st 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/603260.The_Minotaur_Takes_a_Cigarette_Break
