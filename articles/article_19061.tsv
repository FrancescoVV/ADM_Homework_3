Irvine	3.87	905	66	The A young student at Oxford University has an idea for his doctor’s thesis (PhD), which fulfils not only the criteria for ‘originality’, but goes far beyond it. For if Jason Dyke is right, his idea will soon change the world and shift the delicate balance of power from one nation to another. Jason’s idea is simple: In the genetics laboratory at Oxford University, he will clone Jesus Christ . But when the CIA finds out about his plan, the President of America realises that if the UK succeeds, the balance of power will shift from the USA to Europe. And he realises that the only way to stop this happening is for America to create its very own clone of Jesus Christ. The race is on... Whoever reads this book will never forget it. And they will ask….one of two questions:- 1: Is it really possible? 2: When will it happen?	229	December 20th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34611151-the-messiah-conspiracy
