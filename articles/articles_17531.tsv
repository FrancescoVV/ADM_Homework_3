Bioweapon: New Beginnings		J.K. Bowden	4.19	16	3	"In the world of tomorrow peace reigns: but at a terrible price. The internet now binds people in a state of unified progress, achieved through a microchipped population who have been united in the face of destruction, and bent to the will of an insidious secret society who control every inch of the planet from the shadows. Those who have rejected the all-powerful New World Order are forced to flee to the most unliveable parts of the Earth, and are branded as rebels and secretly hunted to extinction. Their only hope lies in the incredible scientists who are at the forefront of the rebellion, and the deadly bioweapons they create. Meanwhile, Leah Sudeski, a London based private journalist, stumbles onto some shocking evidence that changes everything she has ever known about the ‘peaceful’ society she was born and raised in. Desperate for the truth she begins an impossible mission, aided by the rebels, in order to bring Truth and Freedom back to humanity.
