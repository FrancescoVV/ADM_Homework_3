The Enchanted April		Elizabeth von Arnim	3.93	17478	2591	A recipe for happiness: four women, one medieval Italian castle, plenty of wisteria, and solitude as needed. The women at the center of The Enchanted April are alike only in their dissatisfaction with their everyday lives. They find each other—and the castle of their dreams—through a classified ad in a London newspaper one rainy February afternoon. The ladies expect a pleasant holiday, but they don’t anticipate that the month they spend in Portofino will reintroduce them to their true natures and reacquaint them with joy. Now, if the same transformation can be worked on their husbands and lovers, the enchantment will be complete. The Enchanted April was a best-seller in both England and the United States, where it was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and set off a craze for tourism to Portofino. More recently, the novel has been the inspiration for a major film and a Broadway play.	232	1922	Lotty Wilkins, Rose Arbuthnot, Lady Caroline Dester, Mellersh Wilkins, Mrs. Fisher, Thomas Briggs	Italy	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3077.The_Enchanted_April
