The Snow Leopard		Peter Matthiessen	4.12	13392	1052	When Matthiessen went to Nepal to study the Himalayan blue sheep and, possibly, to glimpse the rare and beautiful snow leopard, he undertook his five-week trek as winter snows were sweeping into the high passes. This is a radiant and deeply moving account of a "true pilgrimage, a journey of the heart."	352	August 1978		Nepal	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764165.The_Snow_Leopard
