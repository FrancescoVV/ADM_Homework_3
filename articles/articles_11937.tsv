The Awful Rowing Toward God		Anne Sexton	4.22	734	79	From Wikipedia: Sexton's eighth collection of poetry is entitled The Awful Rowing Toward God. The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, although unwilling to administer last rites, told her "God is in your typewriter." This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing. The Awful Rowing Toward God and The Death Notebooks are among her final works and both centre on the theme of dying.	86	January 1st 1975			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/691014.The_Awful_Rowing_Toward_God
