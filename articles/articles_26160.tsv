Zvi		Elwood McQuaid	4.32	250	31	Zvi is the biography of a man who, like his nation Israel, defies explanation apart from God. His story in the early stages is reminiscent of the Book of Esther in the Bible--God is not consciously represented, yet He is obviously present and at work. One will recognize, as the story unfolds, that people and events touched Zvi's life at strategic points in ways that cannot be coincidental. Over the tortuous course he followed in his flight for survival, the reader will discern a clear pattern of divine provision. Unlike many of the stories that confront us today, this true-life epic has a satisfying climax. Zvi's life is far from over, of course, but the issue has been settled. He is alive today and living a joyfully triumphant life in the land of his fathers. How he survived the Holocaust, found his way to the shores of Israel, and faced his life-transforming encounter with the Messiah is a story one can ill afford to miss. A careful study of his life is a revelation of the lengths to which a loving Lord will go to bring one soul safely home.	202	March 31st 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55857.Zvi
