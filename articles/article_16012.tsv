Travis	Alluring Indulgence #3	Nicole Edwards	4.37	9036	730	The oldest of the Walker brothers opens a unique resort—catering to fetishes and fantasies—in this sizzling ebook from New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author Nicole Edwards. Travis Walker, the oldest of the seven Walker brothers, has been referred to as moody and mysterious, and for the most part, he would agree. Until recently, he spent his days helping his brothers run the family business. Now, he dedicates his time and energy to building a resort, Alluring Indulgence, that caters to fetishes and fantasies. And despite his attempt to work himself into the ground, Travis has never denied—at least not to himself—that something is missing. Ten years ago, Travis made the hardest decision of his life, breaking his own heart in the process. A decade later, he is learning that life has a strange way of turning things upside down before placing the pieces exactly where they were meant to go.	520	July 29th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17305041-travis
