Complicate Me	The Good Ol' Boys #1	M.  Robinson	4.02	9534	1143	It was complicated, it was also just the beginning. A decision. A simple choice. There is always that one moment in life where things could have been different. That one moment where you could have chosen a path that would lead you down a certain road. A different life. It was easier to pretend that we were still best friends, and that she was my girl and I was her boy. Pretending was better than knowing the truth... I. Ruined. Us. I had her. I lost her. I love her. All I did was complicate us. STANDALONE series.
