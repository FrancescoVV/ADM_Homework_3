Stars of Fortune	The Guardians Trilogy #1	Nora Roberts	4.01	27861	2221	Sasha Riggs is a reclusive artist, haunted by vivid dreams and nightmares that she turns into extraordinary paintings. Desperate to understand her visions, she finds herself drawn to the Greek island of Corfu. She has only just arrived when she encounters Bran Killian, an Irish magician with a warm charisma and secrets dancing in his eyes. Sasha has never met Bran before, but she knows him only too well - because this is the man from her dreams. The man she has painted over and over again. The man she seems fated to be with...if she can find the courage to accept who she really is. Sasha soon discovers that four other strangers have been lured to the island. Like Bran, they are all desperately searching for a mysterious jewel known as the fire star - before it falls into the wrong hands. Together, they might just succeed. But first they must learn to trust one another, and reveal their deepest secrets. On the sun-drenched island of Corfu, love and magic are sparked into life. And for Sasha, nothing will ever be the same again.	314	November 3rd 2015	Bran Killian, Sasha Riggs	Corfu (Greece)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611454-stars-of-fortune
