Cannery Row	Cannery Row #1	John Steinbeck	4.04	112317	5409	Cannery Row is a book without much of a plot. Rather, it is an attempt to capture the feeling and people of a place, the cannery district of Monterey, California, which is populated by a mix of those down on their luck and those who choose for other reasons not to live "up the hill" in the more respectable area of town. The flow of the main plot is frequently interrupted by short vignettes that introduce us to various denizens of the Row, most of whom are not directly connected with the central story. These vignettes are often characterized by direct or indirect reference to extreme violence: suicides, corpses, and the cruelty of the natural world. The "story" of Cannery Row follows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row. Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row.	181	January 1945	Eddie, "Doc" Bradley Stanwick, Dora, Lee Chong, Mack, Hughie, Gay, Hazel, Eddie, Doc, Dora, Lee Chong, Mack	California (United States), Monterey (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4799.Cannery_Row
