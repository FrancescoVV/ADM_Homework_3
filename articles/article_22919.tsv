Love & Luck	Love & Gelato #2	Jenna Evans Welch	3.79	11950	1957	"I wanted this to be real life, not a detour...." Addie is visiting Ireland for her aunt’s over-the-top destination wedding and hoping she can stop thinking about the one horrible thing that left her miserable and heartbroken—and threatens her future. But her brother, Ian, isn’t about to let her forget, and his constant needling leads to arguments and even a fistfight between the two once-inseparable siblings. But when Addie discovers an unusual guidebook, Ireland for the Heartbroken , hidden in the dusty shelves of the hotel library, she’s finally able to escape her anxious mind—and Ian’s criticism. And then their travel plans change. Suddenly Addie finds herself on a whirlwind tour of the Emerald Isle, trapped in the world’s smallest vehicle with Ian and his admittedly cute Irish-accented friend Rowan. As the trio journeys over breathtaking green hills, past countless castles, and through a number of fairy-tale forests, Addie hopes her guidebook will heal not only her broken heart, but also her shattered relationship with her brother. That is, if they don’t get completely lost along the way.	303	May 8th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32333026-love-luck
