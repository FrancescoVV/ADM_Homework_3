Bear, Otter, and the Kid	The Seafare Chronicles  #1	T.J. Klune	4.20	10613	1439	This edition is out of print. For current Paperback edition see: Bear, Otter and the Kid Three years ago, Bear McKenna’s mother took off for parts unknown with her new boyfriend, leaving Bear to raise his six-year-old brother Tyson, aka the Kid. Somehow they’ve muddled through, but since he’s totally devoted to the Kid, Bear isn’t actually doing much living. With a few exceptions, he’s retreated from the world, and he’s mostly okay with that - until Otter comes home. Otter is Bear’s best friend’s older brother, and as they’ve done for their whole lives, Bear and Otter crash and collide in ways neither expect. This time, though, there’s nowhere to run from the depth of emotion between them. Bear still believes his place is as the Kid’s guardian, but he can’t help thinking there could be something more for him in the world ... something or someone.	350	August 11th 2011	Tyson "Kid" James Thompson, Derrick "Bear" McKenna, Oliver "Otter" Thompson	Seafare, Oregon (United States), Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12156759-bear-otter-and-the-kid
