5 Centimeters per Second	秒速5センチメートル / Byousoku 5 Centimeter #1-2	Makoto Shinkai, Yukiko Seike, 清家 雪子, Melissa Tanaka	4.03	3424	454	Based on the Multiple Award Winning Film Remember a time before cell phones could be found in every pocket? Or when even accessing the world wide web was something only readily available in a library? Back then letters still filled up postboxes and moments just felt so much more precious when captured on Polaroid film. Now life seems to move at the speed of light. Our memories are captured and shared with the world on social media platforms. And love, which is already capricious, can feel like it is moving at terminal velocity. In Makoto Shinkai’s defining work, the internationally renowned director and animator unfolds a love story that is as timeless as it is fleeting. Yukiko Seike’s rendition of this modern classic adds a new level of emotion and intimacy that is unique to its source material.	464	November 14th 2007		Tokyo (Japan)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13153400-5-centimeters-per-second
