Storm and Silence	Storm and Silence #1	Robert Thier	4.50	19507	1764	Freedom—that is what Lilly Linton wants most in life. Not marriage, not a brood of squalling brats, and certainly not love, thank you very much! But freedom is a rare commodity in 19th-century London, where girls are expected to spend their lives sitting at home, fully occupied with looking pretty. Lilly is at her wits’ end—until a chance encounter with a dark, dangerous and powerful stranger changes her life forever... Enter the world of Mr Rikkard Ambrose, where the only rule is: Knowledge is power is time is money!	765	March 19th 2016	Lilly Linton, Mr. Ambrose	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24035804-storm-and-silence
