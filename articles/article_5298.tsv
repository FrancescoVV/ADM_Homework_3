A Lot like Love	FBI/US Attorney #2	Julie James	4.08	30099	1649	The FBI wants her cooperation... As the daughter of a billionaire and the owner of the city's top wine store, Jordan Rhodes is invited to the most exclusive parties in Chicago. But there's only one party the FBI wants to crash: the charity fundraiser of a famous restaurateur, who also happens to launder money for the mob. In exchange for her brother's release from prison, Jordan is going to be there—with a date supplied by the Bureau. Agent McCall just wants her... As the top undercover agent in Chicago, Nick McCall has one rule: never get personal. This "date" with Jordan Rhodes is merely an assignment—one they're both determined to pull off even if they can't be together for five minutes before the sarcasm and sparks begin to fly. But when Nick's investigation is compromised, he and Jordan have no choice but to pretend they're a couple, and what starts out as a simple assignment begins to feel a lot like something more.	274	March 1st 2011	Jordan Rhodes, Cameron Lynde, Jack Pallas, Nick McCall, Kyle Drake	Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8419428-a-lot-like-love
