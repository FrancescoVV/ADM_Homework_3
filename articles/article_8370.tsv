Dear Martin	Dear Martin #1	Nic Stone	4.37	45871	7970	Raw, captivating, and undeniably real, Nic Stone joins industry giants Jason Reynolds and Walter Dean Myers as she boldly tackles American race relations in this stunning debut. Justyce McAllister is top of his class and set for the Ivy League—but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. And despite leaving his rough neighborhood behind, he can't escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates. Justyce looks to the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr. King to find out. Then comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up—way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty cop beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it's Justyce who is under attack.	224	October 17th 2017	Justyce McAllister, Emmanuel "Manny" Rivers, Sarah-Jane "SJ" Friedman, Jarius "Doc" Dray, Jared Christensen, Blake Benson, Melo Taylor, Tomás Castillo	Atlanta, Georgia (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24974996-dear-martin
