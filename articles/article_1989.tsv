The Ersatz Elevator	A Series of Unfortunate Events #6	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	4.03	122101	3375	Dear Reader, If you have just picked up this book, then it is not too late to put it back down. Like the previous books in A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, there is nothing to be found in these pages but misery, despair, and discomfort, and you still have time to choose something else to read. Within the chapters of this story, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire encounter a darkened staircase, a red herring, some friends in a dire situation, three mysterious initials, a liar with an evil scheme, a secret passageway, and parsley soda. I have sworn to write down these tales of the Baudelaire orphans so the general public will know each terrible thing that has happened to them, but if you decide to read something else instead, you will save yourself from a heapful of horror and woe. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket	259	February 20th 2001	Count Olaf, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Arthur Poe, Duncan Quagmire, Isadora Quagmire, Violet Baudelaire, Esmé Squalor, Jerome Squalor	667 Dark Avenue, Café Salmonella, Veblen Hall	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/172327.The_Ersatz_Elevator
