Dorian Keller, an outrageous, openly gay man, finds himself in a world where fiction is fact. Having the most gorgeous man heâ€™s ever met tell him they are mated throws him for a loop, but hearing the man claim to be a vampire and learning that that he himself is a werewolf blows his mind and sends him running for the hills. But with the evidence put right in front of him, he is left with no choice but to adjust his thinking... especially since turning furry has become his new norm.
