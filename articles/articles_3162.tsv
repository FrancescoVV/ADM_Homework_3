To Have and Have Not		Ernest Hemingway	3.55	25499	1568	To Have and Have Not is the dramatic story of Harry Morgan, an honest man who is forced into running contraband between Cuba and Key West as a means of keeping his crumbling family financially afloat. His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who throng the region, and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair. Harshly realistic, yet with one of the most subtle and moving relationships in the Hemingway oeuvre, To Have and Have Not is literary high adventure at its finest.	176	1937	Harry Morgan	Havana (Cuba), Key West, Florida (United States), Florida (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4630.To_Have_and_Have_Not
