So You Want to Be a Wizard	Young Wizards #1	Diane Duane	3.83	25725	1159	Nita Callahan is at the end of her rope because of the bullies who've been hounding her at school... until she discovers a mysterious library book that promises her the chance to become a wizard. But she has no idea of the difference that taking the Wizard's Oath is going to make in her life. Shortly, in company with fellow beginner-wizard Kit Rodriguez, Nita's catapulted into what will be the adventure of a lifetimeâ€”if she and Kit can both live through it. For every wizard's career starts with an Ordeal in which he or she must challenge the one power in the universe that hates wizardry more than anything else: the Lone Power that invented death and turned it loose in the worlds. Plunged into a dark and deadly alternate New York full of the Lone One's creatures, Kit and Nita must venture into the very heart of darkness to find the stolen, legendary Book of Night with Moon. Only with the dangerous power of the wizardly Book do they have a chance to save not just their own lives, but their world...	323	1983	Christopher "Kit" Rodriguez, Juanita "Nita" Callahan, Khairelikoblepharehglukumeilichephriedosd'enagouni "Fred"	New York City, New York (United States), Hempstead, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116563.So_You_Want_to_Be_a_Wizard
