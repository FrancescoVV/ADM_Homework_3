His Accidental Daddy		Luna David	4.15	804	113	With the deck stacked against him from birth, Asher Simmons lives a quiet, simple life. He talks to plants more than he does humans and prefers it that way. Though he's always felt like something is missing, understanding what that is and how to get it feels like an insurmountable task. Making a living out of helping other's achieve their professional dreams serves to help Thornton Hayes realize his own. He’s also a Daddy, through and through, and Thornton’s one dream of finding a boy who needs a man to take care of his every need is one he’s had no luck of fulfilling. When a terrible accident brings the two men together, neither of them expect their intense connection. Has Daddy found a little he can pamper, protect, and provide for, or will Asher deny every instinct he has to regress?	292	April 13th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53008849-his-accidental-daddy
