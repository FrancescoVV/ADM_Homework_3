Last Train From Berlin: An Eye-Witness Account of Germany at War		Howard K. Smith	4.14	49	8	The memoirs of one of America's most distinguished correspondents--now with a new introduction and previously unpublished photos. Howard K. Smith worked as a young reporter in Berlin during Hitler's rise to power, and for the first two years of the Second World War. Finally granted a visa to leave the country--coincidentally on December 7th, 1941--he wrote everything censors had forbidden about the physical, emotional, and psychological manipulation of the German people by Hitler, Goebbels, and their lackeys. His personal experiences under difficult circumstances are extraordinary enough, but his descriptions of people forced to join the war, compulsory Nazi Youth groups, and of the German high command read like a chilling thriller.	272	June 30th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1492378.Last_Train_From_Berlin
