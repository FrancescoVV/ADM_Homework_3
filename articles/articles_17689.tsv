The Townsman		Pearl S. Buck, John Sedges	4.07	147	21	English born and pioneer bred, Jonathan had but two great passion in his life. One was the sea of waving grass known as Kansas. The other was the captivating Judy. The restless pushed westward in search of new land. But Jon saw in the raw frontier before him not a settlement of sod houses but a town with a future- where he too would have a future- to teach, to marry, to raise a family. His faith in both dream's was unshaken- until the impetuous Judy met Jonathan's closest friend.	441	January 1st 1944			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1556379.The_Townsman
