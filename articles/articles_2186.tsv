The Histories		Herodotus, Aubrey de SÃ©lincourt, John M. Marincola	3.99	41734	1213	One of the masterpieces of classical literature, the "Histories" describes how a small and quarrelsome band of Greek city states united to repel the might of the Persian empire. But while this epic struggle forms the core of his work, Herodotus' natural curiosity frequently gives rise to colorful digressions - a description of the natural wonders of Egypt; an account of European lake-dwellers; and far-fetched accounts of dog-headed men and gold-digging ants. With its kaleidoscopic blend of fact and legend, the "Histories" offers a compelling Greek view of the world of the fifth century BC.	716	-450	Leonidas, Xerxes I of Persia, Themistocles, Thales of Miletus, Cyrus the Great, Croesus, Aphrodite, Megabazus, Leutychides, Ister, Maeandrius, Histiaios, Harpagos, Kypselos, Artaphrenes, Massagetai, Adrastos, Kandaules, Hermotimos, Gorgos, Kleombrotos, Hekataios, Mardonlos, Bagaios, Labda, Kepheus, Necos, Apollo (Greek god), Artabazos I of Phrygia, Mardonius, Pausanias of Sparta, Solon (of Athens), Amasis II, Gyges of Lydia, Candaules of Lydia, Psamtik III, Psamtik I, Cambyses I, Tomyris (Massagetean Queen), Artemisia I of Caria, Eurybiades, Leotychidas, Hydarnes II, Artyphius	Cappadocia (Turkey), Lydia, Halys River (Turkey), Corynth (Greece) Sparta (Greece) Sardis (now: Sart) (Turkey) Ecbatana (Iran) Delphi (Greece) Ascalon (now: Ashkelon) (Israel) Cytherea (Greece) Babylon (Iraq) Athens (Greece) Marathon (Greece) Salamis (Greece), Corynth (Greece), Sparta (Greece), Sardis (now: Sart) (Turkey), Ecbatana (Iran), Delphi (Greece), Ascalon (now: Ashkelon) (Israel), Cytherea (Greece), Babylon (Iraq), Athens (Greece), Marathon (Greece), Salamis (Greece)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1362.The_Histories
