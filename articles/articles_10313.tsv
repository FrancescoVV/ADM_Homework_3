Undead and Unemployed	Undead #2	MaryJanice Davidson	3.93	33816	989	Nothing can make Betsy Taylor give up her shoe fetish - even dying and rising as the new Queen of the Vampires. Being royally undead isn't all it's cracked up to be - there are still bills to be paid. And Betsy is determined to live as normally as possible, even if it means getting a job. A "feet" she accomplishes with panache, landing her dream job selling designer shoes at Macy's. Things couldn't be better - except for her new friends, who keep pestering her while she's on the clock. As if she has time to socialize when there are deliciously sinful shoes to try on - and buy at a discount. It seems that vampires are being murdered in St. Paul, and they're all clamoring for Betsy to do something about it. The worse part is she's going to have to enlist the help of the one vamp who makes her blood boil: the oh-so-sexy Sinclair. Now, she's really treading on dangerous ground - high heels and all...	272	August 3rd 2004	Tina, Elizabeth "Betsy" Taylor, Eric Sinclair, Dr. Marc Spangler, Jessica Watson	St. Paul, Minnesota (United States), Minnesota (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153193.Undead_and_Unemployed
