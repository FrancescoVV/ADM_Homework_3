Drum Beats, Heart Beats (Dancing Soul Trilogy, #3)		Maria Nhambu	4.29	4118	7	In this final volume of The Dancing Soul Trilogy, we join an ever insightful and passionate Nhambu as she traverses diverse cultures and continents and negotiates a complex and shifting web of mixed identities—African immigrant and African American—through marriage, parenthood, and the search for the father she has never known. Through trauma and triumph, love and betrayal, the “Drum Beats” and “Heart Beats” of her native Africa lead her on an ultimate journey of transcendence that will enthrall and inspire readers around the world.	500	August 24th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41453422-drum-beats-heart-beats
