The Prince of Tides		Pat Conroy	4.23	194551	4271	PAT CONROY has created a huge, brash thunderstorm of a novel, stinging with honesty and resounding with drama. Spanning forty years, this is the story of turbulent Tom Wingo, his gifted and troubled twin sister Savannah, and their struggle to triumph over the dark and tragic legacy of the extraordinary family into which they were born. Filled with the vanishing beauty of the South Carolina low country as well as the dusty glitter of New York City, The Prince of Tides is PAT CONROY at his very best.	679	1986	Tom Wingo, Dr. Susan Lowenstein, Savannah Wingo, Luke Wingo, Lila Wingo, Henry Wingo, Sallie Wingo, Bernard Woodruff, Herbert Woodruff, Eddie Detreville, Tolitha Wingo, John Stanopolous, Reese Newbury, Amos Wingo	South Carolina (United States), New York City, New York (United States), Atlanta, Georgia (United States), Charleston's Fancy Amusement Park, Charleston, South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16735.The_Prince_of_Tides
