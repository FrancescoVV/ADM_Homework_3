The Canterville Ghost		Oscar Wilde, Inga Moore, Giada Riondino	3.89	42283	2554	This is Oscar Wilde's tale of the American family moved into a British mansion, Canterville Chase, much to the annoyance of its tired ghost. The family -- which refuses to believe in him -- is in Wilde's way a commentary on the British nobility of the day -- and on the Americans, too. The tale, like many of Wilde's, is rich with allusion, but ends as sentimental romance...	126	February 23rd 1887	Minister Mr Otis, Lord Canterville, Rev. Augustus Dampier, Duke of Cheshire		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45685.The_Canterville_Ghost
