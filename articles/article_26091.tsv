Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions		John Fire Lame Deer, Richard Erdoes	4.27	1733	116	Lame Deer Storyteller, rebel, medicine man, Lame Deer was born almost a century ago on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. A full-blooded Sioux, he was many things in the white man's world -- rodeo clown, painter, prisioner. But, above all, he was a holy man of the Lakota tribe. Seeker of Vision The story he tells is one of harsh youth and reckless manhood, shotgun marriage and divorce, history and folklore as rich today as ever -- and of his fierce struggle to keep pride alive, though living as a stranger in his own ancestral land.	352	1976			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226354.Lame_Deer_Seeker_of_Visions
