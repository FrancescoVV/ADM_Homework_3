Everything Is Always Gonna Be Alright, Durban Frankenshooze		Jamie McHone	4.36	492	7	Durban is a Durban bird with giant sneakers and wings so small he can't fly. He's tired of being made fun of by all the other flying birds, so he sets off on a journey to find out who he really is. Along the way, he meets Maudry, a smart and sassy female bird, and Wainwright, a grumpy worm with a short temper. Together, the unusual trio goes through thick and thin to discover what it really means to be yourself.	38	November 5th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51601327-everything-is-always-gonna-be-alright-durban-frankenshooze
