Dragons of Autumn Twilight	Dragonlance: Chronicles #1	Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman	3.99	108840	2190	Life-long friends, they went their separate ways. Now they are together again, though each holds secrets from the others in his heart. They speak of a world shadowed with rumors of war. They speak of tales with strange monsters, creatures of myth, creatures of legend. They do not speak of their secrets. Not then. Not until a chanced encounter with a beautiful, sorrowful woman who bears a magical crystal staff draws the companions deeper into the shadow forever changing their lives and shaping the fate of the world. No one expected them to be heroes. Least of all themselves.	444	November 12th 1984	Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Flint Fireforge, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Lauralanthalasa, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Lord Verminaard, Riverwind, Goldmoon		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259836.Dragons_of_Autumn_Twilight
