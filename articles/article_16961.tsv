Unlocking the Last Days: A Guide to the Book of Revelation and the End Times		Jeff Lasseigne	4.39	31	9	The very title of the last book of the Bible means "unveiling." Yet this mysterious and confusing book seems to do anything but unveil, especially when we read it on our own. Unlocking the Last Days takes readers through key parts of this misunderstood book, using a verse-by-verse approach that clearly communicates God's truth, warnings, and promises. Both Bible teachers and students will find this book a welcome aid to understanding an intriguing piece of the Scriptures.	333	March 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8118871-unlocking-the-last-days
