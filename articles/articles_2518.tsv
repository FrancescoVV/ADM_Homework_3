The Penultimate Peril	A Series of Unfortunate Events #12	Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist	4.05	89422	2374	Dear Reader, If this is the first book you found while searching for a book to read next, then the first thing you should know is that this next-to-last book is what you should put down first. Sadly, this book presents the next-to-last chronicle of the lives of the Baudelaire orphans, and it is next-to-first in its supply of misery, despair, and unpleasantness. Probably the next-to-last thing you would like to read about are a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing alon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavory curry. Next-to-last things are the first thing to be avoided, and so allow me to recommend that you put this next-to-last book down first, and find something else to read next at last, such a s the next-to-last book in another chronicle, or a chronicle containing other next-to-last things, so that this next-to-last book does not become the last book you will read. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket	353	October 18th 2005	Count Olaf, Sir, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire, Arthur Poe, Violet Baudelaire, Esm√© Squalor, Carmelita Spats, Vice Principal Nero, Geraldine Julienne, Kit Snicket		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65110.The_Penultimate_Peril
