The Reluctant Vampire	Argeneau #15	Lynsay Sands	4.27	12725	408	Has this immortal finally met her match? Rogue hunter Drina Argenis (from the Spanish side of the Argeneau family) has been many things in her years as an immortal, but bodyguard/babysitter to a teenage vampire is something new. There's an incentive, however: the other vampsitter, Harper Stoyan, may be Drina's life mate. Trouble is, having just lost a life mate, Harper is resigned to being alone. He's completely unprepared when sexy and unpredictable Drina bursts into his life to reignite his passions. Can Drina, with a little matchmaking help from their teen charge, tempt this reluctant vampire to take a chance? Or will a dangerous, unseen renegade kill Drina and Harper's one chance at happiness?	365	May 31st 2011	Harpernus "Harper" Stoyan, Alexandrina "Drina" Argenis	Port Henry (Canada)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6503156-the-reluctant-vampire
