My Life and Hard Times		James Thurber, Russell Baker, John K. Hutchens	4.13	3223	281	“Thurber is...a landmark in American humor...he is the funniest artist who ever lived.” — New Republic Widely hailed as one of the finest humorist of the twentieth century, James Thurber looks back at his own life growing up in Columbus, Ohio, with the same humor and sharp wit that defined his famous sketches and writings. In My Life and Hard times, first published in 1933, he recounts the delightful chaos and frustrations of family, boyhood, youth, odd dogs, recalcitrant machinery, and the foibles of human nature.	106	November 1933			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72995.My_Life_and_Hard_Times
