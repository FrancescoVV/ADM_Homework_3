Universes Within the Universe		Paola Sanjinez	4.83	6	3	Too often we believe that both the world and the universe are chaotic places, but what needs to be improved is not the universe as such, but the way we look at it. The insatiable quest for answers and the eternal desire for knowledge about how things work, knowing where we came from, where we are going, and why we do the things we do every day of our lives in a desire to get away from the chaotic, mundane spectacle and monotony, in searching for unknown, new experiences in each and every one of the cities of Bolivia, Maru ends up finding something much more valuable and unexpected than a simple tourist trip. She ends up finding the best gift, the gift of knowing who we are and what we are made of. Failing to realize that we are deep in our own problems, we have lost so much time worrying about survival that we have forgotten entirely what it means to live.	182	August 15th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16201523-universes-within-the-universe
