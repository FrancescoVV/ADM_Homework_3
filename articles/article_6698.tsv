Sheepfarmer's Daughter	The Deed of Paksenarrion #1	Elizabeth Moon	4.14	11472	596	Paksenarrion — Paks for short — is somebody special. She knows it, even if nobody else does yet. No way will she follow her father's orders to marry the pig farmer down the road. She's off to join the army, even if it means she can never see her family again. And so her adventure begins... the adventure that transforms her into a hero remembered in songs, chosen by the gods to restore a lost ruler to his throne. Here is her tale as she lived it.	506	June 1988	Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96278.Sheepfarmer_s_Daughter
