The Grimm Legacy	The Grimm Legacy #1	Polly Shulman	3.88	15433	2326	Elizabeth has a new job at an unusual library - a lending library of objects, not books. In a secret room in the basement lies the Grimm Collection. That's where the librarians lock away powerful items straight out of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales; seven-league boots, a table that produces a feast at the blink of an eye, Snow White's stepmother's sinister mirror that talks in riddles. When the magical objects start to disappear, Elizabeth embarks on a dangerous quest to catch the thief before she can be accused of the crime or captured by the thief. Polly Shulman has created a contemporary fantasy with a fascinating setting and premise, starring an ordinary girl whose after-school job is far from ordinary and leads to a world of excitement, romance and magical intrigue.	336	July 8th 2010	Elizabeth Rew, Marc Merritt, Anjali Rao, Aaron Rosendorn, Stan Mauskopf, Dr. Lee Rust	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6760780-the-grimm-legacy
