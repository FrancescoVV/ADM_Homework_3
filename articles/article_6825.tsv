Afterlife	Evernight #4	Claudia Gray	3.79	27061	1263	Destiny awaits Bianca and Lucas. . . . Bianca and Lucas believe they could endure anything to be together. When fate transforms Bianca into a ghostly wraith and turns Lucas into a vampire—the very creature he spent his life hunting—they are left reeling. There is only one place Lucas can turn for help . . . Evernight Academy. But the vampire hunters of Black Cross are still pursuing them, and a final battle between wraiths and vampires looms at Evernight. Bianca and Lucas are facing dangers on every side—sometimes even from their oldest friends and allies. They've overcome every obstacle life has thrown at them, but is their love strong enough to survive the challenges after life?
