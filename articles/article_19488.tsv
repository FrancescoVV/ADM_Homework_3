Bound to the Dark Prince	The Fae Wars #1	Aria Lovely	4.08	581	75	Two ancient courts at war. One Unseelie prince that yearns for peace. The first time I see him the world tilts off its axis. His eyes flash like quicksilver as they travel up my body. His lips, sensuous and wicked, tick up into a small smile that says I see you looking at me. I should have listened to my instincts: no one that attractive could be human. When I wake up in another realm, I very quickly learn three things about Cassiel: he's stupid hot, he's a Dark fae prince, and he's terrifying. So, like any sensible girl, I run away, looking for a way back home. But the surprises keep on coming as I try to stay alive in a world that's as beautiful as it is lethal. It turns out I’m not as mortal as I thought I was. There are secrets about my past I can't escape. And the Dark prince? He's my blood enemy. Aria Lovely’s debut novel is a sweeping, sumptuous fantasy romp with a dash of sizzling romance. If you enjoy a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers saga, the Fae Wars trilogy is for you!	255	March 20th 2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52582260-bound-to-the-dark-prince
