Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth		Chris Ware	4.09	21926	1317	Jimmy Corrigan has rightly been hailed as the greatest graphic novel ever to be published. It won the Guardian First Book Award 2001, the first graphic novel to win a major British literary prize. It is the tragic autobiography of an office dogsbody in Chicago who one day meets the father who abandoned him as a child. With a subtle, complex and moving story and the drawings that are as simple and original as they are strikingly beautiful, Jimmy Corrigan is a book unlike any other and certainly not to be missed. **ONE OF THE GUARDIAN 'S 100 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21st CENTURY**	380	September 12th 2000	Jimmy Corrigan	Michigan (United States), Chicago, Illinois (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34072.Jimmy_Corrigan
