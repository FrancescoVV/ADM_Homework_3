Girl, Woman, Other		Bernardine Evaristo	4.42	82163	8878	Joint Winner of the Man Booker Prize 2019 Teeming with life and crackling with energy â€” a love song to modern Britain and black womanhood Girl, Woman, Other follows the lives and struggles of twelve very different characters. Mostly women, black and British, they tell the stories of their families, friends and lovers, across the country and through the years. Joyfully polyphonic and vibrantly contemporary, this is a gloriously new kind of history, a novel of our times: celebratory, ever-dynamic and utterly irresistible.	453	May 2nd 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081373-girl-woman-other
