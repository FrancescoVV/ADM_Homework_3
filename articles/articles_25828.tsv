Sometimes I Lie		Alice Feeney	3.82	92621	11680	My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me: 1. I’m in a coma. 2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore. 3. Sometimes I lie. Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?	387	March 23rd 2017	Amber Reynolds, Paul Reynolds, Madeline Frost, Claire, Matthew, Edward, David (Sometimes I Lie)	England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32326398-sometimes-i-lie
