Milo: Sticky Notes and Brain Freeze		Alan Silberberg	3.89	2107	267	Loveable thirteen-year-old geek Milo Cruikshank finds reasons for frustrations at every turn, like the way his neighbor carves her pumpkin way too early to last until Halloween, or the fact that Summer Goodman won’t look twice at him while Hillary Alpert keeps leaving notes in his locker. The truth is, ever since Milo’s mother died, nothing has gone right. Now, instead of the kitchen being full of music, his whole house has been filled with Fog. Nothing’s the same. Not his Dad. Not his sister. And definitely not him. Ideal for any reader who has endured the loss of a loved one, Milo achieves a rare and easy balance of poignancy and awkward, natural humor, making it deeply accessible to every reader—this is the kind of book that can change lives.	288	September 14th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7172060-milo
