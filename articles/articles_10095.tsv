The Bridge Across Forever: A True Love Story		Richard Bach	3.85	11670	466	More than one year on the New York Times bestseller list! Richard Bach's timeless and uplifting classic of hope and love "We're the bridge across forever, arching above the sea, adventuring for our pleasure, living mysteries for the fun of it, choosing disasters triumphs challenges impossible odds, testing ourselves over and again, learning love and love and love!" "The opposite of loneliness, it's not togetherness. It is intimacy." "Look in a mirror and one thing's sure: what we see is not who we are." "Next to God, love is the word most mangled in every language. The highest form of regard between two people is friendship, and when love enters, friendship dies." "There are no mistakes. The events we bring upon ourselves, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what we need to learn; whatever steps we take, they're necessary to reach the places we've chosen to go."	400	June 12th 1982			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29948.The_Bridge_Across_Forever
