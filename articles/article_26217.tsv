Who Am I Without Him?: A Short Story Collection about Girls and Boys in Their Lives		Sharon G. Flake	4.14	1985	334	There is "The Ugly One," whose only solace comes when she is locked inside her own head. In "Wanted: A Thug," a teenager seeks advice on how to steal her best friend's bad-guy boyfriend. And then there's Erika, who only likes white boys. Sharon Flake takes readers through the minds of girls trying to define themselves while struggling to remain relevant to the boys in their lives. This is a complex, often humorous, always on-point exposition of black youth resolving to find self-worth . . . any way they know how.	168	May 1st 2004		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481912.Who_Am_I_Without_Him_
