The Vine Keeper . . . messages in Poetry and Prose		William S. Peters Sr.	5.00	7	2	Preface On the pages to come, awaits a journey as expressed through my verse. The words reflect an experiential-ness of my own and one that many of us at some level have had. The Vine Keeper is perhaps somewhat an “Egoic” examination of my inner self, my “Inner Child” and addresses many of the recurring questions and perhaps insights i may have had, or at least i thought i have had in my ‘Life Path’. Poetry for me as well as many others who i commune with tends to be the foundation of our Soul-felt reflections, our Emotions and the things we Think. One of my cherished quotes comes from the French Philosopher Descartes’ who coined the phrase ‘cogito ergo sum’ (i think therefore i am). Though many who read my work may defer in part or in its entirety from my perspectives, but what i must say is this . . . they are honest and therefore “Authentic” considerations of Creation, Life from most times a subjective point of view, and sometimes on rare occasions i touch on some things that may appear to be detached or quasi-objective. Throughout my life of wonder and discovery, my chief gripe perhaps would have been this. we are not taught to think creatively or independently of the machine. In The Vine Keeper i try. I hope, that this offering does justice to that dynamic which spawns you, the reader to look beyond the containment and remove the surreal lines in the Sand we think corral us.
