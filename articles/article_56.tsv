Water for Elephants		Sara Gruen	4.09	1384515	58907	Winner of the 2007 BookBrowse Award for Most Popular Book. An atmospheric, gritty, and compelling novel of star-crossed lovers, set in the circus world circa 1932, by the bestselling author of Riding Lessons. When Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned and suddenly adrift, jumps onto a passing train, he enters a world of freaks, drifters, and misfits, a second-rate circus struggling to survive during the Great Depression, making one-night stands in town after endless town. A veterinary student who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It is there that he meets Marlena, the beautiful young star of the equestrian act, who is married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. He also meets Rosie, an elephant who seems untrainable until he discovers a way to reach her. Beautifully written, Water for Elephants is illuminated by a wonderful sense of time and place. It tells a story of a love between two people that overcomes incredible odds in a world in which even love is a luxury that few can afford.	335	May 2006	Jacob Jankowski, August (Water for Elephants), Rosie Noah, Camel, Uncle Al, Kinko/Walter, Marlena L'Arche, Rosemary (Water for Elephants)	United States of America, Joliet, Illinois (United States), Ithaca, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants
