Red Harvest	The Continental Op #1	Dashiell Hammett	3.97	24047	1462	When the last honest citizen of Poisonville was murdered, the Continental Op stayed on to punish the guilty--even if that meant taking on an entire town. Red Harvest is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain.	224	February 1st 1929	The Continental Op, Elihu Willsson, Dinah Brand, Dick Foley		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30005.Red_Harvest
