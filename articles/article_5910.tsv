The Girl Who Was Supposed to Die		April Henry	4.05	9439	1386	“Take her out back and finish her off.” She doesn’t know who she is. She doesn’t know where she is, or why. All she knows when she comes to in a ransacked cabin is that there are two men arguing over whether or not to kill her. And that she must run. In her riveting style, April Henry crafts a nail-biting thriller involving murder, identity theft, and biological warfare. Follow Cady and Ty (her accidental savior turned companion), as they race against the clock to stay alive.	213	January 1st 2013		Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059396-the-girl-who-was-supposed-to-die
