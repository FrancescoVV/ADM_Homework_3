At Play in the Fields of the Lord		Peter Matthiessen	4.03	2772	256	In a malarial outpost in the South American rain forest, two misplaced gringos converge and clash. Martin Quarrier has come to convert the fearful and elusive Niaruna Indians to his brand of Christianity. Lewis Moon, a stateless mercenary who is himself part Indian, has come to kill them on behalf of the local comandante.Out of their struggle Peter Matthiessen has created an electrifying moral thriller, a novel of Conradian richness that explores both the varieties of spiritual experience and the politics of cultural genocide.	384	1965		United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/769729.At_Play_in_the_Fields_of_the_Lord
