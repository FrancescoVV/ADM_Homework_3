Confessions of a Shopaholic	Shopaholic #1	Sophie Kinsella	3.65	648972	12413	Becky Bloomwood has a fabulous flat in London’s trendiest neighborhood, a troupe of glamorous socialite friends, and a closet brimming with the season’s must-haves. The only trouble is, she can’t actually afford it—not any of it. Her job writing at Successful Saving magazine not only bores her to tears, it doesn’t pay much at all. And lately Becky’s been chased by dismal letters from the bank—letters with large red sums she can’t bear to read. She tries cutting back. But none of her efforts succeeds. Her only consolation is to buy herself something . . . just a little something. Finally a story arises that Becky actually cares about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life—and the lives of those around her—forever.	368	2000	Becky Bloomwood, Luke Brandon, Susan Cleath-Stuart, Tarquin Cleath-Stuart, Alicia Billington	Oxshott, Surrey, England (United Kingdom), London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9416.Confessions_of_a_Shopaholic
