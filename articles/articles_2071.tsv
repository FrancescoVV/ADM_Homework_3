Torment	Bloodlines #2	Lindsay Anne Kendal	3.97	331	31	Keira has been through Hell, literally..... But now she’s back, and stronger than ever! In this second gripping instalment of the Bloodlines trilogy Keira and her friends – Lily, Lucian, Tyler, Jake and Danny – continue to try and understand their elemental powers, and protect themselves from their enemies, whose ultimate goal is to destroy them. This time, the stakes are higher – what seems to be a demon rebellion has broken out in hell and the Earth is plunged into chaos. Their problem is, no one – not even Lucifer himself – knows who the rebel leader is. It seems only Keira, her frightened but determined friends, and a new ally – a demon named Eligos - can find out who this person or thing is, why they are suddenly causing so much bloodshed, pain and upset for everyone, and destroy them. Bloody awesome battles, amazing feats of magic, and a stronger-than-death passion, make for an intoxicating, unforgettable read in this powerfully imagined fantasy...	308	October 31st 2011	Lilith, Keira Jameson, Lily Tierney, Eligos, Lucian Turner, Tyler Rickman, Danny Goodwin, Jake Culver, Marley Roberts, Beth Roberts		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17974387-torment
