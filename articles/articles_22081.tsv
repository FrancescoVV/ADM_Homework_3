Black Beauty (Great Illustrated Classics)		Deidre S. Laiken, Anna Sewell	4.05	1842	101	A horse's life can be filled with love and tenderness. It can also be filled with meanness and cruelty. Black Beauty learns both sides of life in this classic tale by Anna Sewel. Told from the horse's point of view, Black Beauty's own story takes you into the mind and heart of a sensitive animal searching for love and understanding. From happy times as a young foal romping with his mother, Duchess, to harsh years as a cab horse in the city and finally to a peaceful old age, Black Beauty's life shows that horses have feelings too, and sometimes they even know things people don't.	240	1977		England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/747637.Black_Beauty
