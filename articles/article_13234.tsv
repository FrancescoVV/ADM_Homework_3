The Library Card		Jerry Spinelli	3.44	3056	351	Mongoose, Brenda, Sonseray, and April have nothing in common...until a mysterious blue card appears as if by magic and begins to change each of their lives. None of them guesses it at first, but that strange blue card will be their ticket to the past--and to a future that they never imagined. In stories that range from humorous to heartbreaking, Newbery-award-winner Jerry Spinelli reveals the amazing possibilities lurking behind library doors.	176	January 1st 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87218.The_Library_Card
