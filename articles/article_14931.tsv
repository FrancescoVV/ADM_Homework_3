A Need So Beautiful	A Need So Beautiful #1	Suzanne Young	3.70	5200	709	WE ALL WANT TO BE REMEMBERED. CHARLOTTE'S DESTINY IS TO BE FORGOTTEN. Charlotte's best friend thinks Charlotte might be psychic. Her boyfriend thinks she's cheating on him. But Charlotte knows what's really wrong: She is one of the Forgotten, a kind of angel on earth who feels the Need - a powerful, uncontrollable draw to help someone, usually a stranger. But Charlotte never wanted this responsibility. What she wants is to help her best friend, whose life is spiraling out of control. She wants to lie in her boyfriend's arms forever. But as the Need grows stronger, it begins to take a dangerous toll on Charlotte. And who she was, is, and will become - her mark on this earth, her very existence - is in jeopardy of disappearing completely. Charlotte will be forced to choose: Should she embrace her fate as a Forgotten, a fate that promises to rip her from the lives of those she loves forever? Or is she willing to fight against her destiny - no matter how dark the consequences?	267	June 21st 2011	Sarah Houplin, Charlotte Cassidy, Harlin, Monroe Swift	Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7656231-a-need-so-beautiful
