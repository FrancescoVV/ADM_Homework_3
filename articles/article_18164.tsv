The Sordid Promise	Breaking Insanity #1	Courtney Lane	3.90	1904	392	***Warning: Contains graphic language, frequent graphic sex, violence, and very dark themes. Can be read as a standalone. When physical pain allows you to escape your reality; what do you do when the pain is no longer strong enough to quiet the emotional ache? Diouana "Nikki" returned to her hometown six months ago to tend to her sick mother. She thought she'd left her "baggage" behind her on the opposite coast, only to find that it never left her side. As her self-destructive thoughts begin to consume her, her mother -- realizing Nikki's torment -- pushes Nikki to complete her last wishes. Eric Brenton, Nikki's new neighbor, lives in a dark, chaotic world that is easily hidden behind his model good looks and cocky demeanor. Unapologetic about his dirtier intentions, he sets his sights on Nikki with an offer to help her. But his help comes with very unorthodox conditions and a huge price. And Eric...comes with an extensive black box warning label.	300	March 23rd 2014	Dr. Eric Brenton, Diouana "Nikki" Givens		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26135992-the-sordid-promise
