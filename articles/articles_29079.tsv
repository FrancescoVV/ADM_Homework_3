Mrs. Jeffries Rocks the Boat	Mrs. Jeffries  #14	Emily Brightwell	4.01	588	49	Meet the inspector and Mrs. Jeffries--in a delightful mystery series set in Victorian England--and featuring the most charming characters ever to crack a case. Mirabelle Daws travelled all the way from Australia to Sheridan Square to visit her sister - only to die in the middle of a locked garden. All the residents of Sheridan Square have a key to the garden - but no-one seemed to know that Mirabelle was planning to arrive. So the question facing Mrs. Jeffries is: who wanted to make sure that Mirabelle's visit was very, very short-lived?
