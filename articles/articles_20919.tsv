No Matter How Loud I Shout: A Year in the Life of Juvenile Court		Edward Humes	4.18	794	79	In an age when violence and crime by young people is again on the rise, No Matter How Loud I Shout offers a look inside the juvenile court system that deals with these children and the impact decisions made in the courts had on the rest of their lives. Granted unprecedented access to the Los Angeles Juvenile Court, including the judges, the probation officers, and the children themselves, This book provides evidence of the system's inability to slow juvenile crime or to make even a reasonable stab at rehabilitating troubled young offenders. Humes draws a portrait of a judicial system in disarray.	400	1996			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189096.No_Matter_How_Loud_I_Shout
