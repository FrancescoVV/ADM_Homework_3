St. Martin's Summer		Rafael Sabatini	3.90	126	16	The life of an heiress is in jeopardy and her only hope is to place her trust in the wiles of a middle-aged swordsman with no use for "women's troubles." As the plots of the conspirators converge it will take all the wiles and accumulated wisdom of Martin Marie Rigobert de Garnache [to] uncover their identity, to save Valerie de La Vauvraye and keep his promise to his Queen.	184	1909			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1774421.St_Martin_s_Summer
