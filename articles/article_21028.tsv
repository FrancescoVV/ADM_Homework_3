The Sound of Us	Radio Hearts #1	Ashley Poston	3.59	895	138	America's favorite pop band, Roman Holiday, is done, dead, and so totally last year. For eighteen-year-old rockoholic Junie Baltimore, this is music to her ears. But when she discovers their sexy ex-lead singer hiding out on the boardwalk, her summer vacation becomes the cover story of the year. She's willing to keep him a secret, but when a sleazy paparazzo offers her the cash she needs to save the bar her father left behind, could she sell out for the chance to save her future? Who is she kidding? That's a no-brainer...but she never planned on falling head over heels for the lead singer.	250	December 19th 2013		Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18619593-the-sound-of-us
