Kiss Me, I'm Irish		John Blandly	5.00	4	2	Felicity Jones gives her younger sister, Dierdre, new luggage. Felicity bought two sets. That night, they go out to a club and tease the local men folk, though Dierdre has to get up early the next morning to fly to Chicago, where she is scheduled to cover an art exhibition. When Dierdre gets to Chicago she realizes she took the wrong luggage, and now only has Felicity's risky wardrobe. Then, without her glasses, she trips and falls into the arms of Steven Van Gogh, an artist she just met.	0	March 1st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24733068-kiss-me-i-m-irish
