The Power		Naomi Alderman	3.81	160575	18954	In The Power the world is a recognisable place: there's a rich Nigerian kid who lounges around the family pool; a foster girl whose religious parents hide their true nature; a local American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But something vital has changed, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power - they can cause agonising pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world changes utterly. This extraordinary novel by Naomi Alderman, a Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year and Granta Best of British writer, is not only a gripping story of how the world would change if power was in the hands of women but also exposes, with breath-taking daring, our contemporary world.	341	October 27th 2016	Roxy Monke, Allie Montgomery-Taylor (Mother Eve), Olatunde "Tunde" Edo, Margot Cleary, Jocelyn Cleary, Tatiana Moskalev, Darrell Monke	Lagos (Nigeria), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Manfouha (Saudi Arabia), Chișinău (Moldova) Delhi (India) Tucson, Arizona (United States) Basarabeasca (Moldova), Chișinău (Moldova), Delhi (India), Tucson, Arizona (United States), Basarabeasca (Moldova)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power
