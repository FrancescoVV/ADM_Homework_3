The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie		Muriel Spark	3.74	42822	2854	At the staid Marcia Blaine School for Girls in Edinburgh, Scotland, teacher extraordinaire Miss Jean Brodie is unmistakably, and outspokenly, in her prime. She is passionate in the application of her unorthodox teaching methods and strives to bring out the best in each one of her students. Determined to instill in them independence, passion, and ambition, Miss Brodie advises them, "Safety does not come first. Goodness, Truth, and Beauty come first. Follow me." And they do--but one of them will betray her.	150	1961	Jean Brodie, Gordon Lowther, Teddy Lloyd, Miss Mackay, Sandy Stranger, Rose Stanley, Mary Macgregor	Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/517188.The_Prime_of_Miss_Jean_Brodie
