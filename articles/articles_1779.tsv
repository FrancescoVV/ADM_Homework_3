Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.	331	October 19th 2011	Raffaella Cerullo (Lila), Elena Greco (Lenuccia), Stefano Carracci, Pasquale Peluso, Carmela Peluso, Ada Cappuccio, Antonio Cappuccio, Nino Sarratore, Enzo Scanno, Marcello Solara, Michele Solara, Rino Cerullo	Italy, Naples (Italy), Campania (Italy)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend
