Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade	Auntie Mame #1	Patrick Dennis, Edward Everett Tanner III, Paul Rudnick, Michael Tanner	4.07	9704	1102	Wildly successful when it was first published in 1955, Patrick Dennis' Auntie Mame sold over two million copies and stayed put on the New York Times bestseller list for 112 weeks. It was made into a play, a Broadway as well as a Hollywood musical, and a fabulous movie starring Rosalind Russell. Since then, Mame has taken her rightful place in the pantheon of Great and Important People as the world's most beloved, madcap, devastatingly sophisticated, and glamorous aunt. She is impossible to resist, and this hilarious story of an orphaned ten-year-old boy sent to live with his aunt is as delicious a read in the twenty-first century as it was in the 1950s.	299	December 1st 1955	Frank Crowninshield, Cond√© Montrose Nast, Patrick Dennis, Mame Dennis Burnside, Mr. Dennis, Norah Muldoon, Ito, Unforgettable Character, Eunice Babcock, Dwight Babcock, Jr., Ralph Devine, Natalie Devine, Florian McDermott, Horace Liveright, Elsie de Wolfe, Mrs. Riemenschneider, Jessie Franklin Turner, Neysa McMein, Henri Bendel, Frank Case, Euthanasia Gomez, Annie Laurie Williams, Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside, Mrs. Burnside, Fan Burnside, Willie Mae Burnside, Sally Randolph Burnside, Sally Cato McDougall, Emory Oglethorpe McDougall, Van Buren Clay-Pickett, Lightning Rod (horse), Basil Fitz-Hugh, Agnes Gooch, Mary Lord Bishop, Lindsay Woolsey, Bella Shuttleworth, Kit Cornell, Brian O'Bannion, Dr. Cheevey, Ernest Pugh, Bubbles from Newark, Biff (Fred Astaire Club), Bill (Fred Astaire Club), Jack (Fred Astaire Club), Alex (Fred Astaire Club), Professor Townsend, Mr. Townsend, Old Casey, Repulsive Remington, Gloria Upson, Claude "Buster" Upson, Doris Upson, Boyd Upson, Emily Upson, Deborah Upson, Abraham Bernstein, Sylvia Bernstein, Charlie Haddock, Miss Peabody, Miss Pringle, Edmund Jenkins, Gladys Martin (Auntie Mame), Enid Little, Albert (Auntie Mame), Ginger (Auntie Mame), Margaret Rose (Auntie Mame), Doc Potter, Michael "Mickey the Mick" Ryan, Pegeen Ryan Dennis, Margot Maddox, Miranda Maddox, Melissa Maddox (Auntie Mame), Mike Dennis, Vera Charles, Dwight Babcock	New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187060.Auntie_Mame
