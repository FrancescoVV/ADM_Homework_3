The Desert Princess (The Sultan's Heir, #2)		Christina  Bates	4.56	9	3	Princess Althea of Ronan hoped to have just a few days of freedom after she snuck out of the palace in the middle of the night. Instead, she finds herself abducted and sold into slavery in the neighboring desert land of Zaityraâ€¦ where she comes face to face with Sultan Ezhad. Enamored with the wayward lady of Ronan, Sultan Ezhad promises to change her negative view of his land and keep her safe as she remains a guest in his palace. Alone and afraid of the sultan finding out her true title, she keeps the secret that could topple an empire. But she finds herself not as alone as she thought when she discovers the Ronan spy in their midst. Together they must find a way to safely return her home without being found out and avoid the threat of war. The Desert Princess is a fantasy adventure that will appeal to lovers of fantasy adventure epics, young adult, romance, and historical fiction. It does contain violence, only a couple curse words, and talk of sexual situations (though not descriptive).	294	September 1st 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31823637-the-desert-princess
