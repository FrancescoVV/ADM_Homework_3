The Pale Horse	Ariadne Oliver #5	Agatha Christie	3.82	18019	1208	"Wickedness...such wickedness...." The dying woman turned to Father Gorman with agony in her eyes. "Stopped....It must be stopped....You will...." The priest spoke with reassuring authority. "I will do what is necessary. You can trust me." Father Gorman tucked the list of names she had given him into his shoe. It was a meaningless list; the names were of people who had nothing in common. On his way home, Father Gorman was murdered. But the police found the list and when Mark Easterbrook came to inquire into the circumstances of the people listed, he began to discover a connection between them, and an ominous pattern.... Every name of that list was either already dead or, he suspected, marked for murder.	288	1961	Ariadne Oliver, Mark Easterbrook, Major Despard, Rhoda Dawes, Inspector Lejeune, Dr. Jim Corrigan, Ginger Corrigan, Mr. Venables, Zachariah Osbourne, Mr Bradley, Thyrza Grey, Sybil Stamfordis, Bella Webb, Thomasina Tuckerton, Pamela "Poppy" Stirling, Reverend Dane Calthrop, Mrs Dane Calthrop, Mrs Tuckerton, Mrs Coppins, Mrs Davis, Father Gorman, Eileen Brandon, Hermia Redcliffe, David Ardingley		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95382.The_Pale_Horse
