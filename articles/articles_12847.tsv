Shoe Addicts Anonymous	Shoe Addict #1	Beth Harbison	3.59	27314	985	Helene Zaharis's politician husband keeps her on a tight leash and cancels her credit cards as a way of controlling her. Lorna Rafferty is up to her eyeballs in debt and can't stop her addiction to Ebay. Sandra Vanderslice, battling agoraphobia, pays her shoe bills by working as a phone sex operator. And Jocelyn Bowen is a nanny for the family from hell (who barely knows a sole from a heel but who will do anything to get out of the house). On Tuesday nights, these women meet to trade shoes, and, in the process, form friendships that will help them each triumph over their problemsâ€”from secret pasts to blackmail, bankruptcy, and dating. Funny, emotional, and powerful, Shoe Addicts Anonymous is the perfect read for any woman who has ever struggled to find the perfect fit.	327	June 12th 2007	Helene Zaharis, Lorna Rafferty, Sandra Vanderslice, Jocelyn Bowen, Senator Jim Zaharis	Washington, D.C.
