Happiness in Hard Times		Andrew Matthews	4.36	344	23	Happiness in Hard Times is about: surviving when you’re broke how happy people think – and how you can be like them liking yourself before you lose that extra weight persevering after you get the sack being happy before you meet your dream partner – and when they become a ‘learning experience!’ Filled with Andrew’s charming cartoons, and inspiring stories of people who have lost everything they had or almost been beaten by alcohol, illness, abuse or outrageous misfortune, Happiness in Hard Times shows us how we too can find our way through the pain to the contentment that seems out of reach.	160	2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15737855-happiness-in-hard-times
