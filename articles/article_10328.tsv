The Diviners	Manawaka Sequence	Margaret Laurence, Margaret Atwood	4.17	7158	257	The Diviners is the culmination and completion of Margaret Laurence's Manawaka cycle. This is the powerful story of an independent woman who refuses to abandon her search for love. For Morag Gunn, growing up in a small Canadian prairie town is a toughening process – putting distance between herself and a world that wanted no part of her. But in time, the aloneness that had once been forced upon her becomes a precious right – relinquished only in her overwhelming need for love. Again and again, Morag is forced to test her strength against the world – and finally achieves the life she had determined would be hers. The Diviners has been acclaimed by many critics as the outstanding achievement of Margaret Laurence’s writing career. In Morag Gunn, Laurence has created a figure whose experience emerges as that of all dispossessed people in search of their birthright, and one who survives as an inspirational symbol of courage and endurance. The Diviners received the Governor General’s Award for Fiction for 1974.	390	1974			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102661.The_Diviners
