Wolfsangel		John Reinhard Dizon	3.81	27	4	Wolfsangel is a historical novel based on the exploits of German commando Carl Hansen, whose Das Reich Division is recalled from the frozen wastelands of Western Russia to thwart the Allied invasion forces in 1944 Normandy. His love affair with his college sweetheart, French heiress Angelique Dagineau, becomes his reason to survive the cataclysmic battle ahead as the French Resistance rises across Southern France in a stalwart effort to block the Division from joining the fray. The tangled web of intrigue between the corrupt Vichy government forces, the Parisian criminal network and the Communist insurgents combine to add to the dangers facing Carl in completing his mission and returning to Angie at last. His situation grows more compromised as he receives word that Angie is missing and might be the target of a massive Gestapo manhunt for Underground operatives. This is a tale of romance and intrigue interwoven within an incomparable episode of 20th century history.	200	April 14th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31246793-wolfsangel
