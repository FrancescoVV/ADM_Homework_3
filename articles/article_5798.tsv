The Face on the Milk Carton	Janie Johnson #1	Caroline B. Cooney	3.72	54604	2905	The face on the milk carton looks like an ordinary little girl: hair in tight pigtails, a dress with a narrow white collar, a three-year-old who was kidnapped more than twelve years ago from a shopping mall in New Jersey. As fifteen-year-old Janie Johnson stares at the milk carton, she feels overcome with shock. She knows that little girl is she. But how could it be true? Janie can't believe that her loving parents kidnapped her, until she begins to piece together clues that don't make sense. Why are there no pictures of Janie before she was four? Her parents have always said they didn't have a camera. Now that explanation sounds feeble. Something is terribly wrong, and Janie is afraid to find out what happened more than twelve years ago. In this gripping page-turner, the reader will unravel—as Janie does—the twisted events that changed the lives of two families forever.	192	February 1st 1990	Janie Johnson, Reeve Shields	New York State (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19469.The_Face_on_the_Milk_Carton
