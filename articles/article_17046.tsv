But everything began to change the day he realised he has a psychic ability -- the power to alter the emotions of those around him. Mikhail is ushered into the Military Academy with others like him -- other Daevas -- where he does his part to help tip the scales of war against the vampires that destroyed the world and plague what remains of humanity. But after going up against his first vampire, Mikhail starts to question everything he thought to be true. To discover the truth and expose the lies he once believed, Mikhail will set out on a journey of discovery, and learn some things about himself in the process.	290	October 20th 2011	Mikhail Hart, Ashley White, Nathaniel Summers		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12353556-dawn-of-darkness
