The Silver Mist		Martin Treanor	4.18	89	26	Her dying father calls her unique, doctors have diagnosed that her "brain is wired wrong," and most say she's "plain simple," but Eve Hayes, a young Down's syndrome woman, feels only that she's different. Then, on 21 July 1972-Belfast's Bloody Friday-Eve encounters the captivating Esther, who ferries Eve on a sequence of illuminating, metaphysical journeys. In order to make sense of the slaughter that surrounds her, Eve must first learn the truth of her perceived difference, and therein unravel the timeless purpose of the silver mist.	300	February 21st 2011		Belfast, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11186809-the-silver-mist
