Endgame		Samuel Beckett	3.84	15480	697	Samuel Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969; his literary output of plays, novels, stories, and poetry has earned him an uncontested place as one of the greatest writers of our time. Endgame , originally written in French and translated into English by Beckett himself, is now considered by many critics to be his greatest single work. A pinnacle of Beckett's characteristic raw minimalism, it is a pure and devastating distillation of the human essence in the face of approaching death.	60	April 1st 1957	Nell, Hamm, Clov, Nagg		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287.Endgame
