Start the Game	Galactogon #1	Vasily Mahanenko, Boris Smirnov	4.19	1171	43	Twelve players set off through the online world of Galaktogon, lured by the game owners' promise of an enormous payoff. The question is, who will survive to tell the tale? Which of the twelve is a potential hero - or a traitor in the making? Which of them will defend the weak and who will become the ultimate evil overlord? A knight or a coward? Each of the twelve will have to choose his or her path. Each will keep a poker face. But if the billion-pound prize calls your name, you can't conceal your choice. And you will do everything to lay your hands on it.	305	September 7th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25963370-start-the-game
