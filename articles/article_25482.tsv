The Life of π		Jason Shaverin, Archimedes	3.90	677	30	The number pi (symbol: π) is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It has been represented by the Greek letter "π" since the early 1700s. Its decimal representation never settles into a permanent repeating pattern and never ends. The ubiquitous nature of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants, both inside and outside the scientific community. This book denotes π to 100,000 decimals.	42	April 7th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19193315-the-life-of
