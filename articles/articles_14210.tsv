Murder Must Advertise	Lord Peter Wimsey #8	Dorothy L. Sayers	4.21	18965	946	When ad man Victor Dean falls down the stairs in the offices of Pym's Publicity, a respectable London advertising agency, it looks like an accident. Then Lord Peter Wimsey is called in, and he soon discovers there's more to copywriting than meets the eye. A bit of cocaine, a hint of blackmail, and some wanton women can be read between the lines. And then there is the brutal succession of murders -- 5 of them -- each one a fixed fee for advertising a deadly secret.	356	1933	Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey, Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Victor Dean, Dian de Momerie, Major Milligan, Mr. Tallboy, Hector Puncheon		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/351559.Murder_Must_Advertise
