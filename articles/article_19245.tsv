24 HOURS TO BREXIT (BENEFICIARIES ODYSSEY Book 1)		Appollonia Solange	5.00	3	1	There are only 24-hours left to save the Brexit deal with Europe, but in the world of UK politics, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This story is a technothriller embracing alternative history for debate. As our lives get drastically changed by technology, we can actively use this as a lens through which we all embrace change, and our ability to cope with broader social and ethical issues in the society. Ada Eugène Kowalski, a rising political star, is thrust into the limelight just as the Prime Minister has resigned from office due to allegations of misconduct. Unbeknownst to the public and her Cabinet, Ada Eugène Kowalski is a Beneficiary—the result of a series of experiments pieced together after a German man’s accident during the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ada doesn't have the faintest idea how to run a country, let alone guide the UK through complex Brexit negotiations and the previous PM’s scandal. All Ada knows is there is no other option but to form alliances with old foes to save the country. Will Ada be able to navigate the complex world of The Consortium that wants to take over the world, the mysterious Factory of Spare Parts conducting military experiments on humans, the general public's propensity for sudden riots, and Parliament to bring the UK through Brexit in one piece?	89	December 16th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43264365-24-hours-to-brexit
