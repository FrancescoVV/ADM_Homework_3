But Dracula is the only thing on Earth that truly scares her, so when Dory has to go up against him, she'll take all the help she can getâ€¦ ...	373	August 26th 2008	Dorina Basarab, Louis-Cesare, Radu, Stinky, Mircea Basarab	New York State (United States), San Francisco, California (United States), Las Vegas, Nevada (United States), New York City, New York (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3072254-midnight-s-daughter
