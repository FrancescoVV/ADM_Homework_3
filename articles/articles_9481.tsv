Age of Myth	The Legends of the First Empire #1	Michael J. Sullivan	4.24	25991	2605	Age of Myth inaugurates another six-book series set in Elan. Since time immemorial, humans have worshipped the gods they call Fhrey, truly a race apart: invincible in battle, masters of magic, and seemingly immortal. But when a god falls to a human blade, the balance of power between humans and those they thought were gods changes forever. Now only a few stand between humankind and annihilation: Raithe, reluctant to embrace his destiny as the God Killer; Suri, a young seer burdened by signs of impending doom; and Persephone, who must overcome personal tragedy to lead her people. The Age of Myth is over. The time of rebellion has begun.	432	June 28th 2016			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26863057-age-of-myth
