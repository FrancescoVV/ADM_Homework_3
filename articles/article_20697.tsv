The Gift Of Acabar		Og Mandino, Buddy Kaye	4.14	1226	70	Two experts at tugging on one's heartstrings have created an enchanting parable you will never forget after you have opened your heart to the brave child who sent up a giant kite to capture a stare... and received far more than he expected. All Tulo had wanted was some light and warmth to sustain him and his tiny sister through the terrible storm and darkness. But this star, this celestial cinder of light which came floating down to the besieged village of Kalvala in the folds of Tulo's red kite, was far more than that. For one thing, Star Acabar could talk. "Hear me, Tulo! Adversity is not a curse, it is a blessing. Show me a human being who has never suffered adversity and I'll show you the most unhappy person on earth. You live in a world filled with people making excuses for their failure because it is always easier to quit than to keep trying." Why did this small star risk his very existence on this unusual mission to earth, his first in many centuries? "I came here to help you live at peace with yourself, Tulo, so that you can fulfill your own destiny with pride and a contented heart. And you will—if you heed my words and also make good use of my gift." For all those who dream of changing their lives for the better, Acabar's words... and his gift... now also belong to you.	128	1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/435030.The_Gift_Of_Acabar
