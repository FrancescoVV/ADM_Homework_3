Infinite Possibilities	The Secret Life of Amy Bensen #2	Lisa Renee Jones	4.05	8350	755	Secrets and lies. They are everywhere: haunting her, tormenting her. In the midst of it all, he’d been her escape, her passion. The only person she’d trusted in six years. And then he’d made her doubt that trust, cutting her deeply. But as she’d once told him, she was damaged, not broken. She is ready to fight and not just for survival. She is fighting for the truth and she won’t stop until she has it, not even for…him.	218	November 11th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23486458-infinite-possibilities
