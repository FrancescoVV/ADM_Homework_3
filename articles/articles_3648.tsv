Wildwood	Wildwood Chronicles #1	Colin Meloy, Carson Ellis	3.66	28279	3507	Prue McKeel's life is ordinary. At least until her brother is abducted by a murder of crows and taken to the Impassable Wilderness, a dense, tangled forest on the edge of Portland. No one's ever gone in, or at least returned to tell of it. So begins an adventure that will take Prue and her friend, Curtis, deep into the Impassable Wilderness. There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much greater, as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness. A wilderness the locals call Wildwood. Wildwood is the first in the Wildwood Chronicles trilogy.	541	August 30th 2011		Portland, Oregon (United States), Wildwood, Oregon (United States)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10431447-wildwood
