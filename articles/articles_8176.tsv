Reflex	Jumper #2	Steven Gould	3.97	6296	351	Davy has always been alone. He believes that he's the only person in the world who can teleport. But what if he isn't? A mysterious group of people has taken Davy captive. They don't want to hire him, and they don't have any hope of appealing to him to help them. What they want is to own him. They want to use his abilities for their own purposes, whether Davy agrees to it or not. And so they set about brainwashing him and conditioning him. They have even found a way to keep a teleport captive. But there's one thing that they don't know. No one knows it, not even Davy. And it might save his life....	380	December 1st 2004	David "Davy" Rice, Brian Cox, Millicent "Millie" Harrison-Rice, Hyacinth Pope, Lawrence Simons, Thomas P.
