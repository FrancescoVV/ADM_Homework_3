The Razor's Edge		W. Somerset Maugham	4.19	36611	2946	Larry Darrell is a young American in search of the absolute. The progress of this spiritual odyssey involves him with some of Maugham's most brillant characters - his fiancee Isabel, whose choice between love and wealth have lifelong repercussions, and Elliot Templeton, her uncle, a classic expatriate American snob. The most ambitious of Maugham's novels, this is also one in which Maugham himself plays a considerable part as he wanders in and out of the story, to observe his characters struggling with their fates.	314	1944	Elliott Templeton, Larry Darrell, Louisa Bradley, Sophie Macdonald, Gray Maturin, Isabel Bradley, Dr. Bob Nelson, Somerset Maugham	Paris (France), Chicago, Illinois (United States), France, French Riviera (France)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31196.The_Razor_s_Edge
