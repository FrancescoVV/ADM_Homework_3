A Taste for Death	Adam Dalgliesh #7	P.D. James	4.02	12631	537	When the quiet Little Vestry of St. Matthew's Church becomes the blood-soaked scene of a double murder, Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgliesh faces an intriguing conundrum: How did an upper-crust Minister come to lie, slit throat to slit throat, next to a neighborhood derelict of the lowest order? Challenged with the investigation of a crime that appears to have endless motives, Dalgliesh explores the sinister web spun around a half-burnt diary and a violet-eyed widow who is pregnant and full of malice--all the while hoping to fill the gap of logic that joined these two disparate men in bright red death. . . .	459	1986	Adam Dalgliesh, Kate Miskin, John Massingham, Paul Berowne, Harry Mack, Ursula Berowne, Stephen Lampart, Emily Wharton, Darren Wilkes, Miles Kynaston, Father Barnes, Barbara Berowne, Dominic Swayne, Evelyn Matlock, Sarah Berowne, Ivor Garrod, Carole Washburn	London, England (United Kingdom)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3830.A_Taste_for_Death
