    "\n",
    "Note: the formula doesn't give the lenght of the longest ordered sequence immediately but one has to take the maximum of $X(i)$ over all i to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S$ be a word of lenght $m$. We want to show that $X(i)$ is indeed the length of the longest sequence of characters in alphabetical order that terminates at the $i$-th character, as stated in the question. We prove this by strong induction on $i$. Also observe that we index the characters from $0$ to $m-1$ as one usually does in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that this holds for $X(0)$: every character in the first place is a valid string of length $1$ by default.\n",
    "Assuming the inductive hypothesis that the formula is correct up to $n-1$, we now show that it is also true for $X(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first observe the structure of the subproblems: if $S'$ is a valid substring of $S$ of lenght $k\\geq2$ that holds the property of being ordered alphabetically, then even the substring made of the first $k-1$ letters is an ordered substring (of lenght $k-1$). This also means that if one has a longest ordered sequence of characters that ends at position $h$, by removing the last character one has an ordered sequence ending at character at most $h-1$. Let's call this index $h'$. This is also a longest ordered sequence among those ending at $h'$: if it wasn't, then one could construct a longer sequence ending at $h'$ and this would make it possible to build an even longer sequence ending at $h$, creating a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now use the inductive hyphotesis: assuming the correctness of the formula up to $n-1$, it's easy to see that if the condition $S(j)<S(n)$ holds (with $j$ being the last letter of a word) then $X(n)$ has to be at least as big as the maximum of them + 1, since $S(j)<S(n)$ is exactly the condition one needs to add a letter. This proves that $X(i)$ is at least what's described in the formula. The value of $X(I)$ cannot be higher for the reason we discussed in the second paragraph: if it were, we could get a longer sequence for one of the lower indexes, contradicting the inductive hypothesis. This means that the formula for $X(i)$ is correct, since it cannot be higher or lower than what it is.\n",
